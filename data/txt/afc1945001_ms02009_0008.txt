Analysis can best be done by person trained in social psychol-
ogy. Local universities will generally have some such peers on their
staffs who can be recruited to serve in the project and supervise the
analysis. Rumor analysis should tell that rumors are being spread, with 
what frequency, in what circles. Such analyses show what the problem 
are, how serious they are, and toward whom information must be directed.

CONTROL PROGRAMS - INFORMATION
Once it has been decided to blanket a bocce field with infor-
mation, every cutlet open to the project should be used. It is important
to reach every group in the community, so that the groups in which the
particular rumors were most prevalent can be directly appealed to. Pub-
licity outlets used should therefore, include newspapers, group and club
publications, lectures before civic and club groups, radio interviews,
speeches, or programs, pamphlets and posters, school projects, library
displays, discussion group materials, etc. The project might consider
the value of asking editors to contribute space for columns called "Did 
You Know That?" or "Things You Ought to Know," the project providing color-
ful and dramatic information designed to answer rumors without specifically
mentioning them.

THE CONTINUING PROGRAM
In addition to the special education campaigns worked out
on the basis of information gaps, the continuing information purpose
of a rumor control project is to toughen people's minds against rumors.

There are several simple rules the project could help to pub-
licize as its major campaign. These rules are:

1. Never repeat a rumor.
2. Do not repeat a rumor verbally even to deny it.
3. If you know the facts which can spike a rumor, cite the 
facts promptly.
4. If you do not know the facts which can stop a rumor, ask
the rumor-teller where he got his facts.
5. Don't give a rumor the benefit of any doubt.
