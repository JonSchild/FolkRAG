COMMANDMENT'S OFFICE
ELEVENTH NAVAL DISTRICT
SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA
February 27, 1942

Mr. Arnold Barach,
Campaigns Branch, Division of Information,
Office for Emergency Management,
Washington D.D.

Dear Sir:

Under separate cover, a prospectus of a campaign for "Service in Silence" is being forwarded for you information and possible use in a nationwide campaign,

The prospectus was prepared by Mr. Lee Ringer of Los Angeles for possible use in a campaign in the Eleventh Naval District. So impressed were Lt. Comdr. E. Robert Anderson, District Public Relations Officer, San Diego, and Lt. Comdr. Alfred J. Bolton, Assistant Director Public Relations Officer, Los Angeles, in the thorough preparation of the prospectus that it was deemed advisable to forward it to you with a suggestion that it be considered carefully for the proposed national campaign.

Mr. Ringer has waived all rights of ownership in conjunction with any of the "Serve in Silence" campaign copy, layouts, ideas, etc. He has granted to the Navy and "all persons, firms, corporations, associations, etc., full rights to use my material in any manner approved by the Navy."

If, after a study of the comprehensive document, you do not consider that it meets the requirements for a nationwide campaign, it is earnestly requested that it be returned to this office.

At the present time there is no comprehensive program in behalf of "Serve in Silence" under way in this district. This area certainly will want to cooperate in any nationwide effort and, in case the prospectus which we are forwarding is not used by your office, it will be employed for a localized campaign in the area.

We extend every good wish for success in whatever campaign your office undertakes.

Very truly yours,

Harold Requa, Jr.
Lieutenant (jg) U.S.N.R.
District Public Relations Office
