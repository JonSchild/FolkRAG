I am sorry about the Haitian report. It simply won't come 
out of me fast. But I'll send it along as soon as I can force 
it into existence. I don't know what is the matter with me now, 
but I can't write what I want to. I suppose this will mean my 
expulsion from the Library, but I shall have to bear the disgrace 
as best I can.

Dear Sprivacke,

Thanks for your consolatory letter. It cheered me no 
end and changed my luck, it seems, most decidedly. Last 
Saturday night I found the most delightful old time banjo 
player I have yet met. At 71 he thumps away at his instrument 
and sings about Liza Jane and all the rest with more than the 
enthusiasm of youth. This afternoon the best fiddler I have 
heard in Ky. is coming to play, plus a banjo picker and a singer, 
and an old ballad singer and his two daughters. Tomorrow morning 
at seven thirty, an old fellow is coming who is 
said to be the best ballad singer in this county.

I will need four or five extra days to run about over 
the rest of this section and make records in a few more counties 
so that the trip will seem more like a survey than it does at 
present. I am convinced that a real survey of this large a 
section of the state would take six months at least, unless 
there were a crew of four or five people were working in the 
territory. May I make a formal request, then, 
for four or five days more than my allotted time? That would 
bring me back to Washington sometime between the fifth and the 
eighth of November. Write me General 
Delivery, Pikeville, Ky., whether or not you approve of the idea. 
Please enclose two packages of cutting needles.

Yours, Alan
Alan Lomax
