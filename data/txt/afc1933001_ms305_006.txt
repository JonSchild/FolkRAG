SANG LUMBERJACK SONGS FOR SCHOOL OF THE AIR.  Alan Lomax, folk music expert for Columbia's
American School of the Air, is pictured above in CBS' New York studios with Elmer George, an old-time
lumberjack from Vermont, who sang the songs of his calling as guest of the "Folk Music of America"
series on the School of the Air a few weeks ago.  He is an example of the indigenous talent being presented
in the series by Mr. Lomax.  Lomax will be commentator on the program from WDBJ Tuesday,
presenting the "Bog Trotters" from Galax.

Among The Suggestions
Outstanding among the suggestions
made by the board were the
following three points: 1.  The establishment
of a series of half hour
evening programs dramatizing the
processes of learning.  2.  The establishment
of a series of dramatic
radio portraits employing to the
full the average American's curiosity
as to what his neighbor is
doing in art, business, industry,
research, science, government services,
religion and music.  3.  The
continuous use of evening periods
withdrawn from the commercial
schedule, and definitely reserved for 
experimental broadcasts in the educational
field.

Uncle Alec with an income.
"I never went to school but three
months in my life," says Uncle
Alec, but that doesn't mean Uncle
Alec doesn't keep up with what's
going on and isn't well read.  Last
year he received as a gift a copy
of the complete works of Shakespeare,
which he reads often.  And
he can quote Burns to you by the
hour.  "Did most of my studyin' in
the fields a-watchin' the cows," he
says.

Tuesday.  But, curiously enough, Alan never wanted to [?]
songs.  He wanted to be a philospher.
Deciding Factor
In the summer of 1933, he made
a trip with his father into the field,
in an old jalopy with modern
record-making equipment which 
is the sine qua non of the folk
music expert.  Alan was just along
for the ride, but while in the
little town of Taylor, Texas, the
father and son heard a Negro
woman singing a strangely beautiful
song, entitled "Thank God Almighty, 
I'm Free at Last."  The
young man was so moved by it
that he decided to devote his life
to finding other music like it.  Now
he's assistant to his father at the
Library, and has personal charge
of a collection of 3,500 recordings.
Lomax has had some remarkable
experiences in his search for
folk singing.  Somebody told him
about a Negro piano player who
could sing a score of verses to the
song about the man who killed
Billy Lyons for a milk-white
Stetson hat.  Lomax hunted him
up, and found him in a night
club. They got acquainted, and
one night  Lomax showed up with a 
typewriter and a sheaf of paper.
