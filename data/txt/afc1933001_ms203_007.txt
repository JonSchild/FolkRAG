Dear Alan Lomax:
We are planning on your being with us this coming
weekend -- everyone is extremely pleased. The students
are a swell bunch -- I'm sure you'll enjoy them. 
I've investigated instruments for record playing 
and find there are good ones available, the regular ones
used here at the college. If you have any particular
kind you especially want, drop me a card about it. I
seem to remember that you needed a special type of tone
arm.
The plan at the moment seems to be that you would be
with us Saturday night for whatever the students are doing
then Sunday at most any hour you may choose we would have
singing with you and guitar then later records. That is, 
if this plan meets your approval.
The school is planning on paying expenses. Too bad
we are a worker's school and haven't money to pay as we 
should. But, the appreciation will be here. We are 
planing on housing you and your wife here at the dorm.
Let me know if others are coming with you and we'll see
what we can do. We want Sterling Brown to come but feel
that we should save him for another time. Two stars at
once would be a shower of riches. However, I'm writing 
him to see when it would be best and if he will come. 
Let me know immediately if this plan is not okay.
If Mr. Seegar can come with you do bring him. I'm sorry
we can't offer his expenses, but if you alldrive down maybe
if could be done. Railroad fare is around six dollars and
I'm sure we can't go above ten for the whole thing. 
It will be fine to see you again.
Yours,
Monday  Esther Peterson
Telephone, ASHLAND 4-7867   P. S. I'll drop Mr. Seegar a note inviting him in
248              spite of no more expense money. E.P.
