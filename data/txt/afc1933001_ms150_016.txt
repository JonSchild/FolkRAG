332 West 9th St.
Travers City, Michigan

Dear Mr. Lutman:

Dr. E. C. Beck of Central State Teachers College, has written
me enthusiastically about your manuscripts of meninences. I have
collected a large number of Lumber Jack songs and I have been 
reading everything I could find about the "Good old days". One
of the things I looked for but have not found, is the book of 
just the sort Dr. Beck has told me you have written.

Would you consider lending me your manuscript for two or
three weeks for my own pleasure and information? I could at least
give you some farily good advice at the end of that ti[?]e, as to
how it might be prepared for publication since I have some experience
in that field. Perusal of a book of this sor would make me feel
much more sur of my ground in speaking to the school children of
America about Lumber Jack life and songs, as I shall in the month
of November. I am talking abou  old-time songs over the air for
the Columbia Broadcasting System every Tuesday morning on a program
called the American School of the Air and one of my subjects is
The Songs and Ballards of the Lumberjack. You can feel perfectly
sure that the manuscript will not only be handled with the greatest
of care, if you send it to me, but will also not be used in any
other way unless you y ourself d sired it. I should simply like to
read the biography of a real old-time lumber man to sort of get the
feel of the thing. As you know, most of the books on this subject
are written by outsiders.

At any rate, I should like to hear from you and if possible,
when I come to Michigan next, to visit you with my recording machine.
In the expectation of an early reply, I am

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
