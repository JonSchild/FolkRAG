Wednesday, continued.
I wonder if I will ever find
time to write about anything or
to think about anything but Robin.
This is London. I am 36. There
are adventures & strange turnings at
every hand, but all I have done in
Europe so far is bring here all my
old worries, work difficulties,
masochism, etc..
The car I own prevents me from 
ever touching the earth except [in]
when my feet & legs are [almost
ready to] trembling. The work I 
do prevents me, at least in London,
from talking to ordinary people
about ordinary things. My own
interests in folklore are now so specialized
that I hardly ever have time to
follow them out - my sense of
reaction to songs is so dulled
