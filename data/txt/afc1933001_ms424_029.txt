DRINK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE EYES
(England)

(Page 37 - Old Favorite Songs)


Drink to me only with thine eyes, and I will pledge with mine,
Or leave a kiss within the cup and I'll not ask for wine,
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine,
But might I of Jove's nectar sup
I would not change for thine.


LOVE'S OLD SWEET SONG
(England)

(Page 153 - Old Favorite Songs)


Once in the dear dead days beyond recall
When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng,
Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song;
And in the dusk where fell the fire-light gleam,
Softly it wove itself into our dream.

Refrain: Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go.
Though the road be weary
Sad the way and long
Still to us at twilight
Comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.


SWEET AND LOW
(England)

(Page 129) - Old Favorite Songs)

Sweet and low, sweet and low, wind of the western sea
Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea.
Over the rolling waters go, come from the dying moon and blow,
Blow him again to me, while my little one, while my pretty one sleeps.
