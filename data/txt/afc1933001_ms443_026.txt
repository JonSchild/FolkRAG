page; they really ought to be referred differently; by number
and letter respectively, or some other method. 3). The various
signs not used in our musical practice are explained in my
remarks now. If you think it would be wise to explain each of
them also with a footnote the first time they occur in the music, 
I should enter these footnotes. I am leaving for Europe
on the 9th of July, from New York; will be in New York between
the 7th and the 9th, and will be very glad to look in on
Macmillans and add these details or check on whatever there is
anything to check. You may ley me know what you think about
points 1. 2. and 3.
[*I do so
think and
am telling him*]
   Unfortunately there are still a few things to be sent
in to you which I must do from New Haven where I shall be again 
in a few days. These are: a.)  transcription of 30 Days in
the Workhouse, Mr. Tom Hughe's Town, and another record of
Hoday, Ol' Man Settin' in the Corner Dyin' and Green Corn. Alan
suggested changes in these but I left his letter at New Haven
and must check them against the letter. After these last
details are out of the way, I shall be ready to send the records
wherever you wish to have them.
[*What do say?  
Tell me*]
   I shall be very interested in your Cowboy Cylinders
and very glad to look them over before whenever convenient. I will
be able to look them over before leaving for Europe and to write
you about my findings, suggesting what I'd think might be done
with them. Whatever I can do with them I will be more than glad
to do, in the Fall; will be back in the states beginning of October,
and tackle thme then before thinking of anything else.
[*Thanks
I'll pack
and send
'em on tomorrow,
I hope.*]
   I seem to have taken up all matters of detail and will
take up what I may have forgotten with a less sluggish mind and
a more readable script, on my return to New Haven, sending the
last transcriptions.
