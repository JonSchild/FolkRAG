how many chickens". Said-uh "I know when one is out. When I call 'em an' they 
all don' show up, then I know when they out". Well, you see, I'm the kind-I 
always was the kind of a fella I wanta get the right point of a thing before 
I start, I mean get in a argument or anything like that. So so says-uh, 
"Bill", says-uh, "I'm two chick-two chickens sho't". An' I say, "well", I 
said, "Now", I said, "Which one is gone?" She says-uh "Well, it's-uh two 
of my Domminecker chickens that's gone". I said, "Well, mamma," I said, 
"Wha' you think they're gone", I say, "You think Frank-uh Jim or Dave an' 
Lil (Elijah?) ___ two that stole 'em an' cooked 'em ____?"
She says, "No", says, "Because I give David an' Lij two chickens an' I give 
Frank one". See, they was married, my three brothers. They was married an'-an' 
I would steal 'em as quick as anybody else, you know what I mean, an' they 
would steal 'em too, you know, chickens from my mother. So she said, "I'm 
goin' an' I'm gonna find out wha' the chickens went to". So she lit out. I 
tol' her I says "Well", I says, "you go to Jim's or Frank's-Jim's or Frank's

over an' they found-uh, found-uh, my mother went out an' she went by this 
guy's house, Lucky. An'-uh she foun' the chickens' feathers 'roun' there, see? 
An' this guy, God-dog, he says, he tol' my mother she was a damn liar, that-uh 
he bought them chickens. My mother said she knowed the chickens' feathers.
