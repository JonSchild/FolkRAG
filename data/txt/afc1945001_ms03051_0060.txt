Memphis, Tennessee

Lady who lives near Airport bought stationery and asked if we
had heard Negroes were uprising tonight - 10-5-42. She had
been warned to take her two children and stay closer into town
because she had no guns. Also machine guns had been moved 
to Airport and Army Depot to hold off uprising. Help had been
asked of Nashville for Home Guard. Conversation ended. Don't
let anybody get funny with you.
