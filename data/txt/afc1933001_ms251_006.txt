Dear Alan:

Can't you, plus Mr. Spivacke,
wangle me copies of The Library
of Congress Radio Programs, as
well as the programs issued by the
Pan American Union. Mr. Spivacke
has agreed to lend me permanently
as many as 250 selected copies of
our recordings. The two programs
referred to will be credits on 
that promise. Talk with him
and let me know what you
decide.

Shirley and the children are
here with us, Shirley almost frantic
