BJ:     I jus' didn't want to.  I jus'. . .I'd rather pick, tha's all.
An', ah, an' so, an' so somebody got, got to want to be a grader.
An' sometime they have white an' colored, [an'] there, mixed up together
there grading.   Mens and womens. 
         Well, see, after you grade 'em, then, then you put your, [that] the
head on it, you know, that top on it an' then you wire.  It's 
ready for shippin'. You know, but you, but you don't bring 'em
right off the row.   Because they liable to have bushes in it;
liable to have rocks in it; you ain't supposed to, but on, they,
they liable to be in there. [You have] They got to grade 'em out.  An', 
an' so they. . .
TL:     Well, Bessie...
BJ:      So that when the man come to buy 'em -- the bean buyers come
out to buy 'em -- why, why they know. If not that, why you got
already engagement for so many carloads, of beans.  An' if they
be shipped all the way to New Yawk, an' they not right, they
ship 'em back.   See?  Tha's right. An' so that [way] why ya got to 
have somebody ta, ta grade 'em out an' fix 'em up, ya know,
lak they should be.  It costs a whole lot ta, ta farm.
         An' th-that's why I think it's s-so nice an' so good to
give God praises fer, fer it. 'Cause peoples [that] done work [do] through
something.   I'm tellin' you! You[r] work [do] through something; hit work
 from the bottom to the top, in, in that.
 [*PICKING*]
        An' then, you come out -- jus' like [you,] you workin' down in,
in those rows? Ah, ah sometimes I have got on rows, not one
time, an' never got 'em out yet, today. 
TL:     What?
BJ:     The rows. Be so long an' so full a beans. I have picked 
beans the, the distant (distance) from, from, from here to that
