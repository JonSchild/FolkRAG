October 6, 1942

State: Florida   City: Jacksonville   Reported by: General Salvage Officer
Place or circumstances in which rumor passed: In my office

Rumor: There will be no second front this year owing to the fact that
priorities superior to those given either the Army or Navy have
been accorded the Roebling Amphibian Tank Plant at Dunedin, Florida,
which is engaged in a big contract for landing barges, and sufficient
quantities cannot be delivered to permit an invasion before February.

(This rumor was reported to me by Mr. Codrington who knows my interest
in securing them, and he should not be misunderstood as disseminating
such a matter generally. On the contrary, he is most cautious.)
