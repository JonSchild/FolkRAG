for trial, they are ready to believe the worst of him and
are happy to send him away to the penitentiary.
     In the course of the foregoing story, the reader
has seen how our singer's talent, with 
its concommitants of moodiness, conceit, attraction for women, won 
him the envy and even hatred of Negro men. In addition, however,
Lead Belly had the misfortune to be unusual-looking. Even
the manner of his face and the way of his body made him conspicuous 
among any groups of Negroes. The fact is that Lead Belly is 
a quarter Indian.
     The face speaks tremendous vitality, of magnificent,
almost cruel animal selfishness and will. It is a face that has 
smiled often but laughed little,
a face that has smiled more often at women and at Lead Belly's 
accomplishments than at the strange and comical way of the
world. In this respect, particularly, it is a strange Negro
face. He skin is quite dark - One of those "changeable 
people's who ain' pure Afycan, (some days the Afycan blood will
be runnin' an' we black, an' then some days our mix blook will
be runnin' an' we'll be light color.") his color does seem
to vary from dark brown to an almost purple black. His mouth
is soft and sensitively curving; his cheekbones high and full
his nose aquiline; his haw broad and his chin prominent. A 
quick glance from his eyes is like a glitter of intensely white
light, and this hard watchful flash coming from a face
that is most often withdrawn and cloudd with brooding, startless
and disturbs one. It is the look of a stranger who has come into a
new land among enemies and is alert for each hint
