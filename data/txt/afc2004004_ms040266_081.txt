Dear Sir, 
   I thank you for your letter which I had on my return to College. 
    I am afraid that the large number of records made 
 while I was collecting these in Wales are now too faint for 
much use to be made of them. Only a fortnight ago the B.B.C. 
in a programme about my work recorded for overseas transmission 
tried to use some of these  early records and found that they
were useless. Of course, they were made on phonographs and have 
 had no attention paid to them since they were done some 30 years 
ago. I gather that most collectors of that period have the
 same difficulty and that it is not possible to re-record from
 these very faint impressions. These records are lodged at present
 with Mostyn Lewis, Esq., Westwood, Gresford, Denbighshire, and it
 might be worth your while to discuss possibilities of one or even 
two being used.
   One instance comes to my mind, however, of a Folk 
singer of the present day whose records can be used. His name
 is Robert Roberts and the records are obtainable from the 
Secretary, Welsh Recorded Music Society, Coleg Harlech, Harlech,
 Merionethshire, Wales. I think, too, that Mr. Sam Jones, B.B.C.
 Director, Bangor, would also have a knowledge of present day
 folk singers and would, I am sure, be ready to help you. I 
really wonder whether one hour only for the folk music of three 
countries, each quite distinctive, will not leave a very meagre
 impression of the smaller ones anyway! 
   I have been very interested in hearing your programmes
 and songs. I was particularly interested to hear the Irish one
 sung in a "Woman's Hour" programme  I'll dye my petticoat',
 because I had sung to the Irish Folk Society many years ago a most
 beautiful variant of that same tune. It gave me much pleasure to
 be reminded of the occasion. 
Yours faithfully, 
Dora Hubert Jones
