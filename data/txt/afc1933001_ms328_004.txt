Old Brandy is a cordial I
do not like at all. The landlady's 
measure is growing
very small, fill up this
cup again It will go
round us all. I long to 
be jovial & merry.
(2) Old brandy and whisky
I love you I know. You've
beat me & banged me
& brought me down low.
Both eyes all bunged up
'till I scarcely can go
Never was a boy could
relieve me.
(3) Old Bran - & Whis - you've
led me astray over
hedges & ditches & out of
my way & now you've
got me down & only
gained a day. I'll try
you in the morn. when I'm sober
