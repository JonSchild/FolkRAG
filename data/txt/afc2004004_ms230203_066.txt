I have heard somewhere of a traveler on horseback, who just at eventide, being uncertain of his road, inquired of a person he chanced to meet, the way to Barkhamstead.
"You are in Barkhamstead now," was the reply.
"Yes, but where is the center of the place?"
"It hasn't got any center."
"Well - but direct me to the tavern."
"There ain't any tavern."
"Yes, but the meeting house?"
"Why didn't you ask that afore?  There it is, over the hill."
