Gwine Dig a Hole To Put de Devil In

A square dance, very fast, with the very devil in it. Give the fiddler a
dram and he "don' give a damn" about anything but making the music and the
girls skip swifter. As Lead Belly sings "Don' give a damn, Don' give a damn,"
his face flashes with laughter and defiance to old men, preachers of Hellfire,
and law-makers. In that one line and his way of singing it for dancing
he seems to give away the gay and dangerous spirit of a dance inaa country-side
which believed you could fry in Hell forever and that the singing fiddle was the
Devil's own instrument.
