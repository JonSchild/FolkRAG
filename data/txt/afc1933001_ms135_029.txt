Dear Mr.Lomax:

I am much pleased to learn that you are planning to undertake some recordings of folk tunes and styles in Wisconsin during the present summer.

I have shown your letter to Mrs.Dorothy Moulding Brown who is the folklore authority in our state and has labored in that field for some years. She thinks that we have something for you in lumberjack,Norwegian,Swiss and other songs and fiddlers,key-harp,salmodikon,horn, and other players on rare and old time instruments which you will like to record.

She will be pleased to see you when you come to Wisconsin and to help plan your recording program. Address her at 2011 Chadbourne,Madison.

I will also be pleased to help you. I have seen and talked with Mrs.Robertson.

Sincerely yours,
Charles E. Brown
Director,State Historical Museum
