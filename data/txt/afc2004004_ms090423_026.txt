56.

Albert, Frankie is calling
Albert said, I don't care
If you don't come to this woman you love
They will haul you away from here
He is my man, but he done me wrong

Frankie shot at Albert
She hit him some four or five times
She looked beyond the smoke of her gun
And she saw old Albert Flinging
He is her man, but he done her wrong

Albert got to his mother's house just about 12 o'clock
He said, open the door dear mother
All of your son is shot
I am your son and the youngest one
Albert's mother, she come to the door screaming and crying
She said, look here what that woman done to this darling 
son of mine
He is my son and the youngest one

Albert's mother sent for the doctor
And Abert layed cross the bed
He said, All those bullets in my back
They show is pains me so
I am your son and the youngest one

Turn me over mother, over and over slow
All those bullets in my back
They show is pains me so
So I am your son and the youngest one

Albert's two sisters come running, screaming, and crying
Mother, the doctor told me one hour ago
Brother Albert's dying
He is your son and the youngest one

Rubber tire with buggy
Carry him away with a hack
They carry old Albert to a new graveyard
And see, they ain't brought him back
He was her man, but he is dead and gone

The sheriff 'rested old Frankie
And carried her gainst the courthouse wall
You might heard Frankie say
Judge he done me wrong
