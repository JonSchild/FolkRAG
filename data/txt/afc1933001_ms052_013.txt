Mr. John A. Lomax
c/o Thos. Cook & Sons
2 Place du Madelaine
Paris, France

Dear John Lomax:
It was nice to hear from you. I really
did not expect a letter as I know exactly
how hard it is to write while lolling in
the Italian sun.
There is little new here. Alan just
came back from a successful trip to Indiana,
I just received the appointment as Chief of
the Division, and everybody is working hard.
I have seven concerts to run in the next 
two weeks so I will have to stop now and
thank you for your letter. I hope that you
and your family are having a wonderful time.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely,
HB
mr
