Mr. Edward Weeks
Atlantic Monthly
Arlington Street
Boston, Mass.

Dear Mr. Weeks:

When you were in Texas last year, you expressed some 
interest in my work in collecting folksongs. You volunteered
to suggest that when you got back to Boston you'd think it over
and let me know what phase you might wish to publish in the 
Atlantic Monthly. I have written out a number of incidents
that could easily be used as articles for the book I'm writing, 
Adventures of a Ballad Hunter.

If you'd like for me to send you a few samples for you to 
look over, I will. If you're not in a position to read the
manuscripts now, I'd rather wait until you, yourself, find time. I 
don't have much success with your associates.

Sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax
