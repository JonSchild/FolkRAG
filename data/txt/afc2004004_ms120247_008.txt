over in the fierce and joyous dance of all the Rada Gods. 
(49B2)
Papa Legba, whyen, whyen, m'alle, 
O gens raison, 

(I am) Papa Legba, so-so, so-so*, I walk, 
O, a reasonable fellow. 

This song lasted for perhaps five minutes, but since no 
dancer was possessed of Legba, another was soon begun to call 
him. In Pont Beudet each of the vaudou gods is thus called in three songs. 
First, the Yen Valou, a crouching dance, with slow and dignified 
movements of the shoulders neck and head, serves to 
invoke the god and seems to correspond roughly to 
the first stage of gradual possession. Often, when the 
God is "mounting" the head of a dancer, he or she will stagger 
slightly or, in other cases, hop about on one foot, nearly 
but not quite ever falling, supported by the bodies of the other dancers. 

*Whyen, an onomotopoetic word descriptive of the limping 
pace of lame Papa Legba.
