Barney Martin & his broken feet -

People in Mt. Pleasant -
   Cantankerous bastard - Wixow
torture in Barnum & Bailey's -
rude, [ug] hideous, old, degenerate
teeth gone, upper lip pouched -
making himself into a saint
with his lumberjack picnic
which the [?] now attend
because they want to see the
women [log-b??rlers] from Atlantic
City - the smooth Comstocks -

Bill McBride - proud of his
horny hands, puzzled at his
poverty, a mind that stutters
a fuss buget but a worker
can't stop - the harder it
was the better he loved it -
his first women died &
children left alone - stories
about property - good
money $2000/yr. - his
story of riding the ki-yi
