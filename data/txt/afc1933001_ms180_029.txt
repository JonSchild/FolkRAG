Dear James Baker:
The Archive of American Folk Song is planning
to make up a group of the best representative
American folk songs to be distributed in Latin
America. Among the records we hope to use is
your performance of the "Grey Goose" which you
recorded for John A. Lomax in 1933. We will pay
you $10.00 for the use of this song and we will
send you two copies of the record for yourself.
I hope you will give us your permission to use
this song by signing and returning the enclosed
form as soon as possible. All the records will
carry the legend. "For non-commercial use only"
and, of course, your name will appear on every
record.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
