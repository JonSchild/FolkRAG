Lomax:   Oh, I'm just interested in making notes of songs like that.
I'm from upstate a piece.

Negro:   I saw you copying down the words.  If you'd buy a little drink
for the house I reckon'd I'd tell you how I come by it.

Lomax:   Set 'em up.

Negro:   Ain't so many years ago I was cooking for camps of cowhands
who were out on the round ups - but one time I got a job cooking
for Sam Bass, the outlaw, and his gang - He used to be with
Jesse James.  Ever night when we was in safe enough hiding
ol' Slim would get out his banjo - and one night I come on
him alone just as I was about to turn in.

Fade into Slim playing on banjo - end one song - pick up H O R

Negro:   Where'd ja git that song, cap'n Slim?

Slim:   In jail, up in Colorado - That's the dad-blamedest coldest
country in the world - give me Arizona every time.  They only
had one room in the jail and long about midnight the deputy sheriff
comes clanking up to the cage with a miner and a cowhand manseled
together -

Deputy:   (Sound - opening of cage)  All right outies, didn't reckon you'd 
be sleeping together tonight, now did you.  In you go.

Bus:   Y'aint gonna leave us clamped together like this, are you Cap?

Deputy:   Sure.  Never seen if fail yet when two fellows can't get along.
They either tear each other up or else decide to co-operate.
But if you decide to fight don't make too much noise.  Slim,
over there's takin a long ride tomorrow - on a rail.  He needs
the rest.

Slim:   If I were leaving the north pole I couldn't be happier - Sourpuss.

Silence.
