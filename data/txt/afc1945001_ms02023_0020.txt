October 6, 1942
State: Florida City: Jacksonville Reported by: General Salvage Officer
Place or circumstances in which rumor passed: In my office
Rumor: There will be no second front this year owing to the fact that priorities superior to those given either the Army or Navy have been accorded the Roebling Amphibian Tank Plant at Dunedin, Florida, which is engaged in a big contract for landing barges, and sufficient quantities cannot be delivered to permit an invasion before February.
(This rumor was reported to me by Mr. Codrington who knows my interest in securing them and he should not be misunderstood as disseminating such a matter generally. On the contrary, he is most cautious.)


October 9, 1942
State: Florida City: Jacksonville Reported by: General Observation
Place or circumstances in which rumor passed: Jacksonville
Rumor: Some weeks ago when the Duval County Defense Council arranged a series of test blackouts, rumor was strongly current that the tests were made in order to hide the movement into Jacksonville of 56,000 troops from Camp Blanding and their embarkation here for overseas.
On the night of October 8th another test of approximately one hour duration was held at about 8:00pm, and the troop movement question again has appeared not as a statement of fact but in the form of a question, "I wonder if they are moving troops again?", or as a comment, "They must be carrying out some more troop movements."
