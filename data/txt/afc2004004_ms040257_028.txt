REEL 28
(contd.)
EDINBURGH (contd.)

I rose in the morning
And looked in the glass
And said to myself
What a handsome young lass
My hands by my side
And I gave a ha-ha
For nae bonny laddie will tak' me awa'

We've (come here?)
If you ask a child. . .
You are always discovering new rhymes - that are quite new to
you any way. (?) And if you ask a child "Do you know this,
or that?" they don't remember - it has to come out
quite unconsciously. That is how we found the girls
were skipping. . .That (bumps skips means this then?) the rope passes twice and the girl's
feet are up in the air and when we made this film
the feet were actually in the air. . .
What is the name of that great ballet dancer?
Nijinsky.
And actually she is in the air. What's that Peggy
Peggy: You go up to four times, if you are good. Can't you,
Peggy?
PEGGY: We can do more than four.
Can you?
What is the most you have ever seen then?
PEGGY: You can't keep up very long, but I have seen them up to
seven or eight.
Eh? (LAUGHTER)

No. 19  "I'm a little orphan girl"
I'm a little orphan girl
My mother she is dead
My father is a drunkard
And won't buy me my bread.

I sit upon the window sill
To hear the organ play
And think of my dear mother
Who's dead and far away.
Ding dong. . . .My castle bell
Farewell to my mother
Bury me in the old churchyard
Beside my eldest brother.
