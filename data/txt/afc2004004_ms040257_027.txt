Interview with science teacher on singing games

... One day I had a class.  I am supposed to be a 
science teacher and if you teach certain girls science
it is very difficult.

[LOMAX:  Why?]

Because they are just not interested in science.
They are not interested in scientific explanations about
why a blanket keeps you warm.  They are not interested
in the conductivity of the air.  So I say to them:
Well, tell me what are you interested in, because
I [can't] couldn't get their interest aroused.  And of course,
no answer.  And I say What do you do?.. No answer.
What do you do during the holidays?  We play in the 
street.  What at?  And they talk to me about their
[stark the d?? the & the]
games and this is how they become interested.
[What was the ^ first one you got ?]

[I am not the least bit methodical.]
These rhymes skip, you see.  or they [have a ball] play with a ball.
There are hundreds of counting out rhymes.

Etal, otal, Black Bottle....

Peggy;
There are hundreds of these, aren't there, Peggy?
What is your favorite counting out rhyme, Peggy?
Well, the one that was most popular was about Mabel
the horse.  This is a good one.

"Three white horses in the stable
Pick one out and call it Mabel
If it's Mabel set the table
Three white horses in the stable.
LAUGHTER AD LIB
(ELIMINATE)

If you are a school-teacher, you really have great 
advantages over other people...  You have all these
children...  they are at your disposal... slaves...
well, I wouldn't say slaves - NO - but you can pursuade
them to do it.  They will do it.

My age is sixteen
My father's a farmer
In yonder green
He has plenty of money
To dress me in silk
And ae bonny laddie will tak' me a [awa'] a walk.
