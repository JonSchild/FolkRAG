LUDERIN
Fais do-do meant sleep.  Fais means "make", "make sleep" in
other words, direct translation, you see.
EDWIN
And they was all breast babies.
LUDERIN
The ladies would pat the babies and say "fais do-do, now,
fais do-do"
EDWIN
Oh yeah.  So she could go dance.
LUDERIN
They wouldn't say "now", "fais do-do. . ." and something like
that.
EDWIN
Yeah, "fais do-do", and they'd go ahead and put 'em in their
room and go out there in that crowded room and once in a 
while you could see the mother leaving, go out there and
check the room and see if their baby cryin'.  But they went
for those dances, let me tell you something.  People, they'd
pack those places.
LUDERIN
Everybody would go to the same dance in those days.  Young,
old, middle aged, on Saturday night.  That was the only place
to go.
RAMBLER
Well, it was really their only form of recreation besides
the horse races on Sunday, you see.  Saturday night was the
night where everybody would get together.
A. LOMAX
And they used to love to fight at those dances too, didn't
they.
RAMBLER
Well, we always made jokes about this, but we'd say that on
Saturday evening they'd be there sharpening their knives
