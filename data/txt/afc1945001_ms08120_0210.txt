a little Sailor says to her
"I bet you can't look me
straight in the eye and say
you have been true to me."

A soldier was on his furlough
and he was over to his girl
friends house so the girls
father was leaving the
room with his paper
(where he had been sitting  before
he got sleepy) and on his way
out he says "Remember no back
outs." (and beside them was a
light burning real bright.)
