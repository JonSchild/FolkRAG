[*Trouble So Hard, etc. 
The New Burying Ground.*]

Anyone who has visited a rural Negro church where the 
[people] congregation sings out of their hearts instead of 
from hymn-books[,] cannot fail to have been touched by the 
fire, the solemn dignity, the grand simplicity of the Negro
spiritual.  [The song usually begins] One of the elders of the 
congregation, on old man or woman [whith] whose long experience
in the church enables tham to match their song precisely to 
the temper of the meeting, will begin the song slowly.  The 
congregation responds with a faint chorus. The leader sings
her line again, this time more strongly.  [The congregation] This 
[tiem] time the response is stronger. By the end of the first or or second
chorus, the spiritual will have gathered together all the voices of the 
church into a swelling and rolling chorus. Each participant takes
his own part from [fsl] shrillest falsetto to deepest bass and improvises within it.  As the songs proceeds,
sometimes for hours on end, the rhythm of hands and feet joins
the thunder of the [chorus] singing with a thunder of a chorus of drums;
the tempo increases slowly and inevitably, until the [building]
whole audience sways [swayed] with ecstasy.  [Suddenly] The air 
is punctuated with the shrill screams and the hoarse  ejaculations
of the worshipers who have [become been overcome] become possessed,
or, as the put it, ["]  "got happy."  [These hysterical] The possessed 
ones leap and fling their arms about in blind   spasms of hysteria,;
they sometimes roll on the floor or walk on the backs of the benches ; 
[occasionally] on occasion they lie on the ground for hours in a [cataleptic] 
trance1/2like state.
