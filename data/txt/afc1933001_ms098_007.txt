Dear Mr. Lomax

     I have listened to the talking on the recordings
of Harriet McClintock and Billy Macree. Aunt Hattie is 
quite clear and her talk has been copied on a single
12-inch disk, which I am sending you under separate cover.
Uncle Billy, on the other hand, is not always clear or
coherent, and I hesitate to make any selection without 
your further advice as to subject and amount, if any.
These are the subjects:

     1. The naming of his 35 children
     2. His first deer hunt, possum
     3. Dog speck
     4. Slavery days
     5. Log-rolling

     In his case, the talk is even more closely connected
with the songs and the two would be hard to separate. My
own feeling is that unless you are particularly interested
in Uncle Billy, he says very little of importance or interest.

          With best wishes,

                                                         Faithfully,

                                                         B. A. Botkin
                                                         Assistant in Charge
