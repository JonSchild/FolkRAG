THERE'S A BATTLE AHEAD
Tune--It's A Long, Long, Trail A Winding.
There's a long, long battle coming,
Before we win our desire,
But we have to make the grade, boys,
'Tis no time to tire.
We must stop the speculator,
And his gambling pits, too,
And bring about prosperity
To cheer these hearts so blue.

There's a long, long struggle coming,
But we'll never give in,
Out fight is right, our goal is good,
We're sure to win.
We must buy and sell together
And vote for control,
To crush the power of Wall Street down,
And save out lives and soul.

NEVER GIVE UP
Tune--Juanita.
Oft in the evening. when I meditate along,
Comes a glad promise, of a victory soon;
Then I smile with visions
Of our farm homes safe and glad,
And renew decisions
For my comrades sad.

Chorus--
Union, F--E--C--Union,
Never give up, hold thy own,
Union, F--E--C--Union,
You shall claim your crown.

When in the distant, by-gone struggles rise again,
Lives so consistant, seem to live again.
What an heritage wondrous
Comes to bless our fevered brow.
With courageous fondness
We renew our vow.
