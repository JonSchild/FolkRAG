3. From Drew, Miss., on yesterday
I [mailed] expressed you a second batch
of records. Please find enclosed
receipt.

We are finding some new
stuff and re-recording some
of the best of the old. The gang
work songs, sung in wild abandon,
seem definitely gone. I
can't find in anymore after
only [5] 2 years. And the old
spiruals are following: Chief
causes, I think, the radio and
education. Thank you again
for your helpful promptness
and unfailing kindness.

Always sincerely, John A. Lomax
