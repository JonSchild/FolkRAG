Mr. Kaiser:
Public opinion- little expression.
1-Continued dissatisfaction over the rubber situation as revealed by Fulton Lewis Jr. Several have stated having written protests.
Objection to the appearance of the [C]ommunist party on the California ballot.
3- Impatience over the submarine situation- "Why don't we do something"?

The article by Mowrer in the July ALA bulletin, just arrived, looks good.
