perhaps catch a glimpse of John. I never get to go northward anymore except to Virginia by that quick P.O.route.

Your last paragraph is the one I don't approve. Clever yes - humorous, yes - in fact I hope it's all humor. 

Otherwise it (suggests) that you are no mind-reader.

And if you are not, then you do not know with what regrets - for my own self, not for your sakes, I left home years ago to keep an engagement, when I'd so much rather have stayed and had a visit.

Regards to a new friend, your wife, and a friend of long years, yourself. 

Yours,

Helen S.
