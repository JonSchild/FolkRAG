BJ TAPE 15, p. 62

I call it a flatter to me, ya know?  "Dis don' do it.  Git up or go
home or do sumpin'."  I don't be jokin' either.
     'Cause now I'm so thankful that I did it.  An' then I did it
'cause I meant it.  I wasn' thinkin' 'bout it, 'bout I might not to the
next day.  But I jes' didn' mean for 'em to come in an' do me like
that, ya see?  I jes' didn' -- I ain't never liked it, nohow.  An',
now, how happy I am.  See.  Ain't a child can say, "Mama I seed
nothin' aboutcha."  Nothin'.
     An' one goin' an' comin', tha's all.  An' they, an' givin'
'em they money, let them have a good time.  You know, you know, like
goin' to the pitchur show, go out to the chillun's ball game, or
anything like that.  An', but, um, sit down, an' they, an' have
a card game, you know, settin' down to, playin' cards?  "Please,"
said, "Don't git to happy an' go to cussin'."  See?  "In my
house.  Or do, ya have to git out."  An' I meant that, see?  An' so,
that's it.
(INTRAS VS. EXTRA-MARITAL RELATIONS)
     Ain't none of 'em can tell you that today, anywhere behind
my back or anywhere you go see 'em.  An' so I liked -- I jus'
liked that.  So that's th' way womens should do theyselves if they
got to be nasty.  Man should do hisself if he got to be nasty.  You
know?  Don't let -- you know.  Don't, don't, don't disown your own
things, see?  Your own things.  Say, "Look out for your own house."
It say, "Man that don't provide for his own house is worse than
a infidel."  Ya see?  An', an' tha's a woman, too. . .If you don't
provide for your own house, you're worse than a infidel. . .'Cause
that woman is dependin' on you.  An' you dependin' on that woman.
