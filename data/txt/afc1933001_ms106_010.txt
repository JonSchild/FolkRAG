Yes!  Who left me the Valentine?
It was Bessie Brown, a pupil of mine.
She's very talented and bright
She play's her scales both many
   and light
Legata, staccato -- it is a sight!
And does her practice always
   right.
She comes with her mother
   rain or shine
To her lesson on Saturdays
   Half past nine.
To my little friend and pupil
   Bessie Brown Lomax
