Cox: Well, nothing. My father didn't get enough when they made
it up at Chritmas time hardly to get home.  An' there weren't
no train ran; had to walk home.  He never made nothing.  Now they
go and take a hundred or two pound, two or three hundred some
of them. They took a couple of hundred income tax off a skipper
there the other year.  What he had to take - he must have had
thosands, I think 1/2
Lomax: Well, didn't they get any salary?
Cox: Not until they was home. Yes, they got a little spending
money.  They never earnt nothing. Weather'd blow 'em about, it'd
blow 'em about, perhaps a week to get anywhere, with sails.
Sometimes blows away a fortnight.  Blowin' away there hard, an'
then they had to get back to Yarmouth.  Now with this here steam,
off you go; you sail out of the harbour - back again.
Lomax: Did your father like his life as a sailor?
Cox: Well, he never (mumble)
lomax: Did he like it, ot did he just go because he had to?
Cox: No, he didn'r do it because he was forcec to do it.  He took
delight in that. He never did say he didn't like it. Never did
hear him say so.  He went as a boy - well, he never went as a
boy - when he was a young man, he went, an' he never ....they
never come into Yarmouth harbout, bnot till Christmas time.  When
he first went there was no running away.  He had to stop there.
They used to take the fsh out and ferry them into the harbour,
and she lay outside.  Then off they'd go again.  He never came
home.  That's how it was then.  That was the life.  I've heard him
say he'd been standing there - h3 used to be standing there
with eyes full of salt water, all open - just nowhere to get,
you know.  You had to take it.  Bob down.  Proof! A ton of water
over top o' it.  Smothered head to foot --- that was the life then.
