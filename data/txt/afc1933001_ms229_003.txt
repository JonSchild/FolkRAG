which you plan to use. You might
as well mail me at the same
time all the music for the 
unused songs. I paid some
good money for it, though of
course I shall not publish any of it
without arrangement with you
and Mrs. Sugar. Please keep
this note by you until you
can forward me the material
requested.

I hope you can continue
to live in the country. I fear the
winter season will present
difficult problems.

Affectionately always,
Father

P.S. I warn you now that unless you
can find time to write me a new chapter
for my book, I'll use the Southwest Funeral story.
