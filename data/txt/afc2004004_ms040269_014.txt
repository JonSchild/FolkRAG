I took his name & address
& copied out the other 3
verses.

Per Lloyd, once gave
2nd place to this in a
folk song competition to a
fellow that hears this bloke
sing it in a pub. The
fact was that he took
it down wrongly. & called
it "The Banks of The Dee"
I'd discarded it for this
reason but the bloke that
sang it to me put us all
right.

It's the "Banks of the
Deerness".  The Deerness is
a tributary of the River Wear
and in its valley are
some of Durham's oldest pits
Esh- Waterhouses- and Ushaw.
