goin' to make him pay so much money. An' the old lady told her
husband what she was goin' to do. He used to go there; an' when he
got there she said, "You got to put a shovelful of coal on, see,
the fire. They want to catch him - at his house. Put a shovelful
of coal on the fire so the smoke went up all
black. Course, the old fellow went again, as usual she
                                             soon as he see the smoke go
up the chimney, see he catch the old fellow there.
And course that cured him of it.
Lomax: And they made him pay up a good deal. . . .?
Cox: Whey, he wouldn't be against payin'. He won't want his
own people, his wife an' that to know we went anywhere else. Pay
up an' let that go. They said, "We'll catch him." Put the
coal on, you know, an' as soon as the old fellow see the smoke
go up, poppin' out there, he went home. He didn't know - the old
farmer didn't know that. Course not, he wouldn't ha' been
trapped like that. He want to catch him, he had to catch
him, you see first. He can't do no - word of mouth ain't
no use. You got to catch 'em before you can do anything.
Lomax: And he really got him, did he?
Cox: He got him; he was there at his house when he got there.
Course he could set a fine on him, what he liked. Oh, he'd pay;
course he would. (pause)
Lomax: And no more was said about it, eh?
Cox: O' course not. They dropped that then.
Lomax: How much did he make him pay, do you know?
