to see some a his hosses, ah, had done got out [an'] in another
pasture, in another way?   An' they killed. [two of 'em.]   Killed two
of his hosses.  So they had a mess a that thing!   He did it because
he jes' took them people up there, that's all.   Just wanted to git
in a fuss with 'im.   Just want to get in a row with 'im, you see.
So they, so they cut the pasture off that they had.  There was
two brother-in-laws, the pastures almost joined.  Got into that
brother-in-law's pasture an' the hosses musta got to fightin' of
sumpin', anyhow, one of 'em got on out.   He knew that was them.
They marked, all of 'em branded, ya know?    An' so he knowed
that was them.   An' he killed that. . .An' say that, that man
killed. . .he could see. . .
AL:     You mean one of the white men killed the other man's [hours]
horse?
BJ:      Oth-other white man's hoss, 'cause he's the one that got his
hands off a the place, you know?   Jus' didn' like 'im; jus'
