5) Soon the old love arrived and the maiden was gone,
So he sighed very deeply, he sighed all alone.
"She's away with another before off with me,
So goodbye, you green bushes forever," said he.

6) "I'll just be a schoolboy, I'll frolic and play,
No false-hearted maiden will trouble my day,
Untroubled at night I'll just slumber and snore,
So goodbye, you green bushes, I'll go courting no more."

The Broken Token:
1) A young maid stood in her father's garden,
Looking at roses all covered with dew,
When up came a sailor and stood beside her,
And said, "Fair lady, can I marry you?"

2) "It's seven long years, sir, that I've had a sweetheart,
And seven more. he's been at sea,
But seven more I'll wait upon him,
And if he's alive he'll come home to me."

3) "Sure, if he's sick, I wish him better,
Sure, if he's dead, I wish him rest.
If he's alive, I'll wait upon him,
For he is the young man I love the best.

4) He put his hand into his pocket,
His sinewy fingers were slim and small,
And up between them he pulled out a gold ring,
And when she saw it, down she did fall.

5) So he picked her up and sweetly he kissed her,
Yes, he embraced her so tenderly.
Saying, "I am your true and loving sailor, 
And have come home from sea to marry thee."

The Sweet Brown Knowe:
1) Oh come all ye lads and lasses now and listen to me a while,
And I'll sing to you a verse or two to cause ye all to smile,
It's all about a young boy and the story I'll tell ye now,
That lately came to be courting the maid of the Sweet brown know.

2) "O?" says he, "My pretty fair maid, and you come away with me,
We'll both go off together, love, and married we will be.
We'll join our hands in wedlock bands - are ye listening to me now,
I'll do best forever for the lass of the sweet brown knowe.
