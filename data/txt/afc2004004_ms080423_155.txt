and, uh, wanted, you know, to see 'em, you know. . .
so I waited 'til they got back up there, and let the calf git done
sucklin', and they was amilkin', you know, and so I come up behind
'em, you know, you had to kinda slip up on 'em.  And when I come up
behind 'em, the youngest one she just dashed what milk she had
on my face and all, and they run to the house.  And this foam, you
know, you know how, when you milk a cow, this foam would, and it
just covered me up, you know, and so I had to go back home, had
to go back and change clothes, you know before I could go back to
see 'er.  But they would run maybe a half a day before you'd
catch 'em, you know.  Maybe if you catch 'em you'd   tame
'em up, and it's all right, you know.  But that's the way we got
hooked up and started, you know--
AL:  You had to run your girls down?
SH:  Yeah, you had to run 'em down
HP:  . . . .                                   run me down . . .
and so they wouldn't catch me.  I'd hide under the floor of this
great big old high porch, you know, the boys would come, I'd hide
under there . . .                                    and then I'd kill 'em if they
told where I was at.  We just had one door and I couldn't get back in
without goin' before(?) all the boys, and I'd stay on the floor
until they left about midnight. . .                            and say, "where's
Hattie at?"  Stanley and . . .             would say, "I don't know where
she's at."  . . .                                                 "If you tell I'll kill . . ."
I was about 17 year old . . .
