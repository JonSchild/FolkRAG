Jean: She would take any man.  She'd been already taking men.  That's
why....
Lomax: I can't understand what that has to do with her walk.  Do you
Jean: Oh yea.
Lomax: It affects a woman's walk? She can't walk straight?
Jean: Oh yes, it she's been... When she's too liberal with men -
she turns like that.  I've seen 'em like that thousands of times.
Lomax: She wasn't a prostitute then?
Jean: Yes - that's what she was.
Lomax: Or just promiscuous?
Jean: No she must have been a prostitute.
Lomax: Jeannie, is it your opinion thst in Scotland among the
women you know, that women have as much pleasure in sex and making
love as men do - or is it more or less?  I ask this because the
opinion varies in different parts of the world.  For instance, in
France, everybody believes that women have more pleasure in sex
than men do - a lot more.  What's the idea in - what do your friends
think?
Jean: Well, to tell you God's truth, I never carried on a conversation
of that kind.  Never spoke of such a thing.
Lomax: Well, do you think women have pleasure in sex, or is it
something they just put up with?
Jean: I suppse there's a certain amount of pleasure.
Lomax: In the songs it seems that the men are having all the pleasure
Jean: Oh no. I suppose a woman would have as much pleasure as a man
or else she wouldna ask for it.  You're making me feel shy.
Lomax: Naturally it's a shy subject - but it's important to
understand because it's not the same everywhere.  Some parts of
the world women have no, pleasure in sex at all.
Jean: I thought it would be the same all over.
Lomax: No, it's not. I mean when you were a girl growing up in
your particular group among the young girls, was sex ever
discussed as such?
Jean: Never discussed.  I suppose you wouldna beleive it,
but it's correct.  We'd never discuss such a thing.  Never mentioned
about making love, or men, or nothing else.
Lomax: And your mother she never edplained to you?
Jean: No.
