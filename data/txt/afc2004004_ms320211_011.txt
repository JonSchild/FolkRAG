AL ROSE    -10

ROSE           Yes.  Of course that goes back to
days that I don't remember, like when [Stale] bread and
[Razzy Dazzy Spasm] Band were playing in the district.  But
even when I was a kid there were plenty of, of kid bands
playing in the French Quarter.

LOMAX          Because the, and all those things
that Jolly sang me and then, and Buddy [Boldin] songs.   And
then I gather that, that a lot of these creole songs had,
had a double meaning.

ROSE             Oh, they weren't that  subtle for
the most part.

LOMAX          [UNCLEAR]

ROSE              They were out, they were outright
obscene songs.

LOMAX          The first New Orleans song I ever
heard was [FRENCH SINGING]

ROSE             Yeah.

LOMAX          You ever hear that?

ROSE  Sure.

LOMAX          I [UNCLEAR] from an old [UNCLEAR]
the first time I ever came here.

ROSE             But they used to sing them here in
English, you know.  And, and they sound much more obscene in
English.   [LAUGHS]   As a matter of fact, there's a , there's
a certain character to American English obscenity that 
doesn't occur in any other language.   So those were mainly
the lyrics that, that you would hear.
