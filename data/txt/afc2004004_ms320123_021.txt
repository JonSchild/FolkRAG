That makes it an African orchestra.  In Europe, the kind of
orchestra you had is a fiddle in the lead and a wind
instrument like the accordion, right?  So, the difference
between the two orchestras is first of all the accordion
with iron and feet with the rhythm in the back in
polyrhythm, you heard the polyrhythm there with the feet of
Mr. Fontenot playing on the floor.  And we had Black
accordion player- you hear all that hot rhythm on the
triangle. Don't you?
CANRAY
That's right.

And then the  transition to Cajun music was the fiddle takes
the lead and the accordion plays the accompaniment.  Right?
CANRAY
And I remember a young fellow. . .They had this guy from
Reims, Sidney Babineaux.  He came out and everybody was
surprised when he got. . .they used to have some dance hall in
Elton.  For Fourth of July they had Sidney Babineaux.
Everybody was so curious about seeing this man.
A. LOMAX
Was he black or white?
CANRAY
He was black.  He was black.  He would play one of them
triple note accordion.  And he got by, he had a guitar
player, and he was talking about, you know, about the old
French people there.  "Oh yeah, there gonna have a band from
Reims" and then he came.  It was Sidney Babineaux, he had a 
guitar player and then he had somebody with a rubbing board.
Boy, that old rub board-nobody had never seen that, you
know, and they was calling that a big band coming there for
the Fourth of July.  I remember that like it happened
yesterday.

Didn't need any microphones or amplifiers. . .
