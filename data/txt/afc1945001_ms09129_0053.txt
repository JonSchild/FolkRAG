A. Once upon a time Hitler and one of his guards
went out for a ride. They were riding along
when all of a sudden they came upon a dead
dog. Hitler told the guard to go to the house
and tell the people about it so guard went
to the house and he said "Heil Hitler! the dog
is dead and then the people began to cheer.
When the guard went back to the car Hitler
asked him what the cheering was for and what
the guard had said and the guard told him that all he said
was "Heil Hitler! the dog is dead." It seems the
people thought Hitler was dead.
