New bawn, new b-a-w-n
New bawn child, new bawn chil'
Like a lil babe in de manger
e ole ribber Jordan was might deep
But [?] was so sweet

By the time the service was over the sun's rays no longer
reached the bottom of the gorge.  The quiet evening fell, a breeze
came up and stirred the branches of the fragrant cedars.  The crowd
seemed awed by the influence of a most sacred and solemn ceremony,
the effect of which had been intensified, now and then, bu the shrill
voices of the women in shouts of religious ecstacy,  The baptized per-
sons stood around with the crowd grouped about them as the old minister
with hands outstretched to heaven envoked a benediction, and then again
they sang, in a minor key, wonderfully sweet and touching:

De old ribber Jordan was so deep
An' now our brother in Christ we greet;
De old ribber Jordan was so deep
But 'ligion was so sweet.
He said baptism it must be,
If he from sin'll set us free,
An' all things here obey his will,
Spoke to de sea and de sea was still,
For 'ligion was so sweet.

Then the shadows deepened while, with occasional shouts of joy,
the crowd trooped away, and the baptizing was over.  Yet not quite, for
from far down the gorge came floating back to me the song:

De Lord, do Lord,
Do remember me,
