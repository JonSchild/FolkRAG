Ti Cousin
      Chavila and I found him in his slippers
in one of his fine houses. A huge man - 6' 4"
and massive to match. He seems the most
powerful creature & one of the most kingly
men I have ever seen. A deep voice a
head with a flat back, huge jaw, quiet
& completely sure of himself. He speaks more
freely about vauduo than any haitian I have
ever met. Us he treated tolerantly.
We went the round of his houses
