The Marines:
The Marines had a tough time at Wake Island. When the Japs tried to take their convoy around Wake Island, it was just too bad. "One day a Marine was out on his post, and sighted a Jap merchant ship. In less than ten minutes the Marines blasted the ship to bits. "A day or two later, a Jap convoy was sighted right off the coast of Wake Island. Just as it was sighted, the call for chow had been announced. Chow means dinner. The boys were so hungry that they took meals to the shore, and started to blast away. The Japs tried to take "Wake" just as they tried to take Guadanal-Canal and the Soloms Islands. But the Marines was just a little too tough for them. So the Japs had to wait until morning. They fought.
