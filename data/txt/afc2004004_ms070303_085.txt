She says that she has always sung
to every kind of work - but not
special songs - just slowed down
the songs to each task.

Miss Johnstone singing &
churning - she rams to dasher
Come, butter, come,
Butter to the elbows & butter to the wrist #

Everyday joy & no day sorrow
to you!

Bless you we could go on for
Ropes of them - coils of them now

Father John in radio studio big toes
he's going to slow tune expressly

My boy, the one who
made time made plenty 
of it
