THE BIGGEST THING THAT MAN HAS EVER DONE
Tune: Rambling Wreck from Georgia Tech.

I'm just a lonesome traveler, the great historical bum,
I'm highly educated, from history I have come.
I built the Rock of Ages, 'twas in the year of one;
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. (2)

I worked in the Garden of Eden, that was the year of two,
Joined the Apple-Pickers' Union, I always paid my dues;
I'm the man that signed the contract to raise the rising sun,
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. (2)

I was in the revolution when we set the country free; 
Me and a couple of Indians that dumped the Boston Tea;
We won the battle at Valley Forge, and Battle of Bully Run;
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. (2)

There's warehouse boys and teamsters, and guys that skin the cats,
Guys that run the steel mills, the furnace and the blast,
We'll stop the Axis rattlesnakes, and thieves of old Nippon,
And that will be the biggest thing that man has ever done. (2)

There's a man across the ocean, I guess you know him well,
His name is Adolph Hitler, God damn his soul to hell;
I'll kick him in the panzers, I'll put him on the run,
And that will be the biggest thing that man has ever done. (2)

I'd better quit my talking 'cause i told you all I know,
But please remember, pardner, wherever you may go; 
The world is digging the Fascists' grave, and when the job is done,
That'll be the biggest thing that man has ever done! (2)
