THE SINKING OF THE REUBEN JAMES

Have you heard of the ship called the good Reuben James,
Manned by hard-fighting men both of honor and fame;
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea.

Chorus: Tell me, what were their names?
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
(repeat)

One hundred men were drowned in that dark watery grave,
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved;
'Twas the last day of October that we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters by the cold Iceland shore.

(chorus)

It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the U-boats and waited for the fight;
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared,
And they laid the Reuben James on the cold ocean floor.

(chorus)

Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright,
In the farms and the cities they are telling of the fight;
And now our mighty battleships will sail the bounding main
And remember the name of the good Reuben James.

(chorus)
