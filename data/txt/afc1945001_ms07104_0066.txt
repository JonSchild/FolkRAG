There will be no second front
until Russia is virtually on her
knees because then both Russia's &
Germany's forces will be greatly depleted,
and the United Nations won't have to
worry about any demands Russia
may make.

The people want a second front
in Russia, but the leaders don't.

England and the United States are
holding back until the Germans thin out
the Russians and the Russians thin out
the Germans.
