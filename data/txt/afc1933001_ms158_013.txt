Dear Alan:

I think we can settle all of the outstanding problems without too much trouble on Monday.....and by "bright and early", I hope you mean about 10 A.M. As far as our giving you a guarantee for 13 weeks next year is concerned, there should be no difficulty about that (I just called Levine, and he agrees). I'm not too happy about your not wanting to sing on the symphony programs; but that is not a major obstacle.

The only question I can find in your previous letter is the one about clearing the folk songs with your father. I have been on Schimek's neck for the past two weeks in an effort to get the problem solved; and we are still considering all of the alternatives you mention. If your father is not unreasonable (from our point of view !) I would like to do one of two things: either buy blanket rights to,say a maximum of 50 songs for this particular series; or buy general performing rights for all programs over a period of two or three years. This latter idea is predicated on the theory that we will have a folk group like the one that Dave Taylor has been working on.....and the refor have need of lots of material. (I just called Dave, who says the hill-billy idea is out for now, because he couldn't find the right group.)

See you Monday when I'm not in such a rush.

My best to your Boss and Nick,

Bill [?]
