Dear Father:
Dr. Spivacke agrees with my notion that you should go 
ahead and work until the money allocated for your travelling 
expenses, i.e. $150, has been exhausted. In the meantime, 
I shall submit a memo asking that a portion of the funds allocated 
to the Mrs. Tartt trip be transferred to your budget 
and that the  remainder be held until next spring. When 
Mrs.Tartt can do the work. We will see then how matters 
stand. I have written to Mrs.Tartt to this effect. It 
certainly is too bad that the project has come to a stop.
Dr. Spivacke urged me ask you to, for one thing, record
your complete repertory of songs for the Archive, and to take 
your time to make these good records.  If you have any 
notion where some good cowboy songs could be recorded for the 
collection, that would perhaps be one more addition.  As you 
know, our cowboy collection is very scattered.
I think Macmillan's attitude in regard to the royalty is 
pretty cheesy, because the book is about half the size of the 
first American Ballads volume.  The first copy came to me a 
couple of days ago, and I shot it on up to Archiv.  It's a 
beautiful book, and it looks like Ruth won nearly all of her 
arguments, but it certainly isn't $6.00 or even $5.00 worth
of book  It's going to hurt sales very much, I'd say.
It's still not clear whether or not I'm going to South 
America, because so many things are developing here in 
Washington which seem very interesting.  Keep me informed of 
your address, because I want to let you know as soon as I get 
word myself about whether there will be any additional money
available.
Much love to you and Deanie,
Alan
