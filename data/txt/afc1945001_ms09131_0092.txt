[*White]
Den[n]ison  College

This is a rather "social"
small college- Coed. Strong 
fraternity groups, etc., prides
itself on swank. A little bit
on the "upward mobile" side
-parvenues, Sons whose parents 
would like to send them to 
Princeton but can't quite afford it.
Note in this group the first
concentration of Anti-Semitism, 
[If analyzed] I think you'd find 
85% anti-New Deal sentiment
in this college. Fairly able 
faculty but academic standards
tend to reflect the society atmosphere.
