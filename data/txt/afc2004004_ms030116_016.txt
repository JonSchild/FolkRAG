     People that don't know what they're doin, they puts em in a Sane 
Sylum. Those kina people needs to be pitied. (He weeps. Wipes his nose 
on back of hand)
     What makes ouwahselves live longer is to keep our tongues still. 
St. James took it up, "Tongue was a small member but an unruly member.
Sets upon the cotes of nations, hangs upon the hinges of hell. Never 
have been tamed. Behold we put bits in horses' mouths, an turn em from 
one side to another an conquer them, but Man's tongue 
never have been tamed." 
     One man guide a ship guardless of how large it is, but man's tongue 
have never been mastered. 
     David said, "Hold your peace even unto the truth."
     Paul said, "All things are lawful, but not expediently."
     Take your time. See whether it would be deathly. Whether it would tie 
your friends up. Take your time befo you speak.
     Now you take the Welfare. Go down to apply for help. You have to give 
what reasons would be acceptable to the case worker. 
     We haaaaaaaaave to study in this liiiiiiiiiife what would give 
satisfaction. You ask fur a loan of nine hundred dollars. They at the 
bank gon ast you questions. An they also gon to find out whether 
what you have told them is the truth. An that ain't enough. Befo you can 
git the money, the Boss Man have to intercede fur you. You don't live 
along. 
     Traps is set fur you. 
     Every hungry varmint rabbit or possum finds somethin on the trap. 
But if he ain't much interested he ain't gon git caught. 
     Talk about people who don't have jobs an you barely got one 
yosef. Boss Man heah you been talkin so much, he let you go. You be on 
the street yosef. (He laughs)
