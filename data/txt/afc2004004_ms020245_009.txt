[*31*]

ALL OF MY SIN BEEN TAKEN AWAY

All of my sin
Been taken away,
All of my sin
Been taken away,
All of my sin been taken away,
Oh, glory, praise the name,
All of my sin
Been taken away,
Taken away.

If I had a [dime] died
When I was young,
If I had a dime
When I was young,
If I had a dime when I was young
Never would have had this restaurant, 
All of my sin
Been taken away,
Taken away.

Oh, Satan's like
A snake in the grass, etc.
Always know some Christians pass, etc.

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE)

Oh, just about the time
I thought I was lost, etc.
My danger shook and my chains fell off, etc.

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE)

Sister Mary, woe,
Three links of chain, etc.
Every link was Jesus' name, etc.

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE)

Oh, Satan wears
Them slippery shoes, etc.
You don't mind his slippin' on you, etc.

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE)
