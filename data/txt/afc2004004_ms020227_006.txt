BJ TAPE 12, p. 4

An' ah, an' ah, an' they was in the back a the thing, tied to the
back a that lil' thing on the buggy? An' ah, they, that mule
back up there in them harnesses thing, them strops, them, um, 
things come to poppin'. Cause he was gonna make his jump, ya 
know. John knew his -- An' Lewis was tryin' to hol' him. Tryin'
ta, "Whoa, whoa." He done turnt crossways, ya know? An', boy,
he was natchully scared. An, I didn' kno nothin' 'bout no mules.
An', an' he ah, and he, an' some white peoples all come
runnin' to the door an' they see it was turrible, sumpin' was
gonna happen. An' ah, that time, ah, Lewis an' John -- Lewis
tol' John to catch, to hold 'im -- "Catch 'im, John, catch 'im!"
     When John, Lewis, when Lewis -- John stepped outa the buggy,
to ketch the mule, I said, "Catch me!" Boy, I'll never forgit that.
'Cause I was leapin' on across outa that thing. See, the wheel
had done chocked up in there; hada jump over on top a that wheel,
ya know? I said, "Catch me." An' I -- But he didn't; I hit the
groun'. An' ah, the white peoples run out; they thought that I
was hurt -- out the store. I wasn't hurt. I tell 'em, "No, I
ain't hurt." They jus' kep' on. They breshed me off an' looked
at me; thought I was hurt. I wasn't hurt a bit.
But it tore that--all them harnesses. You know, them
stares -- shavs (shafts, she means?) that go down? Broke
'em up. But that way they had nobody, no, no way to git home,
you see? An' so I, I, I don' know jus' how that they got there.
I guess they caught rides somewhere or other. But I know they
left the tubs an' things there at a, ah, friend a mine there in,
in, in Fitzgerald.
