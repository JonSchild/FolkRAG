SEPTEMBER---3rd.

DEAR MISTRESS ELIZABETH,

Have you ever walked in the spring or fall (or summer or winter woods) and traced an intriguing smell? Well that's what your letter makes me want to do and you and 'Young Alan' must certainly head your noses this way some of these days. The thing that most of all charmed me was the way you rose to my bait--the frizzle hen! My truly , truly story 'Frizzle Soup' has possibilities-----The ending I gave it is all wrong and the trouble now is there are so many possible endings! You are certainly a sympathetic critic
----and I'm sorry I was so hard on you for being satisfied with that tame 'lighted' fire!

Lillie is 'in the tub' washing, Zackie is literally 'in the wheel-barrrow' (tho it is five P.M!) getting a needed snooze  ---having floundered all night.(And I bet a nickle you don't know what flounder is! Well Zackies made $5. doing it and brought home fifty pounds of choice f flounders  ---giving me three such beauties that I celebrated and had the neighbors in.) June is churning----the boys raking and cutting weeds  ---trying to clean up for Jenny Wren who has spent two months with a friend who was bent on getting her well [l] and took her to the mountains. I know 'to be sure' I have the very best selection of friends possible ----a very discriminating person to hear me tell it! Jenny Wren is due home Sunday and we all feel a whole lot like we are having an extra Xmas in September. Such a time of cleaning up and getting ready and everybody excited! I know you understand because you gave it away ----your heart too can 'leap up'. And it doesn't always take a rainbow to do it!

Are you writing too or just like 'Miss Terrill' acting as 'Private Sect.' to a [more] dependent male? (Don't you tell your father- in-law
