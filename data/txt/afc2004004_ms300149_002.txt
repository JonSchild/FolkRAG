Dear Alan.

Rec. your letter and the 'Little Sandy" 
one day last week. thanks so much. You are
 very sweet to a "little old lady waiting." but not
 in her rocking chair. Am working every day
 eccept Sunday which doesnt have a lot of 
time for writing. Oh yes I also got the recard
 the same day as your letter. thanks to you again
 and thanks too for the nice things you said
 about me.

Alan do as you think best with the other
 songs you have altho I know I can do a better
 job of singing than I did on your tapes that 
day as I was so tired and up set.

however if you 
can sell them and think you are satisfied with 
them as they are do so. if I want to record 
some more out at Memphis or for you, I have 
about 100 or maybe 200 which I have not yet 
recorded [??] on tape. some of them good

did the company send you the writer arrangement
 contracts yet they sent them to me back in august 
asking for me to sign and rush them back. said they
 would then have you sign and send my copy (ov)
