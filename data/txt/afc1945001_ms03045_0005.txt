Everyone is aware of the fact that a great deal of Hitler's treachery 
is done from within -- "the Trojan Horse method" -- and it seems to me

their Government) should be recognized for they are, and their damaging
effects counteracted by giving the people better and more authentic news 
broadcasts which they can believe in.
