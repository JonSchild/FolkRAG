Ans.    According to the Information Office of the O.E.M. there 
are no plans at the present time for the confiscation of private
cars.    Gas rationing was instituted because of an actual shortage 
in this area.

2.    Sugar rationing was instituted for the purpose of getting 
personal information for the F.B.I.

Ans.   The F.B.I declares that this is totally false. Sugar 
rationing is completely divorced both in organization and operation 
from the activities of the F.B.I.
