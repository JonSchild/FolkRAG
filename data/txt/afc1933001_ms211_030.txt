Port Aransas, Texas 

I have not been well for months
and the doctors advise this
diversion. Just now and for
three weeks one of my ears
is completely closed. I can
get no relief. I am reducing,
too â€” 10 pounds since I saw
Dr. Neighbors January 1 when he
sternly warned me.

You will now certainly
be too busy to bother
further with the book. I'll
have to ask you often, I fear,
for specific information, but
I'll wait until I get to Washington.
