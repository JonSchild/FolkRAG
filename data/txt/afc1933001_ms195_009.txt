Mr. Alan Lomax
67 Perry Street
New York, N.Y.

Dear Alan:

In answer to your letter of February 8, I think you will find
that the song you ask about is closely related to Stephen Foster's
"Swanee River," and that initially he used the "Pedee" changing it
to "Swanee."  A check at the New York Public should unearth all the
information on that side of it.  As to the folk treatment, of course,
that is open to wide conjecture, and from your own experience you
know how readily this song might either have preceded or followed
Foster's, probably the latter, however.

I haven't yet heard your album but want to.  Dr. Spivacke was
amused at a review (excellent) of it in a St. Louis paper which
quoted "John A." as the editor throughout.

I am proposing a project covering 100 records for you and will
try to follow it through the mill quickly.  We will try to get the
dubs to you within a two week period, but the nation at large seems
to be breathing down our necks.  Can you tell us what material you
will be collecting -- music or talk -- and whether, in view of planned
publication we should place certain restrictions on duplication,
something which we have to do in advance?  Can you send me an answer
on that last right away?

Or rate for dubs is $2.50 for a double-faced 12-inch and $6.00
for a double-faced 16-inch with a 10¢ charge for strips.  Packing is
25¢ for individual records up to 5 in number, and the records are, of
course, shipped express collect.  For our information, why are the
dubs of People's Songs so expensive?  We were quoted a price of $7.50.

From all we hear of New York is popping with folklore and music.
We are very busy here ourselves and are building close relations with
institutions throughout the country.

With best wishes,
For the Librarian of Congress,

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
