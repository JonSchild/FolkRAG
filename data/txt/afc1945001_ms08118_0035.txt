Anecdote

Hilter wanted to find out the
attitude of his people toward him,
so he shaved off his mustache
& went in Berlin. He went into
a movie where the newsreel
was showing his picture, giving 
a speech.

The entire audience stood up and
gave the Hitler salute.
He was deeply pleased & remained
in his seat, when a man
bent over & whispered excitedly:
Ach, man, stand up and salute!
We all feel the same way you do,          [*Folder118*]
