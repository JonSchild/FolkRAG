PIEDMONT BRANCH
OAKLAND PUBLIC LIBRARY
August 15,1942.
Mr. J. B. Kaiser, Librarian,
Oakland Public Library,
Oakland, California.

Dear Mr. Kaiser:
As a member of a "Listening Post", I fear that I have almost nothing to report. The nearest approach to a "rumor" is the statement of a man on August 10 to the effect that "Washington is planning on a five year war." He said that he had had it direct from a friend who was an officer in one of the large banks. Otherwise, there isn't a ghost of a rumor; perhaps libraries are not the place to look for them. I have an idea that they probably flourish more lavishly in the cosy intimacy of bars, busses, and barber and beauty shops, none of which I frequent. Or perhaps, August 10-15 was simply not a good week for rumors. 

Yours respectfully,
Dorothy Collins.
