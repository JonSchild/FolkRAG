Tape: #891 Nimrod Workman 1
Phyllis: This song I remember my daddy used to rock me on
the porch and sing it to me. I guess it's called Quilloquay,
or the Bottler, but it kind of goes like this: (she sings)

Well, the bottler went to the wild boar's den
Quilloquay
[wild boar went]
bottler went to the wild boar's den
There lay the skulls of a thousand men
Quilloquay, quan, quattle down
(she continues) [(then  repeats part of the song)] sings 2 more verses of the ballad.

Nimrod: Yeah, we had plenty of them in Kentucky back then,
when I was small, they was plentiful in Kentucky. And a
few bear.
AL: Ever go hunting wild boar?
Nimrod: No, I was scared. They're a mean. . . .
AL: And Bottler, where'd that name come from, I wonder?
Nimrod: I don't know, someone that made bottles, stuff like
that. 
AL: Phyllis, that was so good, sing us another.
Phyllis: This is another one he used to sing to me when I
was little, if I can remember. (she sings) No, I just call
it the frog song. It's about a frog trying to catch his
dinner, and a blackbird that. . . . .

Whack, said the crane as he set on a log,
Once I caught me a big bullfrog
He danced and he struggled and he got away
Ain't had no dinner all this long day.
(she continues)
[*Dut it notes*]
[*then Nimrod sings a verse, they alternate verses*]
