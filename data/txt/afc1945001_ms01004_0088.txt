What Is A Rumor?

An account of a situation is a rumor when

1. The authoritative source for the account is unknown 
to the person reporting it.

Example: "I hear that they had to use
troops to put down an insurrection 
in a Baltimore aircraft
plant."

2. An authoritative source for the account is designated 
without authority or verifiability.

Example: "At a party the other day, a
friend of mine told me that
the Baltimore police chief
said that they're going to
shoot all the "incurrectionists."

3. The source of the account is an authoritative
person acting in an un-authoritative capacity
(i.e. "leaks")

Example: "The minority leader of the
Senate Committee on Labor
and Education told me confidentially 
that the insurrection 
was due to the weakness 
of the President's labor
policy."

Accounts possessing any one of these traits are
rumors. Thus rumors may appear in communication
media of all types, from all types of people.

The actual truth or falsity of an account has no
bearing on its status as a rumor.
