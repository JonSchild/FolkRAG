having the machine here for so long.
I will do whatever you say.

Mrs. Tartt's arrangements seem
to me [?igthy], for muddy
country roads over red clay hills
would make it impossible
to visit Negro cabins and
Negro rural churches.

Will you please explain
to Mr. Spivacke that the time uncertainty
of the approval of
the Alabama trip (for which I
blame no one) was disturbing
at this end. When the approval
came a week following the machine,
I then could not start
until I heard from Mrs. Tartt.
Now here's her reply.

I'm terribly sorry.

Lovingly, 

Father
