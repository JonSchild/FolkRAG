A     When Tommy would hear about folks who didn't 
appreciate ah mountain and square dance music,
he used to shake his head and say -

MUSIC OFF 

[*03 01 43 25*]     A     When Tommy used to ah - 
When Tommy heard about folks who didn't
appreciate mountain square dance music, ah,
he used to say:  Well I wonder what those 
folks are gonna do when they get to heaven,
just walk off?  Because ah to Tommy that was
the music that was gonna be played there, and
I, I reckon he's up there right now, playing
away, and ah, I know I'll be mighty pleased
if that's what greets me when I pass on.
Tommy Jarrell and his fiddle and his banjo.

That work?
