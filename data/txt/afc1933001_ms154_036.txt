I hear of composition being done in Connecticut
for two weeks - in about a week. [?] That News--
With Time, ink, a desk & cards. I thought of course
Ill write a dozen people--(I never will have
time again) and what comes of it? So far
about five cards - now you - count! --
Big old very cold houses change the bones--
my head is the only hot place I own - at the
moment. Headline - Long-Leak Wedding
and in the interim a letter has been
dispatched. but it doesnt interfere with the
best card trick I know! You ought to have 5 cards viz
4 on the [?] & i on the Lib.
