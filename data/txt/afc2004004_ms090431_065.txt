Fisk, 14.  1. WILL STARK.

We'll tell you 'bout a travellinman,
[W]was born in Tennessee,
Made a livin stealin chickens
And everything else he sees.

If the police got after him,
Then he got on the road.
He catched that [r]freight train
And he got aboard.

[*Chorus*]
Travellin man,
He certainly was a travellin man.
Travellin man that ever was in the lan',
Travellin man.

He was known for miles around,
He didn't get enough,
He didn't get enough
Until the po- lice shot him down,
Until the po-lice shot him down.

Now this travelin man was gran'
To bring a pail of water
The distance he had to go
Was two miles and a quarter.
He went and got the water all right
But he went and stumbled down
He went right back and got another pail
Befo' he hit the groun'.
Travellin man, etc.

He jumped on to the tie of the steamship,
Tried to sail over the ocean blue;
He looked down  and saw that b[o]ig iceberg,
And overboard he flew.
The white folks hollered to break the Lwd:
Now wasn't that nigger a fool?
But when the Titanic steamship went down,
He was shootin crap in Liverpool.
Travellin man, etc.

The courts this travellin man down in Savannah, Georgia,
Sentenced him to be hung.
The people all in that town
Thought the nigger's time had come.
Allowed him three min[tu]utes to prepare a speech
But was carried away until
He crossed hislegs
And walled his eyes
And sailed up to the-ere.
Travellin man, etc.

The po-lice took a Winchester rifle
And shot thenigger right through the head.
The next he come atumblin down to groun'.
