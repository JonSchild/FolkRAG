owner group. They attend the same churches and organization meetings. The
influence is marked; the results salutary.

The best Negro churches in the county are found in this community.
There is a group consciousness and concern about social and racial problems
not observed in the plantation areas. In economic matters the owners are
convinced that the tenants are the most fortunate group in the farm population,
and that they are responsible for the cotton farmers' economic plight.
Tenants on the land of Negro owners do not fare markedly better than do the
tenants on the farms of white owners. Their standard of living is about the
same, but they are able to secure more personal consideration through the
community of interest which their common racial status gives them.

These communities have been declining in relative volume over
recent years, and this has been due to the crowding around and direct infiltration
of white farmers. Some of the earlier settlements are already gone
and others are going. An example of the declining community is the little
community of Farley. It is an almost entirely Negro settlement located about
one mile from the Tennessee River and adjoining Jackson County. The original
community was made up of a group of small homesteaders, with two churches
and a lodge hall. It was the center of an active farming community. Today
only the shadow of its early prosperity remains. The present inhabitants are
old and for one reason or another bound to the community. The churches are old
and weatherbeaten, infrequently used, and the lodge hall leaning and propped 
up with poles. One of the residents said about the community:

This was an absolute colored belt when I was born. But we
lost about 65 per cent of the people. When the migration was
they left for other places, and scattered. White people have
filled their places, and they can't get them back. They was
more prosperous, had more enjoyment, and better getting along.
We got more money right after this war in Europe, but for
civil enjoyment, things got pretty bad for us.
