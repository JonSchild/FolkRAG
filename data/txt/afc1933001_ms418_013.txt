I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE, BABY

I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
You're sure to find
Happiness and I guess,
All those things you've always wanted
Gee I'd like to see you lookin swell, baby,
But diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby,
Till the A.Y.A. you know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love.


THAT'S THE ACT FOR ME     (to the tune of "Oh Susannah)

Oh, the Lundeen Voorhis Maverick Coffee's
Act's the Act for me
And that is why we're here today in
Washington, D.C.
The American Youth Act's the Act for me
Oh, the Lundeen Voorhis Maverick Coffee's
Act's the Act for me.


Sung at the National Youth Congress meetings, Washington, D.C., February, 1937
