It must have been loaned 
out some time ago to somebody.
Anyway, it isn't here.
Can you think who has it?
Miss Landrum gave me the 
most marvellous list of music
to learn this summer.
She says for me to play and 
play - read at sight - just 
take huge [volumes] stacks 
of music and play them
and work on the ones I 
like best.  Which is more 
fun than any thing in the world - 
Bach: French & English Suites

Mozart:  Themes and Variations
Sonatas
Chopin: Preludes
Waltzes
Nocturnes
Beethoven:  Sonatas
Grieg: Holberg Suite and on -
Isn't that exciting! I'll never 
major in music or anything,
but I'll always have it.
I'm lying here on the bed 
with my foot waggling so I 
can hardly write. It is 
very strange; I tell it to stop 
and it just goes right ahead and kicks
