Goshen, Indiana

Dear Mr. Umble:

Your letter of July 20 addressed to Mr. Alan Lomax
has just reached my desk for my attention.  You see, Mr. 
Lomax resigned from the staff of the Library several
years ago and your letter was sent on to him.  Since 
he is now in the Army, the letter took some time to 
reach him and he has just returned it to me.  I have 
made no effort to copy the records you want since you 
said you needed them for the middle of August.  If 
you are still interested in obtaining copies of 
"O Gott Vater Wir Loben Dich," please let me know and
I shall be glad to send an estimate of cost.  
At the same time, can you tell us what song you would 
like on the other side?

Very sincerely yours,


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Music Division
