(Round)  SUMMER IS I-CUMEN IN

Summer is a-coming in, ...
Loudly sing cuckoo, ....
Groweth seed and bloweth mead, 
And springeth wood a-new ....
Sing cuckoo, Ewes are bleating
After lambs and loweth calf and cow. 
Bullock starteth, buck, to verteth, 
Merry sing cuckoo. Cuckoo, cuckoo,
Well now singst thou cuckoo, 
O cease thee never now.

BILLY BOY

Oh, where have you been Billy Boy, Billy Boy, 
O h, where have you been, charming Billy?
I have been to seek a wife, 
She's the joy of my life,
She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.

Did she bid you to come in, Billy Boy, Billy Boy,
Did she bid you to come in, charming Billy?
Yes, she bade me to come in, 
There's a dimple in her chin, 
She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.

Did she set for you a chair, Billy Boy, Billy Boy,
Did she set for you a chair, charming Billy?
Yes, she set for me a chair, 
She has ringlets in her hair
She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.

Can she make a cherry pie, Billy Boy, Billy Boy,
Can she make a cherry pie, charming Billy?
She can make a cherry pie, 
Quick's a cat can wink her eye,
She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.

How old is she, Billy Boy, Billy Boy, 
How old is she, charming Billy?
Three times six and four times seven,
Twenty-eight and eleven, 
She's a young thing and cannot leave her mother.
