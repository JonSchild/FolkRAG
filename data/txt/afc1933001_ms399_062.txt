Cowboy Lingo

Raymon F. Adams
Houghton, Mifflin Company
Riverside Press, Cambridge, 1936.

A cowboy is a man with guts and a hoss who aint much on the 
paw and beller but is quiet as a toad lyin' in the sun. He sleeps 
with his saddle for his pillow and uses his back for a mattress 
and his belly for cover. When he gets up in the mornin' to dress, 
he puts on his hat first and he sometimes wears boots so frazzled 
that he can't strike a match without burnin' his feet. He is so
bowlegged that a yearlin' can run between his legs without bendin'
a hair. His hoss can turn on a quarter and give you fifteen cents
in change. When this cowboy rides into town and gets lit on 
whiskey so strong that it will kick up in the middle and carry
double, he makes more noise than a jackass in a tin barn; then he
gets meaner than gar soup thickened with tadpoles raising hell 
and putting chunks under it. He'll fight you till hell freezes
over, and will skate with you on the ice, and then will stay with you till the hens take the toothache.
He has packed a gun so long
that he feels naked when he takes it off. To a cattle rustler
he is as popular as a wet dog in a parlor social and as [wholesome] welcome
as a polecat at a picnic. When death gets the runnin' iron on him,
he sacks his saddle, passes in his checks for the long trail and
high-tails it to the land of the eternal range. [*? one stanza of Bury me not on the lone prairie.*] 

This combination description of a cowboy I have put together
from one of the many books devoted to the West, and without
