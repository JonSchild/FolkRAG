-9- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York 8-18-42
Brooklyn 8-9 (Girl welder, war plant): "Have a good time right
now with your money is what I say. That inflation will make it no good
soon enough so we'd better use it while it's hot."
New York 8-13: "Well, you can buy up good, solid merchandise
like furniture, jewelry and tools. Then you won't be caught with your
pants down when inflation comes along after election."
New York 8-15: "Inflation is what we had in 19[?]9 when I made
$80 a week in Wall Street with plenty on the side. Inflation is what I 
want some of as quick as I can get it."
New York 8-14: "Did you know the Germans are bringing over
counterfeit money in submarines? That's what the Government is worried
about -- inflation."
Spies and Sabotage
Jamaica 8-11 (Ten cent store salesgirl): "I heard the Coast
Guard has picked up over three hundred spies just on Long Island alone,
all trying to get in from submarines. There must be thousands of them
around, maybe some buying tools in the basement right now."
New York 8-14: "They have found spies right in Brooklyn Navy
Yard. No kidding, I heard it from a guy who works there. The spies
were wearing officer's uniforms and sending messages to submarines."
Brookyln 8-12 (Housewife): "Well they used to say 'never
trust a sailor'. Now it ain't kidding. No wonder the battleships get sunk every
day in the week."
New York 8-9 (Swedish-American mechanic): "You remember
those Nazis, how they got off. Two of them were not killed because they
pretended to help the FBI. That isn't justice, that's damn foolishness.
All of them should have been shot the day we caught them."
