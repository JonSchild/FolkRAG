MEMORANDUM

FROM
Music
DIVISION

TO THE CHIEF OF THE
Mr. Lomax
DIVISION

September 21, 1942

Professor Boggs' suggestion that we send a machine to Bolivia
seems most interesting but I am not in a position to give you approval
for this project without making the usual recommendations
to the Librarian. Before we can do this, however, it seems wise
for you to write to Professor Posnansky by air mail and get all
the details necessary for the project. At the same time you might
investigate the possibility of getting a machine to Bolivia within the
specified time. The State Department might be in a position to give
you information on the time it takes to make such a shipment to
South America.

Respectfully,
Harold Spivacke
