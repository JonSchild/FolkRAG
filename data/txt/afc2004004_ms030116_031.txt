Of methods to give.  You ain't got no business studyin what to give people.
You jist prepare yoursef for heaven.  You jist prepare yoursef an
keep yoursef perfect for God to give it to you.  You git up there an
try to give somethin that you map out you'll make a water haul.  You'll 
have somebody laughin at you.  You'll make yourself a fool before the
public.  I been tryin to preach about eighteen years -- ever since befo
I met this woman here.  I never has got up an made no bad [xxrk] whopper
out of my sermon yet.  Cause it wadn't none of me.  I never did git up
there to say nothin.  Thass the reason God can't use some people they
always love to use theirsef too much an God don't have no chance to use
nobody that uses theirsef.  You deny yoursef of God, didn't you?  The
Scripture say you are bought with a price.  Anytime you buy a dog , you
understand, don't care where he want to go, he goin where you want him
to go.  Whether he stay there or no, you're goin carry him.  Idn't that
right?
Eliz:  Rev. D, when you know you're going to preach I guess you clean up,
dress us, and try to make a nice appearance?
Rev. D:  I do that.  In fact, I try to go nice all the time, cause I don't
know where I'm gon be picked up at.  I'm liable to go out on a Monday
sometime an be picked up and carried away an be gone for a whole week.
To a church.  Somethin like that.  I don't even have to go back home.
Eliz:  What happens when you go out to preach?  You leave your house about
what time?
Mrs. D:  Oh bout eight-fifteen.
Eliz:  Do you have dinner first?
Rev. D: Some time I eat an sometime I don't.
Mrs. D:  Some time he don't feel like eatin.
Rev. D:  Sometimes it's not necessary.  I don't do much eatin when I got
to run a meetin nohow.  I give all my time to God, you understand.
