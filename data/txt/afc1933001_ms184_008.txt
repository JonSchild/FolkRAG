Dear Alan:

I have just received a letter from the Program Director of the USO who will come to see me next Friday that he is very much interested in encouraging folk music in the USO Clubs. I quote the paragraph from his letter:

"I am also anxious to find ways of introducing more folk music into Club programs. As you know, we are concerned with an introduction of service men to the locality in which they find themselves through excursions, lectures, motion pictures, literature, etc. I would like your advice on resources which might be put in the hands of Club Directors in this connection."

Will you please send me a short note with your suggestions for such a program? Please remember what a USO Club is like and fit your ideas to the surroundings. This sudden interest from the national office is very encouraging because I have also heard from Patrick Gainer, whom you know, who is now in charge of music for the NCCS, one of the branches of the USO. This looks like the best folk song opening I have found in connection with the services as yet and I want to do everything I can to follow through. (Please do not delay sending me the test pressings because I have nothing to play for these people when the come - another reason why I should have them.)

Enclosed you will find a list prepared by Mrs Schwartz of the music to be used on the Latin American transcriptions. It occurred to me that if we were to put strips of all these pieces on the back that the selections would be too short for any use whatever. I had hoped to give the Latin American announcers the equivalent of a "music service." They would then be apt to use a single piece or two pieces whenever they had a few minutes to fill in just as they use popular dance music at present. I think it would be better to have a minute and a half or two minutes of a piece on the back than just a few seconds which would happen if we put the music for all the pieces used in the script. I am asking you therefore to indicate on this list which
