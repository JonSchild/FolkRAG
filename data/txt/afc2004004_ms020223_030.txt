BJ:  Well, they had some old hymns.
AL:  They started always with a hymn?
BJ:  Tha's right.
AL:  They didn't start with a song?
BJ:  No.  No, they started a ol' hymn.  Tha's all.
AL:  And then, after they sang one song, what did they do then?
BJ:  We-well, they sang a s-- probably two or three.  You know,
of course, they hymn goes down to about three.  It jest
like you start off with a, with a hymn, an' well you have --
it goes about three ah, it would go about three rhymes of song.
Then you sing about, about two rhymes sittin' down an' then they 
stand.  An' everybody stands an' sings that one an' then they
hum it an' then they go down -- some of 'em go down -- in prayer.  They
just ask for anyone, anyone feel, you know.  An' ah, ah, ah, they
need a prayer.  Jus' go down in prayer, anyone that feel like
prayin', jus' go down in prayer.
AL:  Well now, where I've been. . .
BJ:  That's in the Baptist.
AL:  Yeah.  Well, where I've seen in the Baptist Church, it's 
usually the deacon that does that.
BJ:  Well, tha-that's right.  In the Baptist Church, they does.
Uses the deacon, see?  To start it.  An' uses the deacon to
start it now, if he's there.  If he ain't there, we jus' go on
an' start; we don't wait on 'im.  See?
AL:  What I've noted is that these deacons usually have great,
big voices. . .
BJ:  In, in some.  Look like they can git it out. . .
AL:                     the voice like the bull . . .
BJ:  Ain't the Lord jus' give 'em that?!  Ain't it sumpthin'!
