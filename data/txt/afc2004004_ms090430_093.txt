Two high schools serve the county for secondary school education,
one four-year high school for white children and a recently acquired high
school for Negroes, which has been adding a grade each year until at the
present time it offers four years of high school work. The white high
school has a population of 2,951 pupils and the Haynes School for Negroes
has 58 pupils. The small number of Negro high school students is accounted
for in part by the lack of transportation to the school for the widely
scattered Negro homes in the county.

Remaining in school proves an acute problem for many of the Negro
children. Of 1,326 recorded in the county for 1935, 14.4 per cent had
reached the second grade, and only 4.1 per cent of the school population
had completed the seventh grade. (1) An elementary school education is considered
sufficient by many parents for the needs of a child in the rural
community. The sharp dropping off in numbers of children who complete the
consecutive grades may be accounted for largely by the fact that their earning
power is needed at home. One mother said:

We want L to go through the grades. Ain't much
change of her going any higher. We needs her here to
work. Cost so much to keep children in school these
days. All this book buying is hard on us.

The teachers are pointing out, sometimes to the dismay of the students,
that their chances for remunerative work in future depends upon getting at
least a high school education.

Retardation is another factor which contributes to the dropping
out of school after the first four grades. Irregular school attendance,
both as a result of economic necessity and lack of interest, contributes to
this retardation. There is in this area more sensitiveness to overageness
