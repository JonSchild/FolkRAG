Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
Clarksdale, Mississippi

Dear Alan:

Your airmail letter was received but the chief is out of the 
office on a weeks vacation. At present none of the specific questions 
which you ask can be answered. We have no allotment for next
year and that being the case you realize the information you seek
is not obtainable. Neither are we in a position to answer your
question regarding the work with Dr. Jackson. I am afraid you will
just have to wait and see how things develop.

You have received an invitation to speak at a meeting in
Indianapolis on October 22. This is a conference of the music section 
of the Indiana State Teachers Association. Apparently they are
willing to pay some kind of a fee but they give no indication of
their limitations. Will you please think about this and if you wish
to contact the President of the Music Section, write to Miss Thema C.
Sines, Logansport Public Schools, Logansport, Indiana.

Sincerely yours,

Edward N. Waters
