Dear Mrs. Campbell:

     Your letter addressed to Mr. Alan
Lomax has come to my attention. As 
you know, Mr. Lomax is now with the
Office of War Information. Unfortunately,
we have no loan or rental service,
but duplicates of our records are
available at cost.

     I [n] doubt whether the square dance
record in the Folk Music of the United
States set is suited to use for dance
groups. We are, however, planning to
issue dance records with calls in the
near future. I regret that we cannot
send pressings on approval. A demonstration
set is available here, and I
trust it will be possible for you to
visit the Archive soon.

     Sincerely yours,

     B.A.Botkin, Assistant in Charge
     Archive of American Folk Song
