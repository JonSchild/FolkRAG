No spear shall rive thee
No sea shall drown thee
No woman shall wile thee
No man shall wound thee
Another nice one p.33
-
Yarrow
I will pluck the yarrow fair
That more benign shall be my face
" " warm shall be my lips
That more chaste shall be my speech
Be my speech the (?) beams of the sun
Be my lips the sap of the strawberry

May I be an isle in the sea
" " " a hill on the shore
" " " " star in the waning of the moon
May I be a staff to the weak
Wound can I every man
Wound can no man me
