Lecture
For the part [?] years
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to take you into my sonfidence, it is very hard to prepare a lecture on American folk-songs, because there are so many of them that I want to sing and talk about. The only proper way to do is to sit around all night long and swap songs. One time I swapped songs about animals with a friend of mine from eight until two one night and we quit at a draw. Now I'd like to start you out and educate you up in mountain ballad singing. Each mountain ballad averages about ten minutes if you sing it slow like its supposed to go with plenty of time to smoke your pipe in between verses. And to give you an idea of even the most important ballads you have to sing ten or twelve that's a couple hours right there. Then there the religious songs, Negro white, Mexican.... Baptists, Methodist, Campbellite, Holy Roller, all different... [?] Idd lie to teach you how to gamble, drink, sniff cocaine, run around at night and fight with folk songs. Then on to the chain gang and the lonesome jailhouse for a few years... No, telling where we might end up....." The point is that we have so much good music right here in America, that belongs to the people, that wasn't written by a flaxen haired boy on Broadway for a thousand dollars, that was never plugged by anybody, that was made by the people, the common people, the spat uponexcept in times of election people, they don't know a note of music but they can play things on the guitar and banjo and fiddle that the educate boys can't do.... (FIDDLE TUNES ORY+++CALAHAN+++WHERE IT CAME FROM) .... It is really the music of our democracy and we out to cherish it, although it will go right along without our cherishing it.... A folk so g.... define....democratic by definition... [?]
