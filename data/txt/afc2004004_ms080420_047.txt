                          . . . .and shove everything out of the living room and
                          have a big dance.  And he originated the Bascomb Memorial
                          Lamford (?) folk festival some years ago, I think, and
                          it's still the leading folk festival around.
                          AL:    In those old days there was dancing in all kinds of
                          communiites every Saturday night.  And then it went out because, 
                          or what caused it to go down?
                          Man:   People thought they had to drink, ya know, to have a 
                          good time and that ruined everything.  It got a bad name.
                          Man 2:   They used to think if you was a dancer you was part
                          of the devil's work.  But they've come to realize that . . .
                          AL:   You could get kicked out of the church for dancing,
                          couldn't you?  Did you every get kicked out of the church for
                          dancing?
                          Woman:   No, not yet.
                          Man:   Now there's people who've come back to it, they realize
                          that its' not as bad . . . (unintelligible) . . . . it's a good
                          passtime. I guess right now there's most clogging groups
                          that's ever been in history, right now.
                          AL:   And more coming on all the time. What do you all think 
                          of this precision clogging, tell us about that.
                          Lot's of no's.
                          Woman:   Don't talk to us about it.
                          Woman2:   It's something that you have to count, and you have 
                          to do the same step, everybody had to be together, it's 
                          just like a reel (?) team. And I don't want something that 
                          I have to work at, that I have to continuously count and 
                          watch and do exactly what someone else does. That's too
