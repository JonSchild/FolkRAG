RUMORS

Nebraska
August 8, 1942

General Summary:
In spite of the fact that the confident predictions of many (that the war
would not be of long duration) have collapsed, people seem to be resigned and 
are accepting the fact of a long war with calmness and a determination to

millions of tax money", and that because of this, "people of the Midwest are

the primaries of next week, there might possibly be some surprising results.  
People are not interested in politics as this time, and the vote is expected to
be very light in all sections.  The farmers are too busy trying to cope with the
labor shortage in the harvest fields (which is a problem though not serious as
