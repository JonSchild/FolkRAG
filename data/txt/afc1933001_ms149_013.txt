Dear Mr. Lomax:

My colleague, S. M. Koenigsberg, told me that
you were interested in collecting folk ballads.

I recently ran into an old chap from Tamworth,
New Hampshire, who has a fine collection of various
vintages.  Some of his ballads apparently were brought
over from England by the early settlers, some are comparatively 
of recent origin, commemorating local events,
and other range in between.  He sings them with fire,
and apparent authenticity.

If you are at all interested I shall be glad
to suggest how to get in touch with him.

Sincerely yours,


Barrow Lyons
