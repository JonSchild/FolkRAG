Alamo Hotel
Austin, Texas

5/9/1939.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
All supplies are here. Thanks for your fine promptness --the 
only known government agency that is  punctual.
We have  filled 60 records Some special items
1. A lot of cowboy songs with genuine cowboy singers.
2. A group of Spanish narrative ballads with local setting;
e.g. The Purple Bull
3. Some fine Mexican play tunes and lullabies.
4. Some roaring western breakdowns with lots of singing
between occasional bars.

We have traveled 1600 miles. The machine is working
beautifully. We start on East tonight. After a few stops we
cross in to Arkansas and Louisiana.

Next address in Huntsville, Texas.

Dornbush has killed my chance of getting real cowboy singers
from Texas.

Yours,
Lomax
