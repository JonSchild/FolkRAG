Dear John Avery:

We called for your favorite
daughter this evening and went
to the Texas division at Toffenetti's
(43 & Bwy), thence to Fred Allen
Show at CBS, featuring Simone Simon
and including Joe Phipps, outstanding
undergraduate of U.T. - a very
likeable fellow, who said he had a
good take-off on O'Donnells but tey
wouldn't let him give it, so he
gave something on the Bill of
Rights instead, with musical
background and foreground. Fred
Allen told us Joe did first rate; the
control room said he went well on
the air.
