experience was so painful that
I swore never to try it again -- at
least until I had lost 30 pounds
& had learned to jitterbug.

   I have taken to sitting in St. Germaine
of nights, trying to pick up young
girls, visiting lame countesses,
ogling whores, speaking to women
out of car windows asking my
friends to arrange dates, masturbating,
knocking on hotel doors & doing a 
1000 things typical of the lonely
homely young man in Paris.  There's 
no poetry in it.  If prison is any
worse than this life of mine, with
all the freedom in the world, enough
money, time, health to do 
exactly as he pleased I don't
know what it is.
