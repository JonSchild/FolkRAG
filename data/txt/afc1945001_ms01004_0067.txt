Dear Mr. Irving:

                 I have your letter of July 4 and will look forward to
your visit to Washington in the course of the next few weeks.
I am sure that there are a number of matters of mutual interest
which we can usefully discuss.

                 In the meantime, I will ask one of my associates to
look over our material to see if we have anything on the subjects
which you mention.
                                                                    Sincerely yours,
                                                                    [*151?*]
