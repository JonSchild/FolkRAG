During the months since Pearl Harbor, rumors charging all 
manner of disloyalty, exploitation, and malevolence have been circulated 
about the Jews in this area. Perhaps the most frequent is the charge 
that the Jews are escaping the draft. This rumor, in its many forms, 
has persisted despite local efforts to discredit it and its complete 
lack of basis in fact, so far as can be ascertained. Clearly, this 
story constitutes one of the most vicious and unsubstantiated charges 
leveled against the Jewish people in this country.
The following are several specific variants of this basic 
theme which are now current.
(1)   Jews are bribing their way out of the draft.
(2)   Jewish boys are taking pills or injections which so affect 
them that they are rejected at their physical examination.
(3)   Jewish doctors on Draft boards see to it that Jewish boys 
are rejected from the draft.
(4)   Jews are claiming dependents falsely and thus escaping 
the draft.
(5)   Jews are getting soft jobs in defense industries and 
Government offices and then claiming exemption.
In one survey conducted recently by this office, the following 
question was asked. "Have you heard that any particular group of Americans 
is evading the draft? Who?" Thirty-six percent of the responses specified 
the Jews and cited one or more of the specific variants listed above.
Since this charge is one calculated to arouse great bitterness 
among those who accept it, and since it is clearly of wide currency both 
in this area and elsewhere in the nation, the Division of Propaganda 
Research wishes to bring these facts to the attention of proper authorities. 
It is hoped that they will undertake to provide us and the public
