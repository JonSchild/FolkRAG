6) Scot. ballads made by [glee] men trained by tradition
& descent.
Northern Eng. bal style close to Scotch. 
7)  in incremental rep. char. of other types of songs 
8) comp. with [other] ballads from other countries show 
that bal. are story types, singable or easily recited, 
whose authors & origins have been lost but that 
there is no ballad style that is the "same." 
- through one com. there is likely to be a certain 
uniformity of style through a certain period, but 
mostly songs are made over to suit the horizons 
of their singers 
style changes in folk  as well as book poetry. 
IV  Improvisation & Folk-Song 
tremendous time gap between prim, song, consisting
of monotonous repetition, and medieval ballad 
which tell a story with a high artistic value as poetry 
that composing throng originated Child ballads is 
pure conjecture 
if we throw out "inner light" & depend on 
existing evidence in the present diffusion of 
popular poetry. This ev. is more imp. 
than anthropological responding primitive 
poetry. 
Real com. poetry, if we take cowboy, [?] 
songs + N. spir is "rude incoherent 
lacking in [?] and 
memorable qualities." 
N[ever]o  record of any such piece becoming 
like a Child ballad. even tho they emerged
 from [a people]  groups more homogenous 
than [me] the medieval villagers. (Nix!!!)
