Outline of Louise Pound's Poetic Origins and the Ballad .
Chapter I. Beginnings of Poetry
Certain Indian societies require that each member have a song of his
own to sing on special occasions---seperate from ceremonial songs--
each man sings his song---pandemonium." Miss Alice Fletcher. (1)
Communal Authorship.
The traditional view that song and poetry originate in the communal
group--no singing without dancing-- is in fact unproveable by reference
to primitives all over the world. "That it is an absurd chronology
which assumes that individuals. . . " (9). if it were true, instances
noted of communal singing should outnumber those of individual authorship.
They don't if we take the word of those who have studied this phenomenon
with an especial interest. Not that song isn't a social phenomenon. . .
Individual authorship.
Indian has a feeling of private ownership in his song. Dream songs.
Australian aborigines recognize bards as extraordinary, almost seers.

great mass of primitive songs sung in communal gatherings, not usually
improvised for the occasion but repeated verbatim, for with a deviation
the ceremony sometimes has to be reccomenced. "as far back as we can go
in the genisis of song-craft, there are impromptu songs and traditional
songs." Solo dancing also, "a Kaffir differs from an European
vocalist in this point, namely, that he always, if possible, sits down
when he sings."
The ballad as the earliest poetic form.
"The opinion is prevalent among folklorists and students of literature
that since ballads come down to us by tradition they represent poetry
in its most primitive." (27) "Certainly if ballad means, as it usually
does, song-story, the ballad was not the earliest form of poetry;
the people never danced to ballads. The earliest songs we can get track of
are purely lyrical not narrative. The melody is the important thing."
(29) Accounts of individual exp. or incidents tell no story worth telling
"Taht demands length, elaboration, or completeness beyond primitive powers.:
"Vocal action of the singing type i.e. melody may well by as instinctive
in man as in the birds." (30) The narrative song is a late development.
No primitive song tells a story with real elabotation or completeness.
And songlets not specifically improvised in a festal dance. Primitive
song may have one, two, many or no words.

Assumption of intimate connection between ballad and dancing throng.
The name ballad----
45)     1)Ballad in the fourteenth century meant the R French art lyric with the 
fixed form. This in the period when it could mean dance song, it did not
mean narrative lyrics.
2) Elizabethan period. Songs or lyrics of any sort, to dance songs, and
occasionally to narrative songs.
3) 18th cent. still loose popular usage. Specialists to nar lyrics.
but pieces collected by specialists were not dance songs. 
4) still popularly reffered to song, but increasingly precise for spec-
ialist.
This variation has allowed the scholar to argue from documentary evidence
that narrative song was danced all during this period.
