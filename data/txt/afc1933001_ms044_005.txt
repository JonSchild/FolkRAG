Mr. Harris

May 24, 1937.

Mrs. Irvin F. Farr,
R. F. D. No. 3, Box 126,
Bristol, Vermont.

Dear Mrs. Farr:

Your letter of April 3rd was so long delayed that 
I had no chance to reach you before you had need of the dance
calls. Perhaps I can get some to you later if you still have
need for them. There will be no charge.

I was very much interested to know that your section
of Vermont still preserved the old square dances. I offer my
congratulations to a real American community.

Sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax
National Advisor of
Folklore and Folkways
