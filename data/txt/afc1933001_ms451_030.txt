BATSON    page four
They put a black bonnet xxxx above his head,
They put a rope right in his neck,
They put handcuffs xxxx on his hands
xxx balls and chains on his foot.
And
The people begin to cry,
"Umm-mm-mm,
Um-mmmm-mmmm
Poor Batosn he is dead and gone."
The clear blood run out of his eyes,
Nobody/couldn't see his face,        /they
And a tongue stuck out/of his mouth    /,out
Six inches long. 
A rubber-tired buggy,
[Decarated] Decorated horse,
You know they brought Batson to the grave-yard
Says, they brought his family back.
His wife walked up to the grave,
Fell down on her knees,
Says, "Lord, have mercy, "
Says, "Batson, are you gone?
Batson's wife began to pray,
Pray as hard as she could
Prayed so much xx until it looked like
The Lord done answered her prayer.
I thought I heard somebody say
A while before she left,
Says, /xx xxx goin' leave me, /you're
But I'll meet you some lonesome day."
Batson's little girl cryxx
Batson's little child cry,
That's all he asked them people,
Take keer of them two little girls.
Um-mmm,-xxx-xxxx
Um-mmm-mmm
Um-mmm,
The tears run out of his eyes.
Think I heared somebody say,
Bye-bye Batson, bye-bye,
Bye-bye, Batson, bye-bye,
And I believe he's dead and gone.
