the St. Louis meeting comes too 
soon for me to prepare 
a satisfactory program 
and that I have referred t
he entire matter to my 
superiors in the Library 
of Congress. Please let me 
know your reaction frankly
and fully.

I appreciate your cordial
letters, and I understand 
your situation.  When I 
come to Washington again, 
stay three months and 
more and see as little
