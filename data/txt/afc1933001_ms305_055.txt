   Neither martial airs nor
patriotic tunes in the ordinary
sense of those words, these songs
are not new. Many of them are 
anonymous and most of them tell
of hard work, the everyday
work of earning a living.
   They sing of picking cotton in 
the South, churning butter on a 
farm, working on a railroad, on 
a chain gang, building levees or 
cow punching in the West. They 
speak to a mule to talk to a lady
love and often in the same vein.
   But most of all the songs speak
of America, and that is why they 
may be used to defend the 
country from which they sprang.

At the White House
   Several events are conspiring
to bring folk songs to the fore. 
For instance a performance was
presented at the White House last
Monday night under the direction
of the Library of Congress entitled.
"A Program of American
Songs for American Soldiers,"
and the White House timbers
shook to the strains of "Whoopee 
To Yo. Git Along, Little Dogies." 
"Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill," and
"The Boll Weevil," sung by enlisted
service men as well as 
professionals.
   Mrs. Roosevelt commented 
afterwards in her column: "I hope
these songs spread through all
the branches of the service. I 
would like to see musical instruments
available and records of
these songs in the recreation
centers and in every community 
center near a camp throughout 
the country. I think it would 
make us conscious of our rich 
background of folk literature and 
music."
   The Library of Congress, too, 
according to the Librarian, Archibald
MacLeish, hopes that the
Army morale service will wish
to ask for their extensive materials
and have them made available
in recordings and text. He
thinks these songs are great
"democratic indoctrinators,"
   One thing is certain. No other 
country in the world could have
produced a song like this one of a 
cow puncher, which goes:
"Oh slow up, dogies, quit your
     roving around.
You have wandered and tramped
     all over the ground

Songs of the People
   For many years Lomax and his
son, Alan, now an assistant in
the library's division of music,
have been traveling into remote
and isolated regions of the country
recording songs of the people,
all of which are now in the 
library. In 1910 from a Negro 
saloonkeeper in san Antonio,
Tex., Lomax first heard and 
recorded "Home On the Range"
which he says is a favorite of
President Roosevelt and which
Admiral Byrd played on a portable
victrola at the South Pole
until his instrument froze.
   Aside from the possibility of
using the songs in camps, other
developments forecast a general 
increasing knowledge and use of
folk songs. One of these is a 
series of 13 broadcasts being
recorded by John A. Lomax for 
radio use. The library has not 
yet worked out plans for distribution
of these programs but will
announce them later.
   Another method is the broadcast
every other Tuesday made by 
Alan Lomax, assistant in the 
division, on Columbia's American  
School of the Air which reaches 
a reputes 130,000 schools all over
the country.

Library of Folk Music
   And nearing completion is the
library's streamlined sound
laboratory, built with a Carnegie
grant of last spring which will
make duplicate recordings 
possible. This means the extensive
15,000-song library of folk
music will be available to the 
public,  hitherto impossible becase
master recordings wear out if 
played too often.
   In four months, too, the WPA 
check list f the songs that will be 
finished which will enable interested 
institutions and people to
order the songs they want from
the library. Right now no one
knows quire what is in the collection.
   So come what may, it looks very
much as though America will
meet the crisis with - among 
other things - a song about the 
life it leads and the lings it 
loves and stands for.
