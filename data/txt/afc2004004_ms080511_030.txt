And ah, but not this, [this group here. One
after another they come and they show ah
their steps, and then go back into the ah
line. Ah, each one does an extraordinary solo
and then tries to top the other one, but so
far as co-ordinating their complexity, that
doesn't happen.]

But [when you go to a, a, a black dance, as we
do herein ah, in North Carolina, deep in the
Piedmont where, where ah the old buck dance
tradition of, of ah, black America that
fuels the minstrel show and, and fuelled ah
the flatfoot dancing tradition of the mountains
is still alive as it used to be. //Here you have
dancers who are, are having a conversation with
their bodies, and a very witty one, and a very
ironic one too. Because there's irony here for 
them. They're having - their feet are actually
talking to each other, and they say that.
They, they make their feet talk.// One of them 
can do a train, another one can do a, a Ford
starting up. But between those actual ah dance
mimes, in between those feet are talking the 
language of the dance to each other and
their bodies, and they're picking up from each
other.
