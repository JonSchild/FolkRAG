Well there was an old lady that used to sell papers. So once she took a notion that she [wan] wanted to cross a bridge that was close by her stand. She went up to a soldier and said I want to go accross that bridge and the soldier said no you can't go accross that bridge lady. There was another soldier standing near by and everyone had said that he had been dead for three days but the old lady had forgotten so she said why don't you help me and the soldier [re] answered haven't you heard "I've been dead for three long days now"
