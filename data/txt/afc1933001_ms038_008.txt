Dear Mr. [?]: Please
have my report typed before
you attempt to read it. I have
no available type-writer. I 
hope, too, that you can hone
the titles [?] and [?] [?]
[?] after the classification 
or the class of the report.
Whatever modification of the
typer, or in any other particulars
of the report, will be satisfactory
to me.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
