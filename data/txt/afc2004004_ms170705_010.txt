farmer, now fully realizing the extent of the
his wife's spite & hatred says "And do you think
that I do?"
So - it all turns out well. But it was such a 
superb film, & marvellously acted. French is
such a marvellous language for venom! The
mother - well! She'd stand in the middle of the 
room, then her eyes would gleam, her lips
pinched together, she smiled, then
looked around for the boy. "Oh, Poil de
Carotte," she'd say, empahsizing the " 'tte'
at the end. And the little girl was really the
most sweet & really innocent child I ever saw.
And the boy was strange, something of a down, with
heavy, sad & merry eyes, and a walk like a gawky
bird. And so moving in the scene where he tries to hang
himself. It was almost unbearable to watch this child
driven to death, against his will. And another marvellous
scene where he'd been sent to the mill and was driving
the cart home along the lanes, and at every turning
there was a mother kissing her baby, or father steadying
his son on a horse, or children playing together; and 
the look on his face as he passed them & (?) to look at
them, finally whipping his hose & racing along
the road, tears streaming over his freckled cheeks. And
all the country faces, wise & calm & knarled. It was a 
masterpiece as I said. And I said to the manager
as I came out she said "It stands up well, doesn't it."
Lord, I felt like attacking him. And I sent Dolly & Lon to see it,
too, & they weren't impressed. I wonder what wrong with
people. Eh, bien mon cher, no more nsom. Shirley E.
