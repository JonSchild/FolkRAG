Steve Daniel's daughter was named Gertrude.  I was called "Little
Man."  Me and her were the only two people in the camp that weren't
married.  We hung out together and they fixed us up a tent and
married us off.  Her mother runned the kitchen and I didn't have t o 
buy no food.  I boarded there.

AL:Now were you going with Gertrude before they married you off.
Were you fooling around with her?
WB:Sure I was fooling around with her.  But I wasn't out there ove r
three weeks before they built a tent for us.  And I was working there
about three months before Mr. Brown and me had a run in. 

AL:What did she say?  Do you remember any of the conversations yall had? 
WB:Oh yeah, we used to go down from the camp and sit down by the side
of some rock pile and talk.

AL:What did you talk about? 
WB:Oh we'd talk about being together and she be[e]ing my girlfriend 
and all like that.  She'd get to smiling and I'd put my hand on hers and
she'd get weak and I'd pull her over and kiss her.  So we'd sit around
there and have a nice time.  I was living in a bull pen with about
8 or 9 nine men in there.  One night I asked her about sleeping out.
She said, "Well," she said, "where we going."
I said, "We going down the road.  It doesn't amke me no difference."
We went down the road and we came back again.
Every morning we went to eat our breakfast.  My breakfast would
be fixed special.  Other people would be eating salt mea[n]t and bisquits
