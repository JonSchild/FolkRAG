BJ TAPE 15 p. 61

BJ:  That's right.  An' that -- That's right.  If I to, I, I. . .
that was me, [ya] see?  But I know better'n to put a man in that
house there.  An' another thing:  We don't have [men] 'em around there.  'Cause
if ya do, ah, he gonna try ta take anyway.  He, he'll. . .A man is a 
funny thing.  He's a car-ish actin' thing, ya know?  You know, in
that, in that way.  If he find ya single.  And ah, and [ah,]
especially if you give in an' try ta act nice, you fix him sumpin'
to eat or you -- just treat 'im nice.  You go out with 'im an'
social wit' 'im.  Some of 'em'll git too fer an' try to take
over, see?
     Come in, he'll leave his hat.  Hang, hang up his hat, see?
Hang up his coat.  All kinda mess.  "Jus don't hang up nothin'.
Just eat you food, laugh an' talk, an' hit the road!"  See. I
mean, you, it's best to do it.  'Cause you see one doin' them
things, he set there, he gits so careless; he lay down 'cross the
bed, his back hurts, an' all that kinda mess.  "Git up, son, an'
set down!  Ya want to take a nap, git in a chair."  'Cause that
starts sumpin' right there.  An' he's in there, "How come I can't
res' some?  Let them chillun be quiet!"  See?  He starts to go
to bossin', see?  Don't start it 'cause he'll jus' wake up!
"Sit there in the chair.  Don't let the chillen see ya layin'
down on the bed.  I don' want 'em [to] see ya on the bed."  See?
I be meanin' it.  "If you don't like it, hit the road!"  Hah!
That's the truth.  An' that's the gospel, if I never move.
AL:  You said that to men?
BJ:  I says it, yes I have.  "Don't, don't lean on my bed.
Don't get up on my bed 'cause, first thing they gonna see, chillun,
chillun come in an' see ya in the bed; somebody else'll walk in the
do'.  They'll see ya in the bed."  See?  He jus' a flatter to ya.
