Dear Mr. Lombard: 

This letter gives you the option for a three-week concert tour
beginning October 19, 1964 for Bessie Jones and the Georgia
Sea Island Singers.  There will be five singers, in addition
to Mrs. Jones.  There will also be a guitar player, who will
be coming from Mississippi.  This option should be exercised
prior to June 16, 1964.

The fee I suggest is $2,000.00 per week for the six Sea
Islanders and an additional $200.00 per week for the guitar
player, thus the guarantee would be $2,200.00 per week.  It
is agreed that you are going to pay the transportation of the
group to and from Minneapolis and on the course of the tour,
but that they will take care of their own living expenses.

If you insist on seven concerts a week, I am agreeable, but I
really feel that five -- and if absolutely necessary, six --
would be fairer to the troupe.

As far as I am concerned, this concludes our discussion of
the matter, and I wish you all the best luck in booking the
tour.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax

P. S.  Enclosed is material for your use in publicizing the
group.  I would appreciate its return when you have finished
with it, as I do not have duplicates of all the material.
