to live an don't live, thass pitiful. 
A wild mule will run away. He'll hurt ever body but hissef. If a 
mule got sense enough not to hurt hissef, we ought to be able to keep 
from hurtin ouwaselves. 
You know who you is? You ain't jes yo natchul self only. You is your
friends too. If you hurt your friends, you hurt yoursef too. 
Some of ouwah peoples is very treacherous. You can't handle them 
any kind of way. You go to handle them wid kid skin gloves. Everything 
you say, they take it to heart. One of His Ciples Jesus kept with Him 
all the time cause Peter was touchous. Quick to the fight. Had a temper. 
Jesus kept Peter wid him so he could nuss some of that out of him. Jesus 
wanted a good port on Peter. Like a bad-tempered chile. You can leave 
your other chillern but not that one. Jesus lef His other Ciples but he 
kept Peter wid him. 
Anytime you cut your friends off you cut your life off. A pusson 
without friends might as well be in his grave. Thass the terriblest 
misery ever was. People have lost confidence in you. You done messed 
yosef up. Lost favor. I'll take a pistol and blow my brains out right 
then. 
How the Lord bless you -- somebody is a friend. All of us wants 
somebody to throw dey arm round us wid a welcome feelin. Not only I. 
You do. I do. I'll dry up yo tears an then it'll make you cry again 
thinkin bout it. 
It means somethin. (falsetto cry. Tears in voice) It means 
somethin. Heah you is broke down. Miserable. Feel like you wanna jump 
in the river. Somebody can cheer you up. A friend. 
A fool ain't got sense enough to kill his own self. I heah some people 
say only a fool kills hissef. No! A fool aint got sense enough to know 
when he's in a bad way.
