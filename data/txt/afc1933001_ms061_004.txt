Dear Mr. Spivacke: I have 
just sent Mr. Wetherold this
proposition, to wit: 
1. I'd do his Washington albums
at once for 2 cents a record, including 
notes or introduction for 
each album, provided,
2. He would allow advance
commissions to the amount of 
$100.00 to cover expenses for Miss
Terrill and me while we are 
doing the work.
To you I will say that
