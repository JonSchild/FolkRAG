Lomax:  And the girls were farid not to?

McBeth:  There was terrible trouble in Scotland over that.  There was
a lot took to law about it.

Lomax:  You mean the girls were afraid to refuse?

McBeth:  Aye - they couldna resist.  And when they were taken to law
about it, they were afraid to tell.  The sherriff and the head they
put them through degrees.  It came out then, what took place all over 
the country at the time.  But a lot of the girls - good-looking-girls -
come home to be servants at the farms, and that's what took place.

Lomax:  Now why were they afraid to tell, Jimmy?

McBeath:  Because they didna like to give people a shock - be
being a married farmer and having a big farm - they didna like to tell.

Lomax:  But why did they give in to these men?  Did they like them?

McBeath:  No - it was forced - they were forced by the master.

Lomax:  Did he tell them he'd fire them and do on?

McBeth:  Yes, and he kind of frightened them - of their wages - and
he'd give them backhanders, too.  It was a terrible time that time.

an older man, wouldn't he?

McBeth:  Yes.  there's  a lot of farmers committed suicide over that.
There was one in Banff about a year ago did that.  He drowned himself
in the pond.  He was carrying on with another girl and she had a 
child by him and he took the child and buried it in the garden and 
then he drowned himself in his own dam, and they caught him there
about eighteen months - two years ago.  That's the truth - that
happened in Banffshire.  A place called Rosy Burn.

Lomax:  Have you ever heard the girls talk about this themselves -
the farm girls?

McBeth:  O yes.  There's a Laird up in ------used to carry on
with the nurse.  I've herd of some of the lairds doing that.

Lomax:  They just think they owned the world.

McBeth:  Yes.  There was an earl here did that.  He died about six
or seven months ago.  It was true, quite true.   He was a dreadful
fellow, and his brother's alive yet.  He owns all the land 
up at Monnymusk, and he caried on with the nurses.  He carried on
