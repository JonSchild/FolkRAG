War Jokes Accepted
Rumors
1  The other day I heard a 
radio commentator say that Hitler
is believed dead.
2  [The old] Another rumor about
Hitler is that he has been relieved
of his authority by three of his generals.
3  Moussolini is said to be
suffering with a brain diease and
requires an operation, but is afraid
to let his surgeons operate because 
they might kill him.  He will not
call in German doctors because
he is afraid of what Hitler might
tell them to do.
