        " 'But Major Brackenridge, " I exclaimed, 'I don't un-
derstand why you want to give a valuable tract of land to the
people of Jackson County when they once tried to hang you!'
        " 'Well, Colonel Bill, ' he smiled, 'When I came to draw
up the papers donating that land, I got to thinking about the happy [da]
days I once spent in Jackson County, about the good people who
lived there and of their kindness to me..... And when I remembered
all those things, I got to feeling so damn glad that the boys
let me get away that time that I thought I'd give 'em some land.' "

        And now nearly half of the fifty years have gone since
Major Brackenridge transferred the land to the University of Texas. 
I understand it has never yet been used for educational purposes.
Jackson County's claim on that valuable tract steadily improves
as the outcome of a grimly gracious joke of George W. Bracken-
ridge. It has often been pointed out how, as Regent of the Univer-
sity, he always resolutely opposed selling the University's
lands in West Texas. Now hundreds of oil wells dot that same land,
spouting liquid gold into the University's endowment fund.
