H. Rumor No. 8 was heard in Stroud, Oklahoma, August 6, 1942.

1. "You don't have to do a lick of work on one of them defense
 jobs. All you got to do is join the union, and get on the
 job. A fellow told me that's what he did, and any time a 
straw-boss came near him he just started sawing blocks. The 
boss thought he was sawing for some special purpose. He's 
making $75.00 and $100.00 a week too."   [*(19)*]
