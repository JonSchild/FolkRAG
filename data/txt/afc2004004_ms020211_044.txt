Dear Mr. Lomax:

We are interested in scheduling a series of college concerts in the upper
midwest area for Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Island Singers, during
the fall, preferably October or November, of 1964.  Will you please let us
know what three week period Miss Jones and her group would be available
during this time and what her weekly fee would be.  Of course, we would
plan to pay transportation from Minneapolis through the tour and return to
Minneapolis.

Please send us any promotional material you have available.

May we hear from you at your earliest convenience?

Sincerely,
[* James S. Lombard, Jr. *]
