Mrs. H gets a chair & two men to 
lug him in the house with - 
Well they're living on $3 county
relief [Mr. M boards with Mrs.
H.] and now the county will
send single men to the farm - 
"a hog-hole." He'll die first.
They live by making beautiful
baskets, corn husk mats, quilts
(the log cabin), rag rugs, etc., and
are devoted artisans (he showed her
how to weave the mats & helps her
lay out the quilt patterns) and 
swapping matches (of which several
examples hang by the wall). They
don't know whether they'll make out
till winter & their old age pension
