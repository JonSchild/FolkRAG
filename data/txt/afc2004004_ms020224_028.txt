BJ TAPE 9, p. 26

An' I can say for sure I ain't never been nobody's hinder.  You
know, to keep 'em out [from] the Kingdom, of God.  I'd rather go [on,]
head on, as I often tell the Lord, "If I do any thing, don't charge it
to nobody."  You know?  "Don't put it on nobody; put it me.  Let
me live myself out my own. . ." You know.
     You hear peoples say, "You suffer for So-and-so. . .You. . ."
ah, "Such-an'-such one got Such-an'-such one's sins on 'em."
But I don't want it to happen.  I don't believe it an' I don't
want it to happen.  'Cause the Lord said, "I'm gonna pay you for
what you do."  So that's why when, when I came through, I was ah,
willin' to, ah, to go through.  An' I -- you know -- [I,} I know,
I know I had worketed; I know I had laid down everything for
this purpose, to folla (follow) Jesus, an' then when he really shown up,
ya know, baptized me, an' I, an' I knew it was a diffrunt, then
I was satisfied, with what the peoples had been tellin' me.  You
know, that I couldn't do it.  "It ain't no more for ya. . .You git
converted an' that's all."
     It three.  It three; it three a you, right now, like you
stand there.  When [the] a baby's born in this worl', there's three a
him.  Ya see?  It plainly.  An' it three of, of, of, of (these
agree?).  Ya see?  The Father an' the Son an' the Holy Ghost.
All right; that, that's the ah, converted, sactfified wi' the
Holy Ghost.  An' [ya got] you baptized that Holy Ghost. . .(END OF REEL)
