Rumor reports should, if possible, describe the circumstances 
in which the rumor was repeated and the kind of person
telling it. (The actual name of the person is not important. The
analyses of the Office of War Information lead to the conclusion 
that it is unwise for a private group to attempt to track down the
"originator" of the rumor or to assign responsibility for its
spread.)

Rumor Analysis
If rumors are to serve as a barometer of information
needs, they should be classified carefully according to their content. 
The first natural division is into local and non-local types.
Local rumors are obviously those which allege unverified facts about
local groups, institutions, or problems. The classification of
local rumors will depend on the rumors which circulate in your community.

The analysis of rumors can best be done by persons trained
in the social science. local universities will generally have experts 
on their staffs who can be asked to serve on the project and 
supervise the analysis. 
Rumor analysis should indicate what rumors are being
spread, how widely, and in what circles. Such analyses reveal what
the rumor problems are, how serious they are, and toward whom information which blankets rumor must be directed.
