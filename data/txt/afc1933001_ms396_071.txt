THE OLD CHISHOLM TRAIL
  
            The Chisholm - pronounced Chizzum - Trail wandered from southwest 
Texas to the high, cold plains of Montana and Dakota, where Texas
longhorns were once driven and grazed a winter or two before being shipped 
to Chicago packing houses.

            Here in Chicago, Kansas City, Ft. Worth, and other cities, the 
cattle and hogs and sheep are converted into steaks and chops for the
Eastern markets.  The bones are made into fertilizer for the farms, the 
horns into witch-hazel and combs, the hair into brushes, the sinews and 
hoofs into glue.

               "We save everything except the dying squeal of the pig," an en-
thusiastic packer once said.
       
                 Before the days of north-to-south railroads, the cattle were 
driven from San Antonio on north over definitely planned routes. The
herd grazed each morning, before it was started up the trail, and again
in the late afternoon before it was rounded up and bedded down for the
night.
          
            A drive from Texas to Montana took several months, for the cattle
traveled only ten to fifteen miles a day.

               Plenty of grass and plenty of water along the route of the trail
were necessary.  Captain John Chisholm of Texas rode alone from Texas to 
Montana searching for the best possible route. 
 
            He came back over his own trail and then drove a herd of steers
over it. He has left a trail bearing his name, and also a trail song 
or epic that bids fair to last much longer than the dim marks of the old
cattle trail - marks that may yet to be found in the limestone hills over
