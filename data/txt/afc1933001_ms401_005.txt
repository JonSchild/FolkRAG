long deferred coming.  And many [?  ?] around
English ballads.
    A few songs were gay in tone. Most of them were dominated
by sadness. Here was no studied art. The words, the music,
the peculiar rhythm, were simple, the natural emotional out-
pouring of the black man in confinement. The listener found
himself swept along with the emotions aroused by this appeal
to primitive instinct, and, despite himself, discovered his own
body swaying in unison to the urge of Iron-Head's melodies.
    [A] [S]ix times convicted [convict], an "habitual," as he called
himself, "De roughest nigger who ever walked de streets of Dal-
las; in de pen off an' on for 34 years," according to his own
admission, Iron-Head failed to look the part. Only some deep-
ly graven and grim lines about his mouth and eyes made you stop
and wonder if any tenderness touched his life. His
massive head suggested pictures of blind Homer, with its rug-
ged overhanging brows and deep-set eyes. He had the quiet
dignity and reserve of a Roman. Amid the clamor and excitement
of a room full of black convicts, hearing for the first time
their voices coming from the recording machine, he [alone] pre-
served his gravity and composure. "You have Indian blood,"
I said; and he nodded. "Sing Shorty George, Iron-Head,"
begged his companions. And they insisted and urged his until
his quiet negative flamed into an outburst of anger:
    "You niggers know dat song always tears me to pieces. I
won't sing it." And he walked away from the crowd to the iron-
barred door where he stood leaning against the jamb, looking
out into the soft Texas moonlight. Soon he motioned to me.
