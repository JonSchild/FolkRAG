TAPE 29: SEAMUS ENNIS, JANUARY 15th, 1951. DUBLIN.
This is one of the few fairy songs we have in Ireland. I learnt
it from a woman in west Cork, and the story of the song is that
a woman was abducted by the fairies - and one day, one of the 
neighbours was washing on the washing slabs by the side of the 
river when she heard this song coming from a mound which was
behind her in a field - a fairy mound. The song gave her
instructions to give to the abducted woman's husband, which would
enable him to rescue the abducted woman from the clutches of the
fairies; and this is the way the song went in Gaelic. . . 
(SINGS " " THE WOMAN OF THE FAIRY MOUND.")
Translation: "O woman down yonder on the washing slab,
Stop your board and listen to my complaint.
A year from today I was abducted from my true love
And carried in here to the fairy mound.
Tell my husband to come here tomorrow
With a wax candle in the centre of the palm of his hand.
A black-handled knife to be carried in his hand;
And he's to strike the first horse that comes through the gap.
If he doesn't come by that time,
I will be a queen over these ladies. . . .

An amusing little one I heard in Connemara. It tells of an old
woman. Frequently they keep a little suckling pig at home in
County Dublin - I've heard my mother and father call it a shaleen - 
which is a term meaning "a little old thing." This woman missed
the pet pig from the kitchen. The pig, you se, is fed by the
bottle and becomes domesticated when it's young. And she missed
the pig from around the house this day, and as soon as she missed
it, went away out on the road and tried to find the pig. She saw
a woman - a very clever travelling woman who had purloined the
pig and placed it in the shawl on her back and carried it as
though it were a child in the shawl. The poor old woman asked had
the travelling woman seen the pig anywhere, and the travelling
woman answered in song, like this. jigging the pig on her back
in the shawl as she sang. And she christened the pig "little Dermot". . . .
SINGS: THE STOLEN PIG
Translation: Hoo-a, little Dermot, hoo-a, little Dermot,
This child on the hump of my back,
May I not have him a year from today
If I ever saw your pig, or ever had him.
Hoo-a, little Dermot, hoo-a, little Dermot.
