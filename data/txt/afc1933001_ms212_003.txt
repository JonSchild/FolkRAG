wrote to her yesterday - this time, I hope, a
more satisfactory letter than when I
was sick and could not think clearly),
with the information [I] you now got
from Macmillan we can drop that
job until much later. You make
a most sorry picture of the attitude 
of Mr. Waters, and even of Mr.
Spivacke. You will soon be in
a position where such criticisms
wont apply to you (I am including
the uppity Mr. Halpert). For me it
is different. I can understand
why they feel as they do, and there
is much to be said for their point
of view. I am to blame about 
the condition of Ballads #1, and
with Ruth's help we will clean [it]
up the book and make it worthy
of the name, so worthy that, in 
connection with Ballads #2, despite
the attitudes of Halpert, Harzog and
Co., will make it hard to supplant.
