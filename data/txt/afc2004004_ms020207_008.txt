Although His coming may be morning, night or noon,
Night or noon;

[Til] Tell He's coming at your door
So that all men may know He's coming soon.

A: Reverend, when did you compose that?
R: Oh, that's been twenty, some twenty years ago.
A: Beautiful song.  How'd you come to compose it, do you remember
the circumstances?
R: Well I don't just remember that, exactly, but I know generally I compose
my songs at night.  I'[d]ll be laying down, you know, and just thinking,
