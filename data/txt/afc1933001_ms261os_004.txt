JOHN A. LOMAZ - ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS - DALLAS TEXAS

These often stirring, sometimes powerful, songs of labor,
apparently sung only to accompany some such group labor as
track laying, driving, steel spikes, cane cutting, hoeing 
and chopping(as in felling trees, four men to a tree),
have thus far been neglected by collectors. Where it has not
been possible to make records of them out in the fields and
woods we have successfully staged groups, with axes or hoes in
hand, and secured on our records precisely the same musical
effects of concerted blows with voice Accompaniment. The singers
usually number from four to sixteen. The words of these
songs cover a side range, the music being surprisingly varied
when one considers the necessary limitations the movements of
labor make on the rhythm of the tunes.

Often skillful musicians among the negro prisoners are allowed
access to a guitar or other musical instrument to play for the
entertainment of convicts on Sundays and holidays, or to entertain
white visitors.  Now and then a band is found among the
the farm camps. Such groups formed the nuclei from which we
worked to discover singers who knew the type of songs for
which we were working -- usually run to leash at last among
the life-farmers with "little Latin and no Greek." A recent
arrival, especially if from town, is usually under the influence
of jazz and the radio and knows no ballad or folk song.
If, on the other hand, as sometimes did happen, the singer chanced
to be one who in the "free world" had belonged to the class who
wander from town to town singing for dimes on the street corners
as he twanged his guitar -- then we were indeed fortunate. Such
