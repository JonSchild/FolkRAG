   July 16th - This is the second day of the 
Bothy ballad country of Scotland. Here
Ford, Ord & Gavin Grieg have preceeded
me, not to speak of the BBC tracks.
There is absolutely no chance of recording
anything unrecorded, of saving anything 
unsaved. Old trails, old tunes, old
singers and old stuff. I'm growing 
more & more irritated. At least one
should be employed in searching out
something new & desperate to be known.
   Well. H. Henderson the poet
has brought me here. It is his ideal
of what Scotland might be, this 
fat fair land of Buchan. The
pasture so fat, the meadows so
verdant that the shiny black
cattle [skip] [?] and run about like
goats. Most cows I've known 
have been sad, miserable or at
least melancholy creatures.
