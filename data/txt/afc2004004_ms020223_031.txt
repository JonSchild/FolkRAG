BJ TAPE 7D. p. [28]29

Sure does. I look at it some time myself, that way. An' I seen peoples,
ah, [comin' out of a] come in our church an' before you couldn't hardly hear
'em? You know, they weren't, you know, they jus' didn't, but they
was... I readin' this a while ago. About how ya, how, how he [they]
was bound to (be?) saved for sin. They had [this, the] to, to (be jerked ?) 
around by Satan; was (a deacon?) [but] what he had to do. So the Lawd could,
you know, make a new creature outcha (out of you) then? It's jus'
everything. He said, "Behold, I place in you a new song." No
doubt that voice is changed, or do sumpin'. No change, but-- I 
don't know what it do; it do sumpin to ya.
     An' but you, you're right. [It] They oh, seems to like them deacons
have the best ol' -- especially the good ones, ya know? -- the
best ol' tune. An' they can raise those hymns so good. And they
have tho-- In the Baptist Church, they still havin' it: One git
down an' pray now, an' then they get up an' sing some more hymns,
an' ah [you know], a hymn or two, or either if not that they may catch a
song in it now, between, you know... An' they, then after that,
then they'll-- just prob'ly one or another get down an' pray.
An' that like that, you know at a time.
     But see, we don't have it, ya see. We just prays in concert.
Ya see. We does. An' they all...
AL: You do?
BJ: Yeah, we pray in concert. Af-after we sing...
AL: What does that mean, exactly? 
BJ: Jus' all go down in prayer. Every one bow to the altar to
to the seats, you know? An' every one pray one time, everybody.
It's jus' like in the day of Pentacost: Everybody git on one
accord an' pray. One time.
AL: Pray Out loud?
