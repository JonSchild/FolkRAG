II - ANTI-INFLATION

Agenda for meeting, Saturday, August 29, 11:00 AM

1. Summary of data. This is now urgently needed 
by Mr. Schecter, the new campaign coordinator, 
who would like it if possible in the form of 
a master chart. 

2. The proposed poll. Since possible policy changes 
may not occur for nearly a month, it seems advisable 
to proceed with this poll without further 
delay. 

Needed for this discussion: Messrs. Franzen, Stanton, 
Horowitz, Likert, Wilson, Barth, Dunston. 

Copy to: Messrs. DuBois, Woodward, Wilson, Gaudet, 
Johnson, Likert, Dunston, Beals, Winkler, Pettee, 
Hawkins, Katz, Warner, Horowitz, Hilgard, Franzen, 
Stanton.
