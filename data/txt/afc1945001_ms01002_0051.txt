Dear Mr. Langer:

Your letter of February 25 - for which I really want to thank
you - came in time so that I can send directly to you another
suggestion aimed directly at the prevention of the spread of
rumors. 

Without going into the need for something like my suggestion
proposes - which need is obvious, I suggest that the federal
government set up a plan for holding Propaganda Clinics in
every town and city in the United States, with the Clinics
starting in the federal departments where, as President Roosevelt
indicates, many rumors start. 

These Propaganda Clinics would train the people to

1.  Recognize propaganda.
2.  Trace it to its general source (trace it mentally).
3.  Check its spread.
4.  Demonstrate dramatically how propaganda starts,
how it grows, and what effects it creates.

The press and the radio would cooperate in an orderly program
like this and, through their cooperation, they would learn
in the process the effects they are responsible for in
the quick and constant communication of news and opinion
to the general public.

The working out of this idea would enlist the assistance of
the people and would, like the idea for an Official Answerer
of Rumors, give them something to do instead of asking them
to refrain from doing something.  These two ideas, Propaganda
Clinics and the Answering of Rumors, worked out together could, 
I believe, do much to control, check and kill many of the
rumors that now cause so much trouble and lost time.

The attached very rough diagrams are examples of the methods
by which, pictorially and by dramatic physical demonstration,
the Propaganda Clinics would train the people to censor 
news for themselves, to apply more alert judgment to opinion, 
and to seek a verification in every statement that is made to
them.
