Dear Mr. Lomax:
O.K. about the Ledford story then -- just 
so that the final implications are not anti-New 
Deal. Length, however, should not be more 
than 5,000 words.  In a quarterly we just can't 
go beyond that. 
Cordially, 
Frank Mlakar

P.S. It would be preferable if you could keep the 
length down to around 4,000 words, but I guess it 
is the material which will really dictate the length 
for you.
