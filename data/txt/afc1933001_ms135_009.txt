Mr. William Schlecht,
3024 Wisconsin Ave., N.W.,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Bill:

Thanks for your delightful letters of
introduction. I very much needed contacts in
both Minneapolis and Duluth, and the Dingum
Shop crowd and Cal Harrison sound delightful.

Where in the world is Cal Crosshaul,
the lumberjack who hasn't shown up in Washington?
Is he handling a peavey on the Kennebec?
Please send me his address or his route and I
will try to catch him.

Yours gratefully,

Alan Lomax
