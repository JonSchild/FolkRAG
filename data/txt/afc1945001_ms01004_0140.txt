Dear Miss Engle:

This is just an advance note to tell you that
memoranda on rumors are pouring in from a great many
Federal Security Agency field offices -- and also to 
tell you how much we appreciate your help in this matter.

Categorizing all of the ideas represented in
the rumors is going to take us considerable time, but
we promise you a look at the result when it is completed.

Sincerely yours,


Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
