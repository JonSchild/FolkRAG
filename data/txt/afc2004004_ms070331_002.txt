The China Town Gun Boat
Sung to the tune of The Strawberry Roan, 
by Stormy, an old salt & guitar player who 
sails on the government boat, S.S. Hyacinth 
out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Given to 
me by Archie [Laft] Lafreniere.

I was cruising down Sand street on one summer night
When a full rigged damsel, she hoved into sight,
Now I ask her where bound and she came along side
Like a Chinatown gunboat going out with the tide.

So I paid out my hawser and I took her in tow,
And we cruised up the street as a couple should
Now we tacked for an alley, twas not very neat
And we moored fore and aft at the end of the street

Now from doorway to doorway and just as before
Up three flights of stairs where she laid me oer
Now she clewed up her corsets and her red flag hailed
And she laid her two white hands on my two pendes fail
