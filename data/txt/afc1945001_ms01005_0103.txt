off in ten years?"  is a question properly placed or rhetorically placed.
If the latter, we would be justified in including it in rumor study.
   Rumor carries with it the implication, if not the fact of a private
source of information.  The private source may be designated; for
example, the wife of an Admiral, or a letter from Cousin Joe, or an
important official who really knows, or a newspaper man who, of course,
can't print the story.  Sometimes no source is given. Where no source
is given we would still be justified in including such material in
rumor study.  Where a person specifically says, "I read in this morning's
Daily Call," or "I heard over the radio," or "the newsreel showed,"
we have a reference back to a common source of information. 
Even though it would be exceedingly difficult to verify some
of the references used, theoretically it would be possible, and actually
when such a source is given, people are in a position to challenge the
information.  However, when no source is given or [referred to] private resources
[imply them] implied or referred to, people are put in the [upper] awkward position of being unable to
check up on the facts as reported.
   For purposes of our study, rumor may be specific or general in
reference.  It may refer to a particular person, a special place, an
industry, a racial group, a nation, a continent.  We cannot at this
stage permit ourselves to limit rumor study to particular anecdotes
or details about specific people or places.  We must take as our point
of departure for this sort of study the importance of the material that
we are dealing with rather than traditional conceptions of what a rumor
is.  We are interested in studying people's attitudes, information, beliefs,
and feelings about the war, and from the original study valuable  material
seems to be coming in in all forms.  Therefore, for the present we will
use the broader definition.
