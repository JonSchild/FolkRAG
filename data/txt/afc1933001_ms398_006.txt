The little boy cutting up dry brush into short sticks for kindling 
wood looked up at me as I came to a cabin in the Bandera Mountains west 
of San Antonio, Texas. 

"Yes-sir, my father is at home," he replied to my question. Marvin 
Hunter had told that Elmo Newcomer could fiddle more cowboy breakdowns 
in genuine cowboy style than any other man who lived in this eddy
of civilization framed by the surrounding hills. There stood Elmo in 
the doorway, a spare, typical mountaineer.

"I'm John Lomax"--I began.

"The feller who got up the cowboy songs?" he interrupted. When I 
assented, without another word he led me to a corner of the room where 
he had nailed in a triangular small pine shelf. On this shelf, making 
a pile four or five inches thick, lay a first edition of Cowboy Songs 
and Other Frontier Ballads. No two leaves were fastened together, 
though the entire book was there, even the introductory pages and the
half covers, stained from the touch of many hands.

"That's my library. My children have been raised on them songs. 
The neighbors have worn the book out, always borrowing it.

"Nearly thirty years ago a boy friend and I read about this book 
in the Texas Cattleman. We cut and sawed wood for money to pay for it. 
Then we he moved away I bought his share. Won't you have a chair. 

Until near midnight Elmo Newcomer, surrounded by his family, part 
of the time with a baby on his lap, drew magic music with him homely 
fiddle and flying bow. In between bars he would shout out cattle calls, 
imitate the cries of a panther or the whoops of wild Apaches. His dance 
calls, also interspersed with the music, gave directions in rhymed couplets.
