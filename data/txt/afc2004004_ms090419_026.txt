Asa Ward--the foolish boy.     [*Cut*]

Hit was a preacher once was visiting one of his deacons,
and this deacon had a little boy--he was a foolish kid. His mama
told him, "Son, I'm gonna have company here now, " says, "I want
you to act nice." Say, "You know you is a fool."

Boy say, "Yassum!"

So the preachers was sitting there in the house and the
little boy was in the corner. He was studying, reading. Way after
while, one of the preachers looked over there and said, "Boy, what's
your name?" He didn't say nothing. Another preacher said, "Aw, leave
him alone. You see he's a fool." Little boy begin to holler, "Yow-
yow-yow-yow." His mama just come running, say, "Son,what's the matter?
What's the metter?" He said, "Moma, these folks found me out at last."
