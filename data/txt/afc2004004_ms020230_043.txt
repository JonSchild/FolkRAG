TL:     What was the inside of those little shacks like where so 
many people were?
BJ:     Oh, well, they jus', [they] hit was like that, I'm tellin' ya. It was jes' 
a crowd - Ah, I don't know how, I don't know how a jailhouse look inside, 
but I, I will know, I b'lieve that was jus' lak it.   Hah, I'm 
tellin' ya.   Us was piled up in there an'. . . But they all got along 
all right.   Everybody piled their clothes un-under the cots, an' 
hang 'um up an' . . . Nobody seemed to bother nobody's stuff, you 
know. They jus' . . .An' they -- 'Cause the do's was open all the 
time.   'Cause there were some children a-amongst 'em, ya know? 
In that way.  An' so the do's was open all the time. Nobody 
bothered nobody's things.

TL:     All different families?
BJ:     No, no. Some don't ain't never seen one another. They jus' 
peoples workin', comin' in to work. An' you let 'em in because 
th- - everybody's on the hawg.  You know, everybody's a worker. 
An' sometimes they'll find -- if you find -- when you fine, you can get another  
room over yonder, somewhere, over there, somewhere, why, they'll
pull out, that way. And find it.
         If the peoples see there's too many peoples crowded up an' 
soon as they can get a, a [g] break, why they build a few mo' lil' 
huts. That's all. An' line 'em up together.  One-room huts.  It's 
always one-room huts, ya see.  Ya sleep -- wh,-- wh-when I git out
