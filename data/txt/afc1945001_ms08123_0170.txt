A Gunner's Vow

I wished to be a pilot
and you along with me.
But if we all were pilots
Where at would the Air Force be?
It takes "Guts" to be a Gunner
To sit out in the tail
when the Messerschmitts are coming
And the shuys begin to wail
The pilot's Just a chauffer.
It's his Job to fly the plane.
But we do all the fighting.
Though we may not get the Fame:
If we all must  be gunners.
Then let us make this bet
We'll be the best darn [damn] Gunners
That have left this station yet.
