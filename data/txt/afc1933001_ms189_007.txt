4.

me the story of the early days in New Orleans, [his early connection
with jazz] of how jazz outgrew the town and moved up the river to
New Orleans. Charles Smith, the editor of the two most important books
in the field, says that this body of manuscript in the most important
single [docuent] document in the history of jazz. I want to present the
story of Jelly in his own mad language. It is the story of a son who
"[runined] runined his eyes looking for marks on cards under strong lights",
who " made a hundred dollars a night in tips at [Queenie] Queenie's place
in 1908," "who is the King of jazz and stomps."

The burden of the book might be summed up this way. It is our
democratic right to speak to the president and we ordinary Americans
speak a language as eloquent and beautiful and distinctive and
many-colored as any great writer ever wrote. I expect to make the material
move out a more or less personal narrative of my own connection with
and impressions of these peoples. And I am going to have time this spring
to work on the book. I want to do it very badly. I hope you'll take
it. Let me hear from you.

Yours,
Alan Lomax
