Of Special Interest To All Kansas People —

I have just finished writing a very interesting study dealing with
Dr. Brewster Higley's beautiful poem - 'Home On The Range' - now the Kansas
state official melody. The Title:
      
STUDIES IN POETICAL ART AND SACRED LITERATURE
IN HONOR OF THE UNKNOWN POET —
DR. BREWSTER HIGLEY
BY CLYDE L. BARR

Featuring Dr. Brewster Higley's Beautiful Poem -
HOME ON THE RANGE with
Symbolic, Mythical, Mystical, Poetical and Biblical Interpretations.
                                 
Nothing like it. This is the first time such a study of the unknown
poet and his grand poem has been undertaken. It was written especially
for students and lovers of poetry, art, music and sacred literature. It
contains a very choice variety of sacred and poetical thought. I am sure
you will find it extremely interesting, powerfully uplifting, and highly
educational.
I have mailed a copy of the 'Studies' to the Smith County Pioneer,
Smith Center, Kansas, to see if they can find time and space to publish it.
The poem - 'Home On The Range' was written in a little log shanty near 
Smith Center, and first published in the Smith County Pioneer in 1873.
If interested in these 'Studies' write to the Smith County Pioneer and
tell them you are interested in the 'Home on The Range' 'Studies' and if
they are published you would like to have a copy.

Tell all your Kansas friends about it.
Mail this announcement to someone.

Sincerely yours,
Clyde L. Barr
