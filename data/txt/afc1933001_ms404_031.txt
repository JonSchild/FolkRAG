began the local "leader," and the group sang
a swinging spiritual, 
"Lord, I want to love my enemies in my heart
Lord, I want to be more humble in my heart"
Then he invites the "sinner friends" to come 
forward to the front seats. No one moved
from his more comfortable [bed?]. 
"Those that mourn shall be comfortable.
Let us mourn," added the leader 
no [words?]. Only waves of sound, deep and
poignant, moans of [?]  woe,
swept the gloomy building. The silence 
grew deeper after this "mourning" 
period. 
The leader said that 
"thousands and thousands [?]  [multiplied?] 
by thousands [?] [?] off from the golden 
opportunities" his [?]  were enjoying, 
and then the crowd sang a song," 
"wasn't that a mighty storm that blew people away."
