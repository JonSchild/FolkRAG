6) O the mate, he whacked me round and round, 
I wish I was all ,safe and sound. 

7) O when we got to Frisco docks, 
The girls were rolling in their frocks.

Haul on the Bowline: 

1) Haul on the bowline before she starts a-rolling, 
Haul on the bowline, a bowline-ho ! 
Haul on the bowline, the skipper he's a growling, 
Haul on the bowline, a bowline-ho ! 

2) Haul on the bowline so early in the morning. . . . 

3) . . . .To Frisco we are going. . . . . 
4) . . . .Kitty is me darling.

A-Roving: 

1) In Amsterdam there lived a maid, 
Mark well what I do say. 
In Amsterdam there lived a maid 
Who was always pinching a sailor's pay. 
I'll go no more a-roving with you fair maid. 
A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ru-i-in, 
I'll go no more a roving with you fair maid. 

2) I took this maiden for a walk, 
She wanted some gin and didn't she talk. 

3) I gave this miss a parting kiss, 
When I got aboard my money I missed.
