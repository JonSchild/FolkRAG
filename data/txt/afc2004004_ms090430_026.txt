because very seldom does it include anything other than food. It is under 
this type of furnishing that the more common types of exploitation take place. 
The third type of furnishing is that arrangement under which the amount is not stipulated. This is the "account" system where the tenant purchases at his 
own discretion.

Tenants in many of these Counties were [*are*] furnished chiefly on the limit plan. 
The Knowlton plantation allowed a tenant family "one dollar per month for 
each acre in cotton in groceries and drygoods plua a few extras such as doctor's 
and other services." Token money, which can be used as exchange only 
at the Knowlton stores, is given the tenant every two weeks. On the Wooten 
plantation and several others the amount of furnishing is established according 
to the size of the family. The Delta and Pine Lands Company makes 
its advances according to the acreage in cultivation.

geographic and occupational. The farm owner has made an investment which 
he cannot easily relinquish without loss. The tenant is free to seek new

However, the tenant is usually financially unable to travel great 
distances. Many tenants change locations frequently, but in the course of 
a lifetime never get more than ten miles from the first farm they tilled.
