The Method to be Tried
If this method proves itself in the pre-test, three interviewers will work
for two weeks in each city. They will become participant observers seeking
for data which will be particularly susceptible to qualitative analysis.
At the outset a "commando" technique will be used for the purpose of getting
in touch with representative individuals and families. the cooperation
of these individuals and families will then be sought to the end of
using them as channels of information. The selection will be the same in
both cities along some such plan as the following:
banker
lawyer
doctor
Service club president [*barber*]
policeman
bartender
restaurant keeper
merchant
clerk-stenographer
skilled workman
unskilled workman
minister, priest, rabbi
ect., etc.
The problem of sampling for this study has been discussed with Steve
Stock and he feels that some such method as this should be used.
Those individuals and families will be taken into the study as participants.
Different icebreaking and rapport building techniques will of course have
to be tried out but we are assuming that this will be one of the lesser
problems. These informants will be visited several times during the interviewing
period and will pass on to the interviewer information relevant
to the study. This will consist of such data as the following:
1. Reports of rumors.
2. What people are circulating rumors.
3. Where the rumors probably started.
4. The extent to which people believe in them.
5. The elements in the rumors which do, or do not, make for
credibility.
The interviewer will be able, on the basis of such intimate contact with
his informants, to come to some degree of understanding as to the function
and significance [*of rumor*] in the individual case and thus to different types and
classes of people. He will use rough rating scales in evaluating whatever
pertinent personality characteristics may be involved in the individual
diagnoses. The interviewer will thus collect sufficient information about
