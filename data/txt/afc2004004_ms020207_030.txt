Reverend Roe.  Reel 9.  P. 5.
And they said the first child were mine, and the just carried it around, [you know.] here until lots of people just believed it; my deacons all believed it.  They went to her, and asked and she said, "Why, he never had anything to do with me."  And they had no proof [or nothing] and, of course, and they couldn't do anything about it and finally the child was born, and when the child was born, why, it was so unlike myself un-til they just couldn't say any more, and it all just died.  And now she's one of the best workers in the church.
A:  Did you have to come up and discuss it in public in meetings?  
[In other words] You never were accused in public actually in the church.
[*another accusation*]
R:  Well, yes, yes, I was.  it got so here one time til I had to have a meeting, and I had the meeting and I just had [the] a deacon[s] to set as the moderator.  And I told the church, "Now I want every one of you in here to be honest, [and] if you ever knowed anything wrong about me [any more] and any woman I want you to come up and tell it."  They just sit there; didn't nobody said a word because [it wasn't anything] they didn't know anything, and finally it was a man - he's here now - he stood up.  "Yeah?"  I asked him what.  And he said, "Well, I just wanted to say that this woman that the pastor been accused of," he says, "I've been going with her myself, and at the times when they said the pastor was with this woman, I was with her myself, and I know that the thing they [said] say is not true."
A:  Well, did that cause this woman to be driven out of the church?
R:  No sir, she stayed right here and worked, and she's here now, one of the 
best workers.
A:  But wouldn't she be accused in the church of having sinned, if she had the child without being married?
R:  Shemarried the man after she'd gotten that way, you know, she married the man [done] and the another child by her.  She got two children now by 
the man and then he left and went to California, and he didn't provide 
for her and didn't care for her [the way ] as he should have and so she divorced him not more
