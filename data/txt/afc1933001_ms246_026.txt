Dear Alan:  With proper encouragement
from you and your superiors
I believe on my trip in the West that
I could secure an recordings from 
old time cattlemen and trail drivers
[a unique amount of] material for 
an album of unique experiences of western
cattle drivers, their talk not mine
of conditions and adventures in 
the early days of the Southwest.
All of this stuff will be gone
in the limbo of forgetfulness 
if the records are not made
now. 
But I must wait for 
your approval before I drive
myself into making the effort
to get to the men that can
record this material.  With 
all my heart to you 
Father
