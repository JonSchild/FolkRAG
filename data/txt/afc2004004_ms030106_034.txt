1646A.       35
Well, after that why-uh he shot the policeman, as I [before] stated, see,
and killed him. And seemingly that Robert Charles must have been
a marksman. It was later learned that Robert Charles made all of his own bullets
and had a couple of barrel of bullets, barrels of em [I mean], and every time he
would raise his rifle, when a policeman was in sight, there'd be a policeman
dead. It was never learned how many policemens were killed. Some said
thirty two, some said 18 and so forth and so on. They had different numbers
that was stated in the police department or the papers. Robert Charles
was very orderly-seeming to everybody, never had any trouble before,
but this arose him to fury and, through this killin', [there] it started
the great N.O. riot. People, innocent people of all kinds were killed. Robert
Charles lived in a little bitty small shack-like. There was another
one right next to his, I would say twin houses. It was stated from time
to time that this building was burned down in order to get R. C. out,
but, I can assure, I was there when it all happened and I was there when it
all stopped. There was no burning, but I think it was smoked, in order
to get this gentleman out. After the riot there has [was] never been anything
of authenticity where R.C. had been captured. It was learned later
years that he had gotten sick or something happened to him and he was
supposed to have confessed that he was the R. C. He also had a friend
with him at that time that wanted to betray him. I think this man were
killed. In fact I am sure that he was. And that [This] was the end of R.C.. They had
a song out on R.C. Like many other songs and many other bad men they alway
had some kind of a song that somebody originated on them. But this song 
was squshed very easily by the department and, not only by the deoartment,
by any of the surrounding people that ever heard the song, due to the fact
that it was a trouble breeder and it never did get [any further] very far.
