The Government is giving $160,000 to open up nurseries to take
care and educate and give meals to the children of men and women working
in defense plants, when they can afford to pay for someone to come in and
take care of their children.

It certainly looks funny for soldiers to sacrifice their lives
while defense workers are making big salaries at home. [*1-7a*]

The Army and Navy gives big businessmen and big executives
commissions, whereas the workers in railroad offices and stores who are [*1*]
just as qualified can't get commissions.

Here's a department store manager. He has plenty to support his
family with, and he becomes a major. I know an office worker who is as
good as that manager, maybe better, and he has to serve as a private. [*1*]
That's unfair.

The unions control all defense jobs. It should not be necessary 
in time of war to pay the union to get a job.

30,000 Jews are let into this country every year. Just because the
Jews are chased out of foreign countries is no reason why they should be
let in here.

The Government will crack down on the people and let them know 
there is a war, but it won't be until after the election.
