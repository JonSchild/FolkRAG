Dear Alan: I think your bibliography
of folk lore and folksong
excellent except for the ex
cathedra and cocky tone of the
pithily phrased summaries. Carl
Sandburg, for example, who has been with me
for two days, was downright offended
on reading the pamphlet
because he said that thousands of
people have found his Songbag
a singing book. The dreadful
truth is that the first year's
sale of his Songbag reached 8000
copies, a far greater market than
will ever be reached by a book
entitled American Ballads and
Folk Songs, a better book
I shall continue to maintain.
