for Mrs. Tartt of Alabama. How
much time did you spend
with her? And did you see
any of my Negro friends?

About a machine again.
Mr. Spivacke when I last
saw him indicated that
it would be most convenient
to send me a machine
during the winter months.
I'll use one as much as
possible whenever you have
it to spare.

Thank you for your
help.
Affectionately,
Father
