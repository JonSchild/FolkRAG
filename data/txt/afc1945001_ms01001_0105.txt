Sometimes desire to be authoritative and complete leads to
a complexity of presentation in the course of which the nub of the
argument is overlooked and the following illustrates there is still no 
answer to the rumor, we still don't know the scrap rubber will 
be used.

"RUMOR--Much of the scrap rubber recently collected will
never be used.
"FACT--In last Sunday's Rumor Clinic, John I. Taylor, Jr,
of the Conservation Department, New England Regional
Office, WPB, 17 Court Street, Boston, pointed out that so
much of this scrap rubber still is seen in piles about
New England because reclamation plants, even though now
processing scrap rubber at the rate of one ton every
minute, will be working the remainder of this year before they can utilize all the scrap collected.  The rumor has
been more widespread than was at first apparent and now
from Mr. Taylor's office comes this further information:
'In practically every case the scrap rubber piles are being
held for disposal of the government.  Representatives of
WPB, all of them thoroughly experienced in the scrap rubber
business, are inspecting scrap yards belonging to leading 
dealers in every section of the country.  Their reports
indicate that nearly 100 percent of the dealers so far
visited have either sold or agreed to sell their whole 
stock of rubber scrap to the rubber company of the RFC,
and to start the scrap on its way to rubber reclaiming
plants as soon as the Rubber Reserve Company issues shipping
instructions.  Dealers have been told by the Rubber Reserve Company not to load freight cars until full shipping instructions 
have been received.  As a consequence many scrap
piles now belonging to the government remain unmoved in
dealers' yeards."

The next pair does not even try to answer the rumor.  It starts an 
argument, [that] offers no fact, and finishes at [with what seems to be] a 
[very] low level [of argument].

"RUMOR--The country will be so upset by all this conversion
to war industry that we'll never get back to normal."
Intent: To make Americans dread the aftermath of war so 
much that they'll not fight well.
