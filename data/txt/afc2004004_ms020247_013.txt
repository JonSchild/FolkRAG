I WISHT I HAD WINGS LIKE NORA'S DOVE

I wisht I
Had wings like Nora's dove,
Lawd, I wisht I
Had wings like Nora's dove
Oh, I wisht I,
Wisht I,
Lawd, I wisht I,
Wisht I,
Yes, I wisht I
Had wings like Nora's dove,

I wisht I
Was one of the members, too, etc.

I wisht I 
Could play on David's harp, etc.

I wisht I
Had wings like Nora's dove, etc.

I'd fly away
To heaven and be at rest, etc.

I wisht I 
Had wings like Nora's dove, etc.
