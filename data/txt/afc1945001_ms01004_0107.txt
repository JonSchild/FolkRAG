Rumor Project

Orientation

Because of its direct relationship to information policy and because of the interest expressed by the Director in this approach to the problem, the rumor project for September 1st is considered as an attempt to learn the relationship between amount of news and amount of rumors.

There are obviously many other important aspects of the rumor problem - for example, (a) varying susceptibility to rumors of different socio-economic, educational, age, occupation and geographical groups and (b) varying effectiveness of different types of rumors - but theme and others which have been proposed appear to be subordinate concepts in this particular study. Some material on these subordinate topics will appear if the study is executed as proposed in the following outline, but it is submitted that they should not be the primary concerns of the project. 

Outline

To get at the rumors themselves in order to determine what, if any, relationship exists between the presence or absence of news and the prevalence of rumors, the following procedures are proposed:- 

(a) Reporting of overheard rumors by CGR field staff members from thirty-one areas

(b) Reporting of overheard rumors by listening posts in Boston, Chicago, Wichita, Cleveland 

(c) Special study by Surveys Division among various income and occupational groups in a specific area (Baltimore or Philadelphia or some other war industry city)

(d) Reporting of rumors by correspondence panels 

(e) Reporting of rumors overheard by Polls and Surveys field staff as encountered by them in the course of their regular travel
