Dear Miss Denham:

I heard so much about you in Pont Beudet and
Port-au-Prince that I feel I almost know you. Cecile
and Theoline and Ciceron and Dr. Reiser all
seemed to think you were the only anthropologist
and the only real collector who ever came to Haiti.
And I have been anxious to write you for some time
wondering if the Archive's records, three hundred of
which I made in Haiti, would be of any use to you.

Reiser told me that you were doing a Haitian
ballet and if that is still the case I should like
to lend a helping hand - that is, if my records would
do any good. Besides, I would like to know anyone who
has been to Haiti since I shall need some little advice
in preparing and translating the song texts for the
Haitian records. And the more I can find out about
the little Pont Beudet hounfort at Le Roux, the happier
I shall be. You can imagine my problem, I suppose.
Having been warned away from any personal participation
in cult activities, I never had my hand washed
as I believe you did and so was never given a great deal
of "big secret". The langage is a particularly bitter
thorn in my side at present. Old Ti Cousin offered to
teach me all the langage he knew for a hundred dollars
but I thought the price was a little excessive. Besides,
I didn't know how far I could trust the old man
himself.

Have you published any material so far that has to
do with Haiti? If so, I am most anxious to get my hands
on it. And a letter from you would be most welcome.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
