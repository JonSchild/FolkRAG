Free Defense Program

The Archive of American Folk Song can, I believe, make an
important contribution to the morale program of Conscription Camps
and of the Defense Commission, in general. It has become increasingly
evident that America's major musical contribution lies in
her folk songs of which there is a very large, rich and diversified
store.  Folk Songs and Folk Tales have been created at every stage
of American History and are intimately connected with the development
of regions, migrations, professions, and with the amusements,
sorrows and deep feelings of the American people. Taken altogether,
this lore is the music of American Democracy, the people's own collection,
descriptive of American Democracy.

The objective of this program will be to make this material
available in the camps in its native, salty and lusty condition.
It will prove successful entertainment stuff.  It will serve to reawaken
in the minds of the conservatives an interest in the experiences
of their own people in Democracy.  It will provide a great
variety of simple literary and musical forms on which the conscripts
may build their own ballads, songs and stories.  It will stimulate
the conscriptees to recall and develop for their own use, folk songs,
ballads, stories, and games of their own people. It may serve as the
basis of the development of a real singing democratic army.
