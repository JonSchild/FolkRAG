Dear Mr. Spivacke :  You hold two 
reports, the original and duplicate, of 
my trip to Abilene, Pecos ([??t] El Paso)
way. Some of that material I wish 
to include in my Adventures. You 
will recall that you complimented me
on it and I wrote back saying that 
Miss Terrill did the job. Later, after I 
suppose, you forgot and asked 
for another report. Then I forwarded 
you the duplicate. I need one copy 
now desperately. See if it can be 
found, please.

As to paying bills the new rules 
must make such action illegal unless 
the bill is at least 6 months old. Remember 
that I waited a year and three 
months for one payment. I hope your 
prophecy of early relief works out.

Yours always, John A. Lomax
