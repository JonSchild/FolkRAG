Dear Allen:

Immediately upon receipt of your letter which came to me yesterday,
I instructed our Shipping Department to try to get out the records
to your various friends. I hope they all went forward yesterday,
but they are so busy now that I can't even ask them to take time
out to report back. They will all be billed to you at a discount of
40% from list prices with charges for packing and postage.

I would like to offer you a recording contract covering a year with
a loyalty of one cent a side to you for performance. I have in mind
three specific sets of records I would like to have you make and 
perhaps, there will be others. They will involve at least 18 sides.
Please let me hear from you on this, and if you are interested, I 
will have a formal contract drawn up.

Very truly yours,
[*R.P. Wetherald*]
