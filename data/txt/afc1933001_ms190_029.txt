Dear Woody:

     Enclosed is a copy of all them nice words
Alan said about you to Haygood of Rosenwald. Thought 
you might like to see it.

     Fill out the enclosed application blanks and
mail them air mail pronto to Rosenwald fund, as time is
short and of the essence.

     Alan was glad to see your letter. It was nice,
and short, and certainly to the point.

     Didja ever get my package? Just thought I'd 
ask.

     Best regards.

(For Alan)
