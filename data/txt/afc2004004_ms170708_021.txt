5.
As they were a-sailing down Robin Hood Bay,
A gale came down up them an' dismal was the day;
A gale came down all on them an; the sea like lions roar,
An' it cast these poor sailors all on a lee shore.

As they were a-swimming, a-swimming for their lives,
Some of them had sweethearts an' some of them had wives,
A very sade misfortune, for it was that poor man's lot
In stead of bein' a married man a watery grave he got.

As soon as this sad news it reached this fair maid's ear,
She wrang her fingers an' tore off her hair.
Cryin', "Oh, you cruel billows, come toss my love on shore,
So I may behold his sweet features once more."

As she was a'walkin' down by the seaside,
She saw her own true loved one come floatin' by the tide;
As soon as she saw him, immediately did stand,
For his knew it was her own true love by the mark on his right hand.

She quickly jumped in after him an' dragged him on the shore,
She hugged him, she kissed him, ten thousand times an' more.
She hugged him an' kissed him an' then laid by his side,
And the very next day morning this fair young maid she died.
