Lomax: But you didn't know that men and women made love and all that?

Jean: Oh no. I really didna understand. She didna put it in a way that
you would understand. You know this --I'm 45 years of age and there's
some children at school would learn me yet. We was brought up very
ignorant of anything like that. But nevertheless, it did us all the
good in the world. I'm 45 and I never was in a dance hall in my life.
I never was once - and remember, I was brought up in a big city all
the days of my life -and I was never once in a dance hall.

Lomax: Because your mother thought it was sinful?

Jean: No - my mother wasna so bad. My step-father. He believed that
all evil was caused at dance halls. He brought us up that way, and
that was the way it was. He was an old soldier and he saw a lot of
life. He was overseas some time. He learnt a lot more than I did, and
he let us see right from wrong....and he wouldn't do us any harm.

Lomax: And your mother then never did explain the facts of life
to you ? When you were a girl ?

Jean: No, she didn't.

Lomax: She didn't sit you down and tell you all about how everyt[h]ing
happened ?

Jean: No, she never told us, What we learned, we just picked up. It
come to us just natural. That's God's trut .
