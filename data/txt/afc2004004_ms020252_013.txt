A CHARGE TO KEEP I HAVE

CHORUS:                      (
A charge                       (    (2)
To keep I have,             (
 A God to glorify.               (REPEAT CHORUS)

A charge to keep I have,
A God to glorify,
An' every dyin' soul to save
An' fit it for the stars.           (CHORUS)

I would not live a liar,
I'll tell you what I would do,
I'd bow down at the altar,
An' pray 'till I come through.    (CHORUS)

Oh, when I was in darkness,
An' I didn't have no light,
King Jesus is the master,
An' he brought me in this light.   (CHORUS, TWICE)

Oh, one day I was prayin',
I met ol' Satan there,
He tried to deceive me,
Sayin' there wasn't no need to be prayin'.   (CHORUS, TWICE)

Oh, when I was a sinner,
A sinner just like you,
I bowed down at the alter,
Stayed there 'till I come through.    (CHORUS, TWICE)
