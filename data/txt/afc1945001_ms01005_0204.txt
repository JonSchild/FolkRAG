if you wanted to look at it that
way, but most times a reporter is
a reporter whenever and wherever
there's a story and this was a story.

"Lady," he said, leaning over, "excuse
me for eavesdropping. I
didn't mean to. But I'm a reporter
for The Tennessean and I just
heard that story about the letter.
And I'd like to know the name of 
the lady who got the letter--could
you tell me?"

The lady was very nice and didn't
take offense at the unintended 
eavesdropping, but she was sorry
she couldn't tell him any more than
she'd already told. Seems another
woman called her mother and told 
her. No, she didn't want to tell
her mother's name and the lady
who'd called her mother was an
old lady--she was highly nervous
--and she wouldn't give her name,
either. Nor would the lady give
her own name--she didn't want to
get mixed up in a story. Her
mother hadn't slept all night after
she heard that story. The lady

was nice about it, but firm--she
wouldn't tell anything else.
__________
And It Is Told Again
Then a lady told us about it.
Seems that a man had told her, and
this man said he knew the woman
who'd received the letter. It was
terrible that such a thing could
happen. We agreed it was terrible,
but for a different reason. Terrible
that such a story should appear
to be gaining such circulation.
So we tried to locate the lady
who knew the mother--but couldn't
find her.
__________
Mother Located - No Letter
Right after that, the story began
breaking out like wildfire.
Another reporter got a telephone
call the next morning. It was a
man calling.
"Look," said the man, "I just
heard a story you ought to know
about. It's an awful story and I
don't know what you'll think, but
seems to me the paper ought to
know about it."
Then he told the story about the
letter. The letter from a Japanese
prison camp to a Nashville woman.
And the letter telling how well the
boy was being treated, etc., and
then it said, "Be sure to keep this
stamp for my collection." The
mother thought that was strange,
because her son didn't have a stamp
__________
collection. So she steamed off the
stamp and there was the message.
Did the man know the name of
the boy and mother? The reporter
of course expected the man to say
no, he didn't, but for the first time,
the answer was yes. He knew the
name of the mother and the boy 
and where the mother lived.
The reporter checked the clipping
files to see if there was anything
about such a boy being in the army
or navy. Sure enough, there was a
story. Not only that, the boy had
been captured. With no further delay,
the reporter hired a taxi and
went to see the mother.

Two Letters, Nothing Unusual
He asked if she had heard from
her boy. Yes, she said, she had.
She had received two letters from
amateur radio operators who had
picked up short wave radio broadcasts
from Tokyo, the kind that
have been sent from many men
captured at Wake and Guam, saying
her son was alright.
Had she received a letter directly
from her son? No, she hadn't.
Had the letter she received said
anything about the stamps, anything
unusual? No they were just
plain stamps. And both letters said
the same thing - her boy was well
and she was happy to know it, having
been worried about him as any
mother would since he'd been reported
captured. That was all she'd
heard from her son. (Of course the
reporter didn't repeat the story to
the mother, but he definitely established
she was not the one who'd
received THE letter.)
So next morning the reporter telephoned 
the man who had called
him and told him he was wrong
about the name of the mother and
son. And said the story was just
as phoney as it had seemed in
the first place. This time the man
agreed it probably was. But where
had he heard the report naming
the mother and son? He explained
he'd heard it from a Mr. -----.
So the reporter called Mr. -----
and Mr. ----- said yes, he'd
heard the story from a young lady,
one of the young ladies in his office,
but he couldn't be sure which one.
And she'd heard it from someone
else, who in turn -- so on, ad infinitum.

Heard In Washington, Too
But before we end this part of
the story, we must tell you that this
man who had called the reporter
went on to explain why now he was
convinced the story was phoney. It
seemed that on the day he first
heard the story, he happened to be
writing a friend in Washington.
So he told him the story. And just
that day he had received a reply
from his friend. His friend wrote
that the story was very interesting 
but he didn't much think it was
true since he had just heard it told
as having happened to a Washington
boy.
That was why we said in the
