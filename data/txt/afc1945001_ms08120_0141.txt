Rumors
A Rumor is something Mrs. 
Loudmouth heard, about the 
ration of can goods, or shoes, 
or when a ship was sailing, 
who in turn it to Mrs. Rattle-
trap, who in turn told it to 
some one else etc.

When we go back to Mrs. Rattletrap we find out that her son was a sailor.  Not wanting his mother to worry about him he gave hints about when his ship might sail.  Mrs. Rattletrap drew her own conclusion from what he had said, his ship was to sail in two weeks for Africa.

Having finish her house work the next thing to do was the marketing.  While marketing she past that new fortune telling place she still had a little time so she went to see what it was like.  She did not know this was a spy headquarters
