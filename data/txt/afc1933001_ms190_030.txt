EXCERPTS - Letter of February 8, 1943 - A. Lomax to W. C. Haygood, Rosenwald.

     Woodrow Wilson Guthrie is, so far as I know, a
unique figure in American literature. First of all, he is a 
genuine folk poet, the kind of person who created our cowboy
and lumberjack ballads. He has written numerous ballads and
songs, so completely true to the idiom of the South and Southwest,
that they at once become a part of the general tradition 
of folk literature. About two and a half years ago I encouraged
him to write a book about his life. This book has developed
into an extremely serious full-length novel, or fictionized
autobiography, which is to be published by Dutton's this month.
It has the quality of real greatness about it, both in the broad
sweep of its ideas, in the accuracy and incisiveness of its
regional detail, and in its truly remarkable rhythmic prose.
Mr. Guthrie wants to travel around the South and write a book
about what is happening to the migrants in wartime. He has the
equipment, I believe, of a major American Writer. So far as I
am concerned, he could serve as an invaluable informant on folk
opinion and wartime folklore among the poor whites of the area.
He is a voluminous correspondent, a guitar player who can
attract other singers as an equal, and his comments on the war,
whether in terms of documentation, ballads, or stories, will be
a real contribution to American culture.

     I strongly suggest that you get in touch with him at
once and look at some of this songs and at least a portion of
his new novel. He deserves all the encouragement that anyone
can give him. His fellowship might amount to $2,000 which
would provide for travel.
