Hywel Wood  .  (cont).

He is getting very old.  but still makes a wonderful sound track with his clogs --  One of the girls at the farm where he lives . plays the harp for him so .  if one went up there -  one could see .  him do his stuff..

Church Music .

Llandmiam .  Montgomeryshire  .
has . something quite special in the way of small village choir - 

Contact .  Miss Davies Gregynog.  Llandmiam
or. of course . the Rector  - Died this morning!

The Chapel I mentioned is Rhos Llanerch crugog near lorex house.

But .  Gwyn Williams would be the best advise on this .

Suggest that Corwen would be an excellent centre - 
there is . also a fiddling miller 
near here . ar Belius Gwerbyl Goch - (noted 
in the past for pilgrims - ballgames in the 
church yard etc)  He is very good .  
but extremely shy - but something might be done - They dance there_  behind locked doors!
