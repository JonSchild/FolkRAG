GARY DAVIS:
Thats where its at if you don't get it, you been
there you understand, if you didn't stay there long. You
know what I'm talking about. You know the people who work
in these banks sometimes these banks cry bankruptcy, you understand.
Somebody knows something about it and whoochie koochie got a 
whole lot of bales of money you understand, who stole its the
bank himself, you understand. You done lost your money
everybody else lost their money. (laughter) Declare bankruptcy.
Sometimes the mail truck so full, money fall off the truck.
Just fell off cause somebody pushed it off. 
LARRY:
That's right.
GARY: 
 Somebody got to know something about it. Well you get it,
you found it laying down there, then you go ahead, you don't
find no name no identification you understand, you go get it up, 
or you ain't never going to have nothing you don't do it.
LARRY:
Tell us about the guy in California who found this money
that fell off the bank truck. He went and turned it in. What they 
did, they took the money back, give him a life time job,
sweeping the floor in the back. They switch managers and the next manager didn't like him and fired him. On top of that his son stopped speaking to him because he turned the money in.
