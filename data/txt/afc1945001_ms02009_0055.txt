are obviously those which allege unverified facts about local groups,
institutions, or problems. The classification of local rumors will 
depend on the rumors which circulate in your community.

The analysis of rumors can best be done by persons trained
in the social sciences. Local universities will generally have experts 
on their staffs who can be asked to serve on the project and
supervise the analysis.

Rumor analysis should indicate what rumors are being spread,
how widely, and in what circles. Such analyses reveal what the rumor
problems are, how serious they are, and toward whom information which blankets rumor must
be directed.

Control Programs--Information

Once it has been decided to blanket a given field of rumors

pamphlets, school projects, library displays, discussion group materials,

Newspapers can offer invaluable aid by contributing columns called "Did you Know That?" or "Things
You Ought to Know," [the project] providing colorful and dramatic information 
designed to fight rumors without specifically mentioning them.

The Continuing Program

In addition to the special educational campaigns worked out
on the basis of information gaps, the continuing purpose of a rumor-
control project may well be to toughen people's minds against rumors and the
repetition of rumors.
