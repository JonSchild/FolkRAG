Dear Miss Meyer:
We have just heard from the State 
Department that Mr. Lange does not have
any phonograph recordings of folk songs.
He reports, however, that there are some
in Brazil and I shall make every effort 
to get these
I hope things are gong well and 
that you will let me hear from you on
your next trip[ to Washington. 
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
