(Davenport)  C.C. Davenport, Piano & s.
I'm Tired/ y-these Jim Crow. B.T. Wingfield, cornet
Goin' leave this " " town,
Dogone my black soul,
I'm sweet Chicago bound
Yes, I'm leave here
From this old
--
I'm going / up north
Where they thinks / money grows on trees
I don't give a dogone
If my black soul is free
I'm going where/
I won't need no B.V.D.'s
__
I got a hat / got a overcoat
Don't need nothin but shoes
Thse Old
Goin give                 the blues

I'm going / up north
Baby, I can't, can't have you
Ain't nothing in this cold country
A      girl can do
I'm going get me northern girl
Baby I am through with you.
