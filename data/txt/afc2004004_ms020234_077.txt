what -- You got many things to lead; you got hundreds of things.
As I say, you got many things, more than a man want.  Sometimes he
say, "Why didn' you tell me?"  See?  "I didn't know so-and-so; why didn'

an' everything, an' the schools is goin' good, you can keep it
good by watchin' an' seein'.  You. . .
