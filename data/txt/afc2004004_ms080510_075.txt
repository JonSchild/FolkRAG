which was all choral[?], which was all syncopated, which was all rhythmically rather than melodically oriented. And they were the first ah English speaking people to make a marriage between these two, and gradually ah their dance tradition was affected by um, by the blacks, and the blacks by theirs. Their fiddle tune tradition was picked up by the blacks, and, and altered and then, ah, then farther - those ah new tunes were further altered by, by  black - by white tra - ah, musicians in the mountains.

And so over this period of history in the southern mountains and the southern backwoods, there was a gradual mingling of north west Europe with its somewhat stark and, and ah sinuous kinds of ah music making, with the thick, sophisticated - with, with the thi - syncopated ah choral [?] styles of the, of black art.
