Dear Harold:
   I'm writing you to make a friendly protest about the new policy
of the recording section in adding a $150 sur-charge to copying projects
which would be published by commercial companies.
  One, it seems to me the fee is too high.  It represents half of the
total advance paid by most companies to cover both editorial and singer
fees.  These advances have never to my knowledge been paid out by royalties.
   If the sur-charge is put on top of the advance the possibility of
royalties being paid on records becomes remote indeed.
   The effect, therefore, is that the Library of Congress receives a
larger fee from a given recording project than anyone else involved it it.
   Another effect is to further reduce the already small fees payable to
both singers and collectors.
   An additional effect is to reduce the possibility of such projects
being contemplated by those small companies interested in them at the
present writing.
   It also seems to me unfair that such a rule should be retroactive. None
of us could foresee the present situation. However, I assume that you are
explaining your new rule to those collectors and singers that are making deposits
with you at this time. No such stipulations however, were known about
prior to this year and they definitely affect the publishing potential for
the material you already have in the foreseeable future. Thus the Library of
Congress recording project is penalizing its old contributors. 
   I realize that the recording laboratory has an income problem but its
surcharge fee is so large in proportion to the economy of ethnic record
publications at the moment that it makes these releases difficult of realization.
   Perhaps, however, we should confine the discussion to the present case.
This year both Texas Gladden and Hobart Smith, both of whom havemade substantial
contributions to the Library of Congress publishing program, have grown quite
ill - heart trouble with strokes threatening them both. I decided to bestir
myself in their behalf and try to get out a record of their best performances
so that they could enjoy having it around for whatever time they have left to
live. Their early Library of Congress recordings are better than can be obtained
from them now as they are both older and have been sick a great deal.  I made
this project number one in a series of things for Kenny Goldstein's Prestige
