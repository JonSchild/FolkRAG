WORK SONG FRAGMENTS

When you hear my hammer ringin',
Steel's meltin' like lead.

If hoppergrasses was hosses I'd have one to ride,
If biscuits was watches I'd have one by my side.

Yonder come a wagon, coming from Liverpool, England,
It's loaded down.
It's loaded with nothin' but those fine-mouth women,
Ain't nary one mie. 

Every mail day I git a letter,
"Son, come home."
I had no ready made money,
Couldn't go home.
I could not read that letter for cryin',
It hurt me so.
What do you regin that first line told me?
De baby dead.
