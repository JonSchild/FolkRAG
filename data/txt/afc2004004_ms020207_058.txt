[*Roe is poisoned*]
[mean to] give me the stuff. And that evening it was about [dirt] dusk -- you
know, we used to work all day until about sun-down - why, she called me
for dinner and [to] we eat. We [finished] eat our supper, and she told me, "You
got to go home; you been working [too] so hard." She say, "You [got to] better
drink this cup of coffee." And, of course, we always minded the older
folks and I drank it. And it began cramping me soon after I left. And
along the side of the road there was an old weed, you know, that
growed, and we used to chew it, you know, for cramps in your stomach,
