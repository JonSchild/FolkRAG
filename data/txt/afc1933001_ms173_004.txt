Dear Mr. Lomax:

 Mrs. Campbell has asked that I write you a note about
your trip the other night.  She isn't sure just what you found,
and whether you wish to go back, but she wanted you to know that
you did not see (or hear) the one who is considered the best
singer in that section.  The singer Mrs. Campbell has found most
sure, so far, is Lish Hall, who lives in an entirely different
direction.  If you are interested to go see him, she would be
glad to up to see him with you on Thursday, or if you wish to
come here Saturday morning - rather early - Lish Hall will be
in with a group of carvers.  Mrs. Campbell is anxious to help
you in any way she can.

Sincerely yours,
(Mrs.) Harriet Cornwell
