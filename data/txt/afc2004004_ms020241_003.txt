[*GOOD STORY:  WOMAN FINES TREASURE IN HAUNTED HOUSE 
AFTER 3 MEN ARE SCARED AWAY*]

BJ:    I heard of a man once, said he was travelin'. . .It's a, it's a
preacher. . .He was travelin', an' ah, he, work was hard to find,
an' he was huntin' work to do in a church, too, ya know?  Ta,
peoples had promised him he could preach at.  An' so he ah, was
goin' along this road an' he seed some white people standin' out
by the lot, on the road.  He asked 'em about a place to stay
that night 'cause it's gittin' dark?  An' gittin' night, however.
An' ah, he knowed that he traveled on, he might come in the
woods an' swamps an' things, you know, saw the dangers, had so
far to go.  An' so, he said. . .
       He went on to them people an' asked 'em about a place to
stay that night, asked 'em could they let 'im stay anywhere, you
know, barn, anywhere, until day, 'cause, 'cause he didn' wanna,
you know, go on the road.
       The man tol' 'im, said, "Yeah," he says, ah, he says, "I
has a house down here," say, "But I cain't git nobody to stay
in it," said, "Cause it's, they say it's haunted."   [An']  Say, "All the
colored peoples I git down there to stay, they moves out."   Said,
"They won't stay there."   An' so, "That's the on'y thing I have
now."  Said, "If ya would stay up here in the barn, but, but you
stay in there," said, "I let you stay there an' then you can work,
too, an' then I'll fix a way for ya to git to your churches."
An' he said, "But, I is willin' for ya to stay."
       So that was good.  'Cause he's huntin' work and goin' to
this church.  An' so, he tol' 'im, "Yeah," said he'd try it.  An'
so, he said, "'Cause I'll jes' try."  Said, "I. . ."
