     I'm goin tell you the only thing that will help it: All nations, all
colors, has got to git together and pray.
     Preacher has got to hold the gun. Thass what makes my lot so hard.
I know what to say an yit it's death to say it. I'm leadin the people an
I know what to tell em, yet I know it's death to tell em.
     The prophets that preached back in ancient times, the old Roman
soldiers burnt em. You could smell the burnin flesh for miles. They burnt
em for standin on the block of truth.
     Let not your good be evil spoken of. Sometimes we try to help
an ouwah own peoples is the instrument of our dyin.
     I could say these things to my congregation, but how long would I
live?
     Although we promise to die with the truth, we sometimes die without
ever tellin it.

WORK

     I sing Christian songs, try to bring some brightness to the minds
of the people bout how we should do, how we should live.
     Fust one song, then another. Sometimes, "Precious Lord, take my
hand, lead me on." Jes depends on what the spirit would give me to sing.
If the spirit give me a fast jubilee song, "Git Right Church An Less Go
Home," or "When God Gits Ready You Got To Move." I stand a few minutes
and play those songs. People be standin listenin sometimes. Sometimes they
call me to stop and play. "Would you mind playin?" I tell em, "Thass the
way I gets my lil change." Don't have no special mount. Anything they
wants to give me fur a selection.
     When people come to me fur what they want, I teach em (sinful songs)
though that has gone out of my life. But publically, I play Christian
