     Anti-British rumors constitute one of the largest
categories covered in this report. New England and the Atlantic
Seaboard seem particularly fertile breeding grounds for
this type.

Anti-Administration -- Roosevelts

New York -- President Roosevelt brought about the war for
personal gains.

Illinois -- President Roosevelt brought on the war because he
wanted to go down in history.

Virginia -- Mrs. Roosevelt favors Negroes over whites.

Anti-Roosevelt stories are not very frequent and occur almost
equally in the South and Middle West. There are also a few
stories which charge that favoritism in shown the Roosevelt
sons.

Anti-Administration -- salvage and rationing

Illinois -- The pipe-line authorities are dumping gas into
creeks and then setting fire to it so that farmers will not
be able to skim it off.

Texas -- Salvaged tin cans are being turned over to beer
manifacturers instead of to the government.

Washington -- There is so much extra sugar that it is fermenting
in the warehouses.

     Of these three, the one concerning sugar is encountered
most frequently. Rumors of this type are found all over the
country although the South and Middle West are high while
New England and the Atlantic Seaboard reveal conspicuously
few.

Anti-Administration -- War Bonds and Savings Accounts

New York -- People are going to have to turn over their
savings to the government or else spend them on War Bonds.

Illinois -- Postal office workers are kept busy overtime
because so many people are cashing in their War bonds as
fast as they can.

Idaho -- The United States will not be able to pay off the
War Bonds.

     These rumors are strongest in the Middle West and Far
West. The Atlantic Seaboard has its share, but there are
very few either in New England or the South.

Anti-Administration -- Selective Service grievances and abuses

Indiana -- A man here gave his yacht to the Mississippi 
Coast Guard with the provision that his son be made Captain
