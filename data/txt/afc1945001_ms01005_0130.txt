Rumor Report

Attached you will find special Intelligence Report, dated
9/30/42, subject - Rumors.

Perhaps no single subject has engaged the fancy and the
attention of more information men in the government than rumors.
In fact, the study of rumors has itself been the subject of rumors.

This first Bureau of Intelligence canvass of the subject
will, we feel, put an end to a good many half-truths which have been
circulated among us about rumor and, more important, will indicate
certain directions in which positive work can be done to neutralize
rumors.

One additional thing this study makes plain: "Don't talk" 
and "don't rumor" are quite different as informational themes.  Careless 
talking may give valuable information to the enemy.  Careless
rumor mongering, this study shows, isn't calculated so frequently to
give valuable information to the enemy.  Its danger lies in its
harmful effects on Americans themselves.

It seems to us that the nature of rumor as portrayed in
this report may suggest to the Motion Picture Bureau ideas for short
subject movies for wide-spread circulation in American movie theatres.
These films might undertake to dramatize in any one of several real
or fictitious situations the harmful effects which a wave of rumors
or even one particular rumor may have.  It is even possible (at least
for the uninitiated) to visualize a full-length picture in which a
rumor can play a dominant role. 

The Motion Picture Bureau's personnel will, of course, have
much better ideas than these on how the material in this report can
be applied to motion pictures than we can suggest.
