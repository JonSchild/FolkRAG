among them Brown Bowen of the outlaw
& the little blind dead Mexican.
The man Brite is one of the finest
fiddler's I've ever heard.  Knows about
300, plays them moderately & with feeling.
He was named after Alce
France (Alc√©e once), an old settler
& Indian fighter.  They hung old Alce's
daddy before his eyes [and Alce]
during the Civil War because he was
a Northern sympathizer - old Alce
& his brother eventually killed out
every member of the mob, those that
didn't get away.
       
One of them, an old man, wanted
to come home to die & his children
came to old Alce - "Daddy is old,
he's gonna die right away anyhow."
Old Alce grunted - if he comes on this
side of the river he's gonna die
mighty sudden."
       
These with other stories lank & hardbitten
R.R. Smith told me.  About Tilden where
everybody is related to everybody else,
where a ham sandwich costs 40
cents, so far behind the times
