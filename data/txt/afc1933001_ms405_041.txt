THE RICH OLD LADY 

A few variants and fragments of British ballads, such as this 
one, have been found among Southern Negroes. On the whole, however,
this tradition was absorbed and creatively used by the Negro
people rather than perpetuated in terms of specific songs. The
incisive and clean-cut story-telling technique, the use of incremental
repetition, the handling of dramatic dialogue, the stanza
form to be found in "John Henry," "Po' Laz'us," "Frankie," and
others, were, in all likelihood, indirectly derived from the classical
English and Scottish traditions; but to this already rich technique,
the Negro brought his genius fro direct, introspective penetration
into the emotions of his characters, and a wealth of melocdic
and thematic ideas of his own. 

James Baker, whose prison nickname is Iron Head, knew four or
five songs and ballads of British derivation. As he sang, he closed
his eyes and sat stiff and straight in his chair in the posture of
the traditional British ballad singer the world over; but his melodies,
though basically British, had been decorated in a fashion that
made them not only a very individual, but a most exquisite British
song set.
