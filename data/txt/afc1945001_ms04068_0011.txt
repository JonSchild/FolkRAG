Rumors relative to Spanish-Americans being barred from
trades and factories have been rampant in this area for some time
and are again raising a menacing head.  The Spanish-Americans,
according to the rumors, are encountering great difficulties in
acquiring skilled jobs for which they are especially trained and,
even though many have found employment, only a small proportion
have been placed in work adapted to their skills.  The rumors say
that even Europeans are given jobs in trades and factories which
are denied Americans of Spanish extraction and the Spanish-Americans
feel that it is a racial prejudice rather than lack of efficiency
as workers.  A remark frequently heard is, "They are good enough to
be drafted into the army but not good enough to get defense jobs."
