D. M. 4
D   Pass hurriedly over the Minstral Song with a
few remarks
a) It proves that the whites are more
initative than the blacks -- when there's money
in it. Origin [??] symbolic. Seriously the result of culture swapping again.
b) Daddy Ric[?] takes cloths off the backs of a poor
Negro tramp in back of the theatre & leaves him
shivering in the alley while he scores triumph.
c) Thirty years later the minstral show was
standard, living off of rather vicious satire on
Negroes, paternal sentimental attitude toward
Negroes, Negro banjo & dance steps.
d) However, as Handy or Rosamund Johnson can
testify, this gave Negroes their first beak
in the entertainment world & [laid the] by
giving their instruments a chance to develop
instrumental techniques at the basis of 
ragtime & jazz, Look into the minstral
tradition in the community.s
