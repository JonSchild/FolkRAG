1. There was a batallion of soldiers with a negro
 C.O. These soldiers were trained perfectly.
 They did fine in day time activities but
 in attempted nite manuvers the men balked. 
When one of them were asked why he 
quickly retorted. "Too much Blackground."

2. A colored and a white man were standing 
in front [of] a poster reading "We'll win
this war 'cause we are on Gods side The
White man shook his head and replied,
"Isn't it the truth." The colored man
turned and looked at him. "Listen," he
said, "a colored man said that, didn't
he?" The white man nodded yes. Then
said the colored man that means
that us Negroes are going to win this war.
Then we are going to see about you
white folks.
