work among these field hands
of lower South Carolina.
We are writing to go to the 
Worlds Fair in 1939 in N.Y.
If there is any wy you can 
help I will greatly appreciate.
Hope you will enjoy the records
and the pictures ard there 
is ever so much more material 
if you ever want Mr. Lomax
to record it.
Sincere thanks
