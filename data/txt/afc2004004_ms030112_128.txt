MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, I'm glad.
LIONEL:
Larry, did he teach himself all those cords, or most of them.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes.
LARRY:
I would say he did.
LIONEL:
He made them up himself by practicing.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, like I said before he'd get a number he'd go over it, and he'd just keep playing it till he would get it just like he wanted it.
LARRY:
He told you that. Speaking of his cords and all that did he play how well you know the key board. Rev. Davis, like Mrs. Davis say, a lot of it come from him, he carried a lot of it in his head and by him moving around that type thing is possible. I mean every house with a guitar in it three people in a house playing guitar, I imagine at that time, so it was easy for Rev. Davis in a way. Now it depends on the player whether he works it out just like you say. You know you see anybody good like Rev. Davis say, you hear a good thing you get out of it what you put into it.
