Dear Alan:
As you will see from
Mrs. Witt's letter you own a
Lead Belly book.  Send me $3 and I'll 
get it delivered.  If you don't 
do this it will be up to "poor old 
dad," and he's down to the bottom
of his barral.
You must take time to 
write and thank Mrs. [Smith] Witt
and Miss McCluskey.
Shirley and the children 
are here. How was Bess
looking?  Lovingly,
Father
