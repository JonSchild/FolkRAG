Dear Ed:
Thank you for your note about the Dillards, whom I'll
catch.
On thinking the matter over, it seems to me that there's 
no great advantage in the Sea Island group making the
Detroit date.  The money is not good, but besides that,
it means exposure for them to the nightclub situation,
and I'd rather they stayed out of that for as long as pos-
sible.  I am going to so advise them.
What can you tell me about plans for filming the group
at Fort Valley College?
All the best,
Alan Lomax
