Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt
Livingston, Alabama

Dear Mrs. Tartt

Naturally I regret very much that it will be impossible 
for you to do your recording this fall.  I look forward, however
to our spending the machine down in the spring, when 
weather and all conditions will be better for work.  It may 
be at that time, however, that the trip will have to be 
somewhat shorter than before planned.  We can discuss that later. 

Your letters are always a delight, and I wish I had the 
energy and inspiration to adequately answer them.  Allow me to say, 
however, that the Library of Congress and the Archive of folk
song, and myself especially, do appreciate and hold in true value
the fine contribution you have already made to the field of the 
American humanities.

Much love from Elizabeth and myself, 
Alan Limax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-song
