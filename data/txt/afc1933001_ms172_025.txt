Dear Alan:

After an apparently exhaustive study on 
the part of the Accounting Department, I finally 
received the enclosed memo this morning. It means 
that according to our records not only were all the 
checks due you issued, but have been cashed by you 
and the cancelled checks returned to CBS.

As for the telephone bill, I sent it 
immediately to Leon Levine who quickly returned it 
with the notation that we could not send a check to 
the Chesapeake Telephone Company that was submitted 
to the Library of Congress. He says that the only 
way the School of the Air can okey it is if you pay 
it and send the receipted bill to him with a notation 
that the call was definitely on School of the Air 
business.

Sterling Fisher tells me that things seem 
to be all set for the trip to Mexico City. I understand 
that Leadbelly is still in the hospital and we 
can't be sure whether he will be well enough to go or 
not. I share your hope that he will.

How are your own plans coming for a sojourn 
in Mexico and points South? The last time I saw 
Harold he told me that things seem to be shaping up 
very nicely. Our activities here are hectic as usual 
and despite the usual budgetary difficulties we do 
have a few good shows on the air.

My regards to you and Elizabeth.

Sincerely,

Bill
