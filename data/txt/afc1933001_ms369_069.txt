That evening Bouki (??) Mister Lion
on top of his head and went staggering
away. Half way home Mister Lion
began to bite and scratch. He tore Bouki
all to pieces, but Bouki wouldn't relinquish his
supposed sheep. Instead he said to Ti Malice
whom he had just encountered, "Oh Ti Malice,
I'm so glad I met you. I've been meaning
to come around (??) and get you to help me
steal the finest bunch of sheep you ever
saw. Somehow I just now got around to
it. Now if you'll just hold this one
while I excuse myself a moment, I'll 
give you half of him when we get home."
Malice (??) Mister Lion on his head.
Mister Lion had meantime given him the 
high-sign. Bouki slipped away into
the bush. When he was a hundred yards
(away) from the path, he called,
"Malice - o - Malice - o, can you see
me?"
Malice answered "yes, I can see you."
Bouki went a quarter of a mile and shouted
"Malice - o, Malice - o, can you see
me now?"
