to put with my schedule (already
filed with Spivacke) and I'll in
turn submit a route to you
for final approval. Uncle Allie
finally made some connections
with railway workers, levee groups
on the Mississippi, etc. that looked
interesting. Also a friend wants
me to come to his plantation in Northeast Mississippi
(where we have never been). Mrs.
Tavetts in Livingston, Ala. has uncovered
a mine of new stuff, etc. I'm
quite willing to change all
my plans now to just what
you and Spivacke direct. I'm
glad to be relieved of responsibility.

I figure that September
will be as early as we can
get all details smoothed out. If
you can get a machine to me
earlier, I can do some recording
