Fisk, 18.  2.

Fair, fair.
You ain't fadin'.
Well, like me.
Comb your hair.
You ain't combin'.
[Comb like me,]
Fair, fair.

[No on]
No one's at the door, p[p]ealse.
Where the boat, where the boat?
You get out, please.

Come on, Terry,
Three fourteen.
Match boat, match boat.
Row that boat in.
Row the boat, play team,
All together, let us in.

Little Sally Water.

Miss Sally Walker
Sitting in the saucer,
Crying in the frying pan,
Who drink the water?

Ride, Sally, ride.
Wipe your weeping eyes.
It ain't no yip, 
That your backbone slip.

Shake it to the east,
Shake it to the west,
Shake it to the 
Very one you love the best.

Momma said so,
Poppa said so --
That's the way to shake
When you want to catch a beau.

My name is Queen Esther.  I live on Mr. Baldwin's place, near Clarksdale.  
I am 13 years old.  The game is played by a circle that one get 
in the ring and stoop down and the kids, they is crying for a cool 
drink of water.  Then you sing:

Little Sally Walker
Sitting in a saucer.
We're crying for a 
Cool drink of water.

Rise, little Sally, rise.
Wipe your weeping eyes.
Put your hand on your hip.
Let your backbone slip.
