Memorandum.   November 15, 1940

Dr. Mitchell of New York University has expressed his desire to
begin recording in New York City and I recommend that a portable
Presto machine be forwarded to him along 50 acetate records
and four saphire cutting needles, as soon as possible.

The duplicate which he requested some time ago has now been made
for him and is ready to be shipped  to him immediately.

Thank you,
Alan Lomax
