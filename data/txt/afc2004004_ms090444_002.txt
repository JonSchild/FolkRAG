INTERVIEW WITH S. L. MANGHAM
[*named “Stack” Mangham. [He told]
Stack told us...*]

Music has always been my hobby.  When Handy was here I'd go out and
play, make four or five dollars.  I'd always give it to him.  I had a good
job making a living.  I'd give it to him to help him stay here.
I worked in the Planters Bank as a clerk for thirty-two years.  There
was a man here named Sam Hurst, a wealthy man and a big politician and one of
the stockholders in the bank.  They wanted a porter at the bank and the cashier 
asked him to find one that would be reliable.  He proposed me.  The first day 
I was there one of the bookkeepers was sick and the cashier asked me to do a 
little writing.  After he found out I could do it, in six months I was promoted
to a clerkship.  I made what was a big salary here -- $1500.00 a year, and a 
bonus for 32 years.
I was born and raised right here, had a good reputation and the white 
people never said anything about me working in the bank.  New people coming in
town would remark about it, but those who lived here were accustomed to seeing
me there.  One new fellow came in town and he made a remark to a man who lived
here, "I thought Holland was a Democrat but he's got that nigger working in
the bank."  The man he was talking to said, "You'll have to talk to Holland 
about that."  I alwaysgot on fine with the fellows in the bank.  I can go 
there now and get any recommendation from them.  One of the finest compliments
ever paid me was when we would get out of balance in the afternoon.  My work 
was always the last to be checked.  A new feller came there to work once and
because I was colored he decided to check mine first.  The man saw him and 
asked him what he was doing.  He told him and the Cashier said, "Oh, hell, his
is all right; you go check your own."  Something happened once, I never knew
