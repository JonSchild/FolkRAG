Chorus:
There was howling in the kitchen like a caravan of tinkies,
Some was playing ping-pong and tiddly-widdly-winkies.
It's up the howe and down the howe, ye never saw sae genties,
At McGinty's meal andale where the pig gaed on a spree.
2) Mrs McGinty's pig had broken loose and wandered ben the lobby,
Open shoved the pantry door and come among the toddy.
And he took kindly to the stuff like ony human body,
McGinty's meal and ale where the pig went on a spree.
3) Mrs McGinty, she run, but the hoose, the way was dark & crooked,
Far she fell hilter gowdie o'er the pig whaur had she never lookit,
She let out a skirl that would-a paralyzed a chookit (a lap-wing.)
At McGinty's meal and ale whaur the pig went on a spree.
4) Johnny Murphy he run after her and o'er the pig was leaping,
Till he trampled on an asset, it was settin' fu' o' dripping, (beef pan)
Till he fell doon and peelt his croon an' he couldna hod for greeting,
At McGinty's meal and ale where the pig went on the spree.
5) Mrs McGinty took the thing in hairt an' she hiddit in a closet,
And they rubbed Johnny Murphy's heid wi' turpentine and roses,
And they handled him with meal and ale, you really would suppose it,
That he'd sleept in a mason's trough an' risen frae a spree.
It's weary on the barley bree an' weary on the weather-laddie,
Drabs of eat and drink they gang nae weel together.
By this time the pig was fu' an' wishing for anither,
At McGinty's meal and ale where a pig went on a spree.
Chorus:
They'd eely pigs and geely pigs and pigs for hoddin butter,
But this pig was roaring fu' and fallin' among the gutter.
Till McGinty with his foreman carried him oot upon a shutter,
At McGinty's meal and ale where the pig went on a spree.
Shadow Soup- A pan of boiling water, with the shadow of a piece of beef.
Beef Brose: Oatmeal with boiling broth, a pinch of salt, butter.
Sowans: Dust off the oatmeal boiled up with sugar and cream over it 
Bannoks: Yoke of an egg, salt, oatmeal cake about 6 inches wide.
6) Some gaed east and some gaed west until the door was yarked (broken)
And it mind ye on the middle of one Akie Fair market.
Till I fell doon an open drain an' baith my shins got barkit,
At McGinty's, etc..
