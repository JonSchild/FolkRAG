Dear Dr. Spivacke:
I returned from my visit to Washington to enter upon a new
undertaking with the National Youth Administration. The
NYA officials here had decided to organize a youth orchestra
in Dallas, and I was invited to assist in getting it underway
During the investigation of our own NYA rolls I found many
guitar players, and I believe we have some fiddle players as
well. In the Southwest there is more opportunity for Hillbilly
players to secure employment on the radio programs than for
any other type of musician. It has occurred to me that we
may be able to do something in the direction of preparing
young people for such employment. We shall try to set high
standards for our music project, and we would want our Hillbilly
units to use only authentic folk material.
We would greatly appreciate the assistance of your division
in this undertaking, and would it be possible to furnish us 
with a list of music and possible sources of securing such
music? Would any of the music in your library be available to 
us and could we secure permission to copy some of it?
We shall be grateful for any suggestions or assistance you may
give us.
Very truly yours,
Ivalee Hobden
