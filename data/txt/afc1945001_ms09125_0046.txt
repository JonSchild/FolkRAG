Home For His Birthday
It is just two days before my birthday, and I wish to get a furlough. A letter arrives from his sister telling him that if he could get permission that he could come home for his birthday.  He goes to his commanding officer's office and tells him some story about his mother being sick. Well he get his furlough and arrives home in time for his birthday. He was given five days furlough and did he use them. His mother was no more sick than I was when I heard he was coming home and was I glad.
