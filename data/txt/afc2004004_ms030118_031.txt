     This git-tar don't sound like a guitar.  Sound mo like
a drum, don't it?  (He plays opening of "Cocaine".)  Take a guitar
to call my women out the bottom.
     (Bernie:  That's the best sounding guitar I ever heard.)
     It don't sound like a gi t-tar.
     (Bernie:  It's got a wonderful, deep sound to it.)
     (Me:  What does it sound like, Rev. Davis?)
     It sounds like a jug.  Uh -huh.
     (Me: Like what?)
     (Bernie:  Yeah.  When you hit those low notes it 
sounds like a jug.  Or like a Jew's harp.)
     (He plays a little more)  See?  It's like no git-tar.
I don't need no lectric wid dis git-tar.  (And he doesn't H e plays
a dreadful sentimental popular tune, "Tessie, With the
Sparklin' Eye."  This is the most awful piece of music I've heard him
play, and he tries to sing the syrupy lyrics in his croaking,
harsh voice of Lennox and 135th Streets.)
     (Me:  Where would you sing that song, Rev. Davis?)
     I sing it to a gal, when I was courtin er.  (he begins
to sing another verse, sniffing and sobbing and putting on a great
oafish show of whining grief) Oh-oh-oh-oh!  (This makes his voice
more tuneless and squeezed up than ever.  "Tessie, you
know I love you, Madame, you makemy heart weight about a pound.  
Tessie, you know I couldn't live without you, Tessis, oh-oh-oh-oh."
She bout broken his heart, you see.  H e beggin huh not to quit him.
(He now plays "Cocaine Done Killed My Baby", which ought to bring him
in a million years.  The chords beat upon every part of you heart,
tender, moaning, caressing.)  Thass one of them old time pieces.
(He mutters the words very low and undistinguishable.  But it's
quite a daring step, for he swore he would never give them to me.)
