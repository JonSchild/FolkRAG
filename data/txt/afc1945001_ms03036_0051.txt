Gentlemen: Re: Cooperation with Office of War Information

At the request of Mr. Fred M. Wilcox, Regional Director, Social
Security Board, Region VIII, Minneapolis, I wish to report regarding
War Rumors for the period August 3 through August 15, 1942.

During the above-mentioned period, I visited the following
communities:

August 3 - 4 - 5 Minneapolis, Minnesota
August 6 Bismark, North Dakota
Jamestown, North Dakota
August 7 Valley City, North Dakota
August 8 Fargo, North Dakota
August 9 Perham, Minnesota
August 10 - 15 Minneapolis, Minnesota

No war rumors were heard during this period in any of the places
visited. Conversations heard consisted of direct statements, with crop
and harvest information being mentioned as often as war. In North Dakota
at least six persons I talked with expressed the hope that prime war
contracts would be awarded in that State.

Yours very truly,
Ned McDonald E.H.
