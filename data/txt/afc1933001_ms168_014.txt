Dear Mr. Lomax:

I don't quite understand the point of your letter in respect to my request that you forward payment in the sum of $96.17 covering money advanced by Columbia Broadcasting System on your behalf.

The recriminations against Miss Scott in which you indulge have no connection with this matter whatever so far as I can see. Perhaps you were opposed to being managed by the Columbia Lecture Bureau but the fact remains that you finally used your own judgment and did sign a contract. The fact also remains that whether or not you had any misgivings you authorized the expenditure of this money for you and it only seems proper that you should reimburse us.

I don't know the status of your management contract at the moment so I am sorry I cannot advise you. As I understand the situation Management Corporation of America which ran the Columbia Lecture Bureau made some kind of deal with another Lecture Bureau. How this affects you you will have to discuss with the people with whom you have your contract, namely Management Corporation of America. 

I am sure that even though you may not be able to pay us the full sum now that you at least can start making payments on account and I would appreciate your doing so at once.

                                   Very truly yours,
                                      [*IS Becker*]
