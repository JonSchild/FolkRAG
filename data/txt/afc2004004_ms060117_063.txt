Dear Alan:

Thanks very much for your letter. Warren will be
back next week. I'll relay your message to him
so that he can call Rosen and get things started
before you return in August.

I don't see any reason why all the things you 
mention can't be worked out satisfactorily for all
concerned. Warren Ling is the expert in spelling
out these matters, however, so I will keep in close
touch with him and your agent, in the hope that we
can get publication arrangements moving by the time
you return.

Best wishes for a fine stay on that wonderful Island.

Sincerely yours,
Bob
BOB BOLLARD
