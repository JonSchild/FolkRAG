Fat Emma is his darling wife
She is the joy and pride of his life
But now he is gone and left her
to mourn
And there is no one at home
to brew the corn
     ====
Fat Emma a cannot sleep, a wink
all night
All she does is lay & think
of Al her bootleg king
                  ==
When Al returns this fall
There will be no gasoline for him
