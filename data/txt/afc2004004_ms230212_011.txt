Item # 3 [Translation]  Vensa Sinavé

[Note:  Once more a [the] term -- as heard on the tape -- is unfamiliar.
"Vennsa Sinavé" is here interpreted as is; but this term
is the most frequent in a song which in itself is rather
repetitive.  Note that the word "venn" by itself means
"vein" [whi] [through which blood is transmitted in the
body].  Since reference is made in the song to one
person being hospitalized, it is very probable that
the recurrent term "Vennsa Sinavé" refers to a
damaged or injured vein suffered by the person [Alan].
