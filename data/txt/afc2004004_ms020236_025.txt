Dawson, I went there to see Sister.  So then I could sit around 
at the fire, feet in the fire [an'] with all of [that] them.  So.  But anyway, 
tha's the on'y time I went there.   An' I was realizin' many 
things.   You know, places where we was sittin' out in the park.
Out there was a beautiful park, in Cuspeth.   We used to sit out
in that park an' eat different things -- Mama'd bring me good candy an' good 
crackers an' cheese an' stuff; we'd sit there and eat until time 
to go catch the train to go back home.  I remember. . .
TL:          That was before [that] though...
BJ:          Yeah, Lawd!  When I was. . .
TL:          You never went back up there?
BJ:          No more; jus' that one time.
TL:          Bessie, how did you get home?   Did Uncle Gene take you 
home?
BJ:          Me and Mama both of us was comin' home the next day.  She was helpin' 
Uncle Gene hoe out some cotton.   An' then, we had been there, ya 
know?   We were there when the thing started.  You see.  But Son 
had come through that day an' he knew they was in behind him.  We
[He] tol' [her] him to go on home, ya see, you know, to try an' make it 
home.    Uncle Gene [wasn't]wouldn't go[in'] nowhere.   Wouldn't be missin'.  
Because they'd know -- they'd look for him to carry 'im off, 
you see.   You know.  An' so, [they] Mama said -- Mama was goin' on home; 
tol' him to come on to Dawson, an' then get him on to Benevista.  Well, 
that's [night -- that] like the day -- he[come] ran out through the yard and picked me 
up; I was just adrawin' dolls.   An' tha's the las' I seen of him.  
An' then me an' Mama lef' the next day, you see.   Well, the next 
week he had made it on down to Dawson.  You know, [he] through hustlin' an' 
hidin' in places.   An' [he went right] on through there an' come that 
close to our house an' didn' know it.  'Cause he didn't know
exactly where Mama stayed.
TL:          Did Uncle Gene go with you the next day or did he stay?
BJ:          No, he stayed and worked, ya see?  But Mama go over to town; 
Uncle Gene's wife, she drove us over to town.
TL:          And who, when did Uncle Gene come to Dawson?
BJ:          Oh he... After his [father] farm was over.  He stayed there 
after [(] his [father).] farm
TL:          They didn't bother him, huh?
