Dear Mr. Strunk:

We have had the recording machine
 gone over carefully by two
experts, and have played it and recorded along side
theirs. To make it equal to the best
we have found, will require $250. Are
you, and Mr. Putnam willing for
an expenditure of that amount from 
the Carnegie grant? The work should
be done at once, so that we may
do some recording on our
way south.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
