A young peg-legged man wished to
volunteer in this war. He went to the draft 
board to take his physical examination. 
The doctor looked at him, shook his
head and said, "Why you have a peg-leg;
you can't fight in this war." 
The young man faced the doctor with
a honest look on his face and said, "I'm
sure there are some peg-legged Japs I can
mow down."
