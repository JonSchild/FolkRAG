TWO

Tonight I'd like to give you in a few moments some of the
root stuff of American folk music - Negro and white - covering
most of the main type.
First, it's Sea Shanties. In the 1830's and 40's, the
American clipper ships were the swiftest and the American Shanty
men were reputed to be the best singers. Now I would like to
introduce to you J. M. Hunt, otherwise known as Sailer Dad, who
sang his Shanty songs in American ships for forty years and then
settled down in the country in Southwest Virginia because he had
fallen in love with the mountain people. His first song is
HAIL AWAY, MY ROSY, and the second, WHEN JONES'S ALE WAS NEW.

Here next is the ballad singer - the tale teller - the man
who remembers the old words and the old tunes and who makes new
ones wherever the men gather. He is quite smiling - maybe Irish.
And he can sing you to sleep or knock you cold with equal grace.
Here's Burl Ives, from Southern Illinois, to sing you the western
ballad I'M RIDIN' OLD PAINT and the soldier ballad THE BOLD SOLDIER.
