hours begin at 8.30 and continue until 11.00 or 12 at night. Some 
of the fellows here, who have been keeping this pace for a
good while are on the verge of some kind of breakdown.
    We found a great many former friends and several
former college profs here. Among the people we have come
across, is a former roommate of Laya's; one of my first
gals now married to the physicist who sat next to me in freshman
German; a couple of college lab partners, and guess what,
Bob Soenkin's uncle, who formerly was a physics prof
at City College, and a girl who was my secretary at
the University.
  I am trying to have the Lab. include me in on one of
the numerous conferences that happen in Washington in order
that I might get back. I miss you and the going very much.
  How are things in the Lab? Do you know what Joe
is doing now? Has he landed something permanent? Also I
am curious to know whether Louis Heitor ever found the microphone.-
Are there many trips planned for this summer, and finally
are you and Elisabeth thinking of comming this way as
we hope you may?  Our regards to Elisabeth
Jerry
