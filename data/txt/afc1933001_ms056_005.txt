print the title of our book incorrectly 
each time it is mentioned
in your Index of Titles.

I wish further to call
your attention to the fact that
our "ballads" are composites (in
most instances) not available in
any other source. With the 
facts before me you have
violated the laws of ordinary
courtesy and, moreover, have
flaunted the copyright statutes.

Yours truly,
John A. Lomax
