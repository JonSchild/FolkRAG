BJ TAPE 7A, p. 104

     An' when you birth a baby, even your toe joint.  Every joint
jus', jus' stands apart.  You don't know it.  Some folks do it
so quick an' they so slip-jointed an' so easy, it looks like they
don't even pay attention, ya see.  An' some is very hard, ya see?
That's the way that is.  So that's why some of 'em have it easier
than the others, ya see.
     But ah, I know I'd rather have one like I had mine than
to have it in another way.  So some like. . .
TL:  How did you have yours?
BJ:  Very hard.
TL:  Oh, really?
BJ:  Yeah, very hard.  Un-hun.  'Cause, ya see, you got to bear
that second pain a death, anyhow.  In this world.  I'd rather
bear it -- If I'm havin' children, I'd rather bear it with the
children.  Than to go to sleep an' don't know nothin'.  I mean --
What I mean ah, un, jus' do sumpin' or other that kill the pain
an' ya don't even feel it?  Jus' bear it.  Ya see?  An' the baby [is] jus'
born.  But Jesus' word never fail.  He say, "You gonna bear the
second pain of death."  Well, that make some of them folks, when
it time to die, they die so hard.  Yet they ain't -- They may be
saved, but you got to bear the second -- You, you got to git that
over with here.  Ya see?  An' so, I believe I'd rather, I'd rather
go on.  You catch most of 'em that has a lot of chirren that way,
[you know,] an' they go on.  When [it] the time [for them] come to die, there's nothin' to do.
Jus' go.  Because you done went through all those things. See?  An'
Jesus say, "you must bear it.  'Cause that, that was the curse
from the Garden of Eden.  So therefore, I['d] rather bear it here
that, if, either, if I'm gonna have chirrun.  If you ain't gonna
have none, why, you got to take what the Lord give ya.  Ya see?
