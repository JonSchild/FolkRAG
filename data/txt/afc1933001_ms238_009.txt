The enclosed copy of one of your
letters to me, which I may use in my book
illustrates what I have told about
your early skill in writing. You
were nineteen at the time you
penned it. If you will recall
the entire scene, I away up in
bleak Dakota, barely able to drag 
about a sorely wounded body,
piping out feebly my puny
twaddle to gawking multitudes,
you in the midst of dire
misfortune striking us on the weakest part
of our line, your letter telling
the news, withholding nothing, in [?]
vivid, crisp, clear-cut sentences,
shining diamonds --- xxxx.
Again I say you [might]
owe it to yourself to so arrange
your life that you will again
have leisure to do you best work --
and write.
Lovingly, 
Father.
