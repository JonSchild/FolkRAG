Fremault, Yvonne 

I heard a report on the radio
that America would be engaged
in another war.  this time with
Russia if aid was not sent to Russia
immediately and rumors of wiping
communism out of Russia immediately 
dispelled.  Russia feels as it seems to me
that we will turn against her after 
the war because of the communism (war) and
that is why Russia feels uneasy. 
I feel that we are giving her a 
dirty deal.  I'm all for help to
Russia now before its too late.  Russia
is a strong enemy.
