This memorandum shall cover the General Recording Objectives of 
the Archive of American Folk Songs for the next few years.

I. To accumulate by [long] loan, [exchange] and rerecording all of the discs and cylinder 
collections now in existence in the United States.

II. To accumulate by gift and purchase all commercial [company] recordings 
of folk songs in this hemisphere.

III. To expand the collection of field records in the Library of 
Congress:

1. By further field expeditions sponsored, supravised,
 and carried out under the direction of the Archive.

2. Work carried out by outside governmental or non-governmental 
institutions, encouraged and aided by the archive.

3. Radio transcription of spot broadcasts and the like.

..................

I. Rerecording.

There are approximately 3695 [disc] recordings [and] 
[cylinder] recording in private hand sand in non-governmental 
institutions in the United States. It is most important that these 
records be brought to the library for duplication within the next 
year or so. This will be the easiest and least expensive way for us 
to add to the scholarly and comprehensive stature of the Archive of 
American Folk Song. [A list of these collections forms the appendix 
A of the memorandum]

[The most positive step in this direction will be the duplication
 of the records in the Archive of American Folk Songs which 
are now available with no restriction for:

A. General public
B. Scholary use

There are:

A 16 titles_______________.

B_____ titles____________.
