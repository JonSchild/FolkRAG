Senatobia, Miss..

Dear Reverend Lee,

     After a lengthy tour through the South I finally returned home and
have arranged for some of the pieces to be [published] put on records.
Probably everything I recorded at your church will eventually be
released. I can now make a donation to the church at the rate of
$10 per song for all those released. And I will also pay the [singers] lead
singers an advance against their of $10. It is only fair that the lead singers
receive whatever royalties come due from the sale of these records.
Among them will be your wife, Mary Lee.
     Enclosed are two contracts covering 1) your permission for me to
put out the records on payment of $10 per song and XXXXX 2) a seperate
contract for your wife.
     When these papers have been signed and XXXX returned to me, I 
will send the fees mentioned as soon as definite choice has been made
of the songs to go into the records. Three songs are almost certain
to be included in the first lps, so that a fee of $30.00 will be payable 
almost immediately.
     Please sign and have your wife sign these letters and return them
to me as soon as possible so that this business can be completed.
                                                                 Yours sincerely

                                                                    Alan Lomax
