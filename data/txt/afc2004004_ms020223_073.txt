BJ:  Yeah -- n-- we didn't have no desks.  We went to school in
the church.  See?  I never sit to a desk in my life!
TL:  Really!
BJ:  No.  Not, not for school, ya know.  Uh-huh.
TL:  What did you do, just sit in the rows?
BJ:  Jus' sit in the ch-- in the, ah, in the seats.  Benches.  We
had long, big, pretty benches.
TL:  What did you do with your books?
BJ:  Well, they, ah, put them on the side a ya.  Or either down
under the next bench.  See?  Like that.  An' ah, 'cause we carried
'em.
TL:  You carried your own books?
BJ:  Um-hum.
TL:  You never left them at school?
BJ:  No.  'Cause, see, they had to buy those books those days.
See?  An' we carried the books with us.  Now, some of those high
grade children would leave their books up [in] around the pulpit,up
there, ya know, 'cause they had so many of 'em.  See?  In that
way, see?  But most of 'em be carryin'.  We had book sacks, ya
know.  Some times they'd make our own book sacks, ya see.  Some chilren.
TL:  What do you make them out of?
BJ:  Out of, out of that stiff (oilinbug ?) stuff what they make
cotton sacks out of, but yet an' still, they were dyed.  An' have
some blue, red, anything that way.  Put a strop on it jus'
like a cotton sack strop.  Then put the books in it.  An' dye
those ol' sacks.  Have 'em pretty, see.  There was plen'y of 'em was
made, plen'y of 'em.  They last years an' years 'cause they's
good.  They better'n these here things ya run an' buy now.
