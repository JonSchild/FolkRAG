Dear Mabel,

Thank you again and again for the Pecans which we are enjoying
immensely. I fear I have been very remiss about looking for
work for you and the group. Ed Pearl has sent out a leaflet
in which he is advertising you and we both feel certain that
you will get some bookings in the West next spring. Meantime,
as soon as I get home from California, I will send out another
circular letter like the one I originally sent out about
Bessie and try to line up some dates for you in this part of
the world.

I will get the clippings you sent copied and sent back to
you for your files, as they belong in the hands of the group.

You all did a great job at John's Island, which is going to
affect life there for a long time to come.

I am running to the plane and will write again as soon as I
get back home on December 5. 

All the best to you and John and everyone from Anne and,

Alan Lomax
