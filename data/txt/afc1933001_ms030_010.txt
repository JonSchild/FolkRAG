[?], Texas,
July 19, 1935

Dear Mr [?]: // I think
 it will be possible for
 Alan or for me to be with 
Mr. Jennings when he visits 
near Meridian, Miss.  That
 section has interesting folk
 song possibilities. I shall
 await his letter before deciding.// 
My wife and I are on our way to Washington,
 doing some investigation as we travel.

Yours sincerely

John A. Lomax
