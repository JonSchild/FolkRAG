Tell my wife when you go to hills
I'm here workin' at the sorghum mill

Shit that turd on my plantation
                etc.

yells that father gives as typical
country boy yells from Basque Co..
The effect of the whole is to double him
up with laughter after each stanza.
The pleasure and wickedness of imitating the
agressor, who is a clumsy and harsh
voiced singer. He has no understanding
