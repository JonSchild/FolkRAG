The Scottish Tradition Music-casette series 
is a companion to the disc series (also 
Scottish Tradition) published from recordings 
in the archives of the School of Scottish 
Studies, University of Edinburgh. It aims to 
cater for a number of rather more specialised 
interests. For example: to present material 
of special interest to an already informed 
audience, hence the cassettes come with a 
minimum of documentation; or to supplement 
where appropriate similar recordings already 
issued in the disc series: or thirdly to partner 
published material in books and periodicals 
etc. devoted to the traditional arts of Scotland's 
musicians, storytellers and poets. 

TGMMC 501 is the first of a number of cassettes 
featuring the pibroch repertory of the Scots highland 
bagpipe, and is intended primarily as a 
service to piper and pipe music enthusiasts. It 
is planned that this and subsequent hundred-minute 
cassettes, each featuring the pibroch repertory and 
style of an individual piper (something no single 
disc could do adequately) will serve as a prelude 
to a more general survey of the tradition on disc. 
When these recordings were made tape-recording 
equipment and techniques were relatively unsophisticated 
compared with those of today; however, 
while these recordings are by no means equal to 
present-day standards, we feel that the historical 
and artistic importance of P.M. MacLean's 
performances outweighs other considerations. 

Proposed future issues will include: Calum Johnston, George Moss, PM R.B. Nicol, PM R. Brown.
