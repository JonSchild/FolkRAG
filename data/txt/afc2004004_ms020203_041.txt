All hid?
Yes...

The children would be hiding about and the one that
is counting. After they say Yeah, they all hid, well I
back way out yonder I'm peepin' tryin to see where they
at and they peepin, they watchin me, and I don't see nobody
on this side thehouse--- I ain't gon git far from this base
cause if I beat 'em back here they ain't got no hundud,
but if they beat me there they got they hundud . They ain't
never told me what the hundud was ,That's just the play.
They can hide out and catch me way from this base and get it
and hold it well they got they hundud and they go out there
somewhere and lay out and cool off, we call it. But I ain
gon git fuhAnd if I hear a noise or anything I break right
back to this base...
