WHITE AND BLACK
(From "U.S. at War", Time Magazine, Vol. XL No. 8, Aug. 24, 1942)

"That afternoon Negroes entertained the President's
wife. She had her picture taken with Negro leaders. She 
reviewed a parade of Negro soldiers from Camp Sutton, N.C.,
led by white officers. In the evening Mrs. Roosevelt gave
the address that the Negroes had been anxious to hear, that
the whites had feared would put kerosene on Salisbury's
coals. Of 2,000 listeners, only 100 were white and many of 
them came from other towns. Said Mrs. Roosevelt:

'We must have patience and we must try with all
our might to bring about recognition of the fact
that man must have equal opportunity to get any job
he is capable of filling. Minority groups in the 
United States have taken work bringing small incomes,
and therefore set the whole economic level very low,
for no other reason but that they belonged to the
minority group.'

"in the South colored folks began organizing themselves
into Eleanor Clubs. One group of domestic servants
banded together as 'daughters of Eleanor.'"
