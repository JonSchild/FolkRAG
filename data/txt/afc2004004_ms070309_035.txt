Be twelve o'clock then the bell would
ring.

They'd stay there and talk and go on 
till day come.

Preacher Rowe used to blow John
Henry on a harp. He'd square dance
& round dance. "We been in this Delta
since 1901.
"Mrs. Rowe - comes from the hills." I 
was scared of all these folks down here.  They
didn't care what they'd do or when
they'd do it." When we come here,
they was rough. W'dn't let you
come here. They'd follow you
right on. King Anderson still
won't let you.  Just hatefulness.
Just meanness.  Cause of the
trouble in the world today."
Tells of Egyptians coming through
full of lodestones -- could cure people--
could throw back bullets--could lift
a wagon wheel by just passing his
hands over it --
