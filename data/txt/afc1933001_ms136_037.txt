Dear Harold,
Enclosed is my year's report. I finally wrote 
it out yesterday after two or three days of 
preparation and of trying to get it done. If
I have not done it before, it has been because 
it literally wasn't in me to do. I have attempted
[to begin] it several times, but it was not 
until yesterday after a few days relaxation
 in the sun, that I could manage 
it. 
As this goes in the mail. I shall return 
to Detroit and see what [can be] has been done
about finding the machine. I'll
write you again before I sleep.
Sincerely, 
Alan

top of page 14. It can be found in the Archive file
