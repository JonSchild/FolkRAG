The Pasadena Art Museum, Mrs. Eve Eshelman, Director 1963
I am personally very grateful to you for coming to the 
Pasadena Art Museum.  Everything thatt we had heard about 
your group before was surpassed by the reaction that I 
had from the people who heard you in performance.  [*5*]

Charleston News and Courier, 1964:  Alan Lomax:  
Alan Lomax's description of the first concert given by 
the GSIS to their own people:
Ab audience of farmers and rural workers sat rapt in pleasure 
as the famous GSIS performed the music of thier great-grandfathers.  
An electric current of discovery ran through 
the hall, the thrill of a people finding that they were 
carriers of a worthy tradition, that what they knew was 
of interest to the whole wide world.  [*7*]
