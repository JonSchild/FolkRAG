LOMAX  [UNCLEAR]
REED  Twenty-one years, yes sir.
LOMAX  Has been. . .
REED  Proud of it.
LOMAX  Right.  Has been a. . . 
REED  Been a challenge and a dare and at the same time something that
some people didn't think could be done, you know.  And always pessimism on us.
She said that the language itself would be dead 45 years and that was 35 years
ago and it's more alive today than its ever been I think, as a second language.
And the Cajun finally got his pride back and his original language.  And that's
one of the reasons that I came  back in 1946.  Influenced a little bit by the Spanish-American,
New Mexico, where I'd been teaching, when I saw they were guarding
their own culture and language almost [hearsay] when we tried to bring down
the barrier of the Spanish people in the ground school.  The rebelled violently
against it.  Came down here in Louisiana and found it just the opposite.  They
were looking forward to it almost.  And everybody thought that was a, just another
dead language, almost a dead relating language.  And until 1946 when your GIs
came back from World War II and saw the value of a second language did they start
more or less fighting for it.
     So here I am after twenty-one years, still kicking.  And I hope to go on
to tackle [UNCLEAR] more.  I enjoy it.  It's an imense pleasure to me up to now.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  Yes, I would say more like a [UNCLEAR] type thing.  Some
of the stuff we can't translate in French it got to come out in English, you know.
Sort of a [Unglais] I guess you could all it, [between] my side kick here
and. . . .but it is primarly Cajun.  We try to keep it as Cajun as we can.  If one
of them gets tangled up in too much English I should call down [UNCLEAR] calls them
down.  [BACKGROUND CROWD NOISES INCREASING]  I have no idea, radio wise, you
mean?  Listening audience?  I don't know, but this program goes out, they pick
me up on the Gulf of Mexico which is about 150 miles.  And I was picked up in Lake
Charles, [UNCLEAR] Beach and as far as [Orange,] Texas, up to [Plats Spring],
around. . .it's not a big. . . .
LOMAX  That's the Cajun world though.
REED  That's the Cajun world. That's Arcadiana, they call it.
And like I said. . .we enjoy it immensely.
LOMAX  You've written a book about the Cajuns.  It's the first book in
the Cajun language, as I understand it.
REED  The book [UNCLEAR], which I intend to revive and possibly
translate at a later date, is, concerns a little bit of what I do or want to
revive.  In that case the old customs and traditions of story telling.  Most of
my stuff is done by, through the tales of the Cajuns.  Now what they believed then
and what they didn't believe then and what they [UNCLEAR] and including some
kind of religion and what they didn't.  It all comes out in their songs and their
stories.  And that was the idea of [UNCLEAR], at the same time keep it going.
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE]
REED  The men or the women?
LOMAX  Both.
REED  The Cajun family was a close knit family, believed in isolation.
They almost call it the glory of isolation, the Bayou [INAUDIBLE] right
up through.  They didn't carry [INAUDIBLE] the Americans that took over in
[1804, whatever], it, double the size of the United States, the Louisiana Purchase.
[UNCLEAR] pass a law to force the Cajun children to go to school from the age
of 6 to 16.  Paris wouldn't let them go because they knew that they'd learn English, 
and when they'd learn English they'd forget their French and their French culture.
And [UNCLEAR] go all the way where they said they'd lose their religion
