TAPE 11: HAMISH HENDERSON.
The Mucking o' Geordie's Byre:
1)  In a lea rig aul croft ayont the hill
Justo roon the neuk frae Sprottie's mill,
Tryin' all his life the time to kill
Lives Geordie McIntyre.
He had a wife as sweir as himsel',
A dochter as black as old Nick is in hell,
There was plenty of fun awa' at this mill
At the muckin' o' Geordie's byre.
Chorus:
2)  The graip was tint, the besom was deen,
The barra it wadna row its lean,
And sich'n a sicht there never was seen
As the muckin' o' Geordie's byre.

2)  The dochter had to strae and neap,
The old wife started to swipe the greep,
When Geordie fell sklite on a rotten heap
At the muckin' O' Geordie's byre.
Ben the greep came Geordie's sow.
And she sat doon shint the cow,
The cow kicket oot and what a stew
At the muckin' o' Geordie's byre.

3)  The boar, he left the midden dyke
And ower the wall wi' Geordie's tyke,
They baith fell into a bumbie's bike
At the muckin' o' Geordie's byre.
The cocks and hens began to crow,
When Biddie astride the sow they saw,
The postie shat, he ran awa at the muckin' o' Geordie's byre.

4)  A hundred years hae passed and mair
Wha' Sprottie's was the hill I speir,
The crofter lassies ye'll see nae mair
At the muckin8 o' Geordie's byre.
His folks are dead and awa lang syne,
Sae in case his memory ye should tyne,
Just whistle the tune to keep ye in mind of
The muckin' o' Geordie's byre.

Lomax: Tell me about the song, where it was made and what kind of 
people sung it first.
Hamish: It's one of the bothy ballads. It was already in a collection
when Burns was born, this particular song, and so it's an 18th
century folksong. It comes from the Highlands of Aberdeenshire,
Kincardin, where the people today make more bothy ballads of that type.
