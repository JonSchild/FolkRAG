SPIRITUALS

Lord, what a mornin' when the stars begin to fall,
Hell is uncapped an burnin',
de dry bones come a-creepin'
De dragon shall be loosened, shout, shout Satans about.

You may bury me in the East, you may bury me in the West,
But I'll hear de trumpet sound in dat mornin'

When I was lost in de wilderness,
King Jesus hand me a candle down.

Oh, He call you by de lightnin',
He call you by de thunder
He call you by de middle night cry
Oh come home, come home, my Father's children.
An' He ain't got weary yit.

When I was a mourner jes' like you,
My feet got wet with the midnight dew
My knees got 'quainted with the hillside, too.

Long grave and short grave
Everywhere I go

Jacob's ladder, slim an' tall;
Haven't got Jesus, you shuly fall.

One of them mornings bright and fair
Gwine to hitch my wings and try the air.

Well, the grave must be an awful place,
Lay a man on his back, throw dirt in his face.
