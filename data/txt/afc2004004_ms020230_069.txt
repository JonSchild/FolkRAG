[*(OFF SEASON)*]
BJ:    Oh, yeah, this keeps goin' on. . .No, it[â€˜s] it keeps goin' on
in the winter; it doesn', you know, beans can't make in the summer,
when it's hot.   It's too hot.  That's right.  The muck's too hot.
TL:    What do you do during the summer to work?
BJ:    Oh, well, I. . . I didn't have to do anything, y-you see!   Ha, ha,
ha!  I'll tell you!  As I tol' ya before, I had a way of livin'.  I'd look out for
ahead of time.   I always did, in that way.
TL:    Yeah, what. . . 
BJ:    Huh?
TL:    . . . what did you do?
BJ:    Well, jus', ah, fish or, ah, you know, sometime I have washin'
an' ironin' for peoples ya know, like that.  The white peoples
what's in the place.   I did that a whole lot, but not. . .
TL:    You didn't mostly pick?  You didn't pick too much?
BJ:    It, it, it wasn't nothin' to pick in the summer.  Ya see?
Nothin' to do in the summer but go to church an' enjoy yourself
an', an' ride aroun' an' fish.  Set aroun' an' have fun an' like
that.  But [not, not] now, ah, it's nothin', it's nothin' to do until
time to plant again. . . Um-hum.
       I stayed there five years that way. 
TL:    Five years!
BJ:    Yeah.  I mean year on, on the lake.
TL:    Where did you go after you picked beans, Bessie?
BJ:    I s-- I didn't go anywhere, 'le-'lessen I wanna go off somewhere 
else t' work an' I never hardly did that.   But once I went
off to work a lil' while an' come back.
TL:    Where did you go?
BJ:    [Ah,] I, I went down in Miami an' worked a while an' come back.
TL:    An' what did you do down there?
