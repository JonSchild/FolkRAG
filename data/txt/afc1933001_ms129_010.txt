"THE RANGE OF BUFFALO."

It was in the town of Jacksboro,about the year of Seventy three,
I hadn't been there so very long until old Crago came to me;
Said he my jolly young fellow how would you like to go,
and spend one pleasant summer in the range of Buffalo?

Me being out of employment these words to him did say,
"Oh in the range of Buffalo it depends upon the pay;
If you will pay good wages and transportation too,
It's likely I'll go with you to the range of Buffalo."

There was twenty two in number that went aboard the train,
Twenty two in number strong able-bodied men;
The ride it was a pleasant one the road we had to go,
Till we crossed Peters river to the range of Buffalo.

Our fun then it was over our troubles just begun,
The first bulls tail I went to split Oh Christ I split my thumb;
Peters river its a salty one the Gypsies surely know,
God grant there's no worse hell on earth than the range of Buffalo.

When our summers work was ended to old Crago we went for pay,
He said you've been so extravagant that I'm in debt this day;
We called our arms together to show him that would not do,
We left old Crago's bones to bleach out among the Buffalo.

Come all you young jolly boys this warning take from me,
If you are bent on roving some pleasure sure to see;
I've told you of my troubles and this I surely know,
That there is no worse hell on earth than the Range of Buffalo.

I have known this song for
over fifty years. I learned it
from Archie [Hummisurchen?] [?]
come from the mountains of
Virginia.
