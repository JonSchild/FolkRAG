Tape: Roll 45 Stan and Ray Hicks    5
Ray: He opened the sack, just like he held it, and Death spewed
out...it went in there, tied up! And when it come out, left the
sack, he just fell over dead! And all the rest, wherever they's
at! Everybody that was in the place to die! Yeah, that was in 
sick enough to die. And all the other ones didn't. It was just
the ones sick enough to die, livin' because Death was in the sack.

Jack, they finally called him to the army, the war, and he spent
30 years. And all you got back then, was two loaves of light brea[d]
and a suit of clothes when they discharged you, didn't matter how
long you stayed, unless you got extra loaves of light bread. And
so he started home, and hit a little town, and a beggar got on to
him for one of those loaves of bread, and he give him one, a whole
loaf. And then he went on out to the edge of town and he met up
with another one. He took his knife and cut it in half, and gave
him a half of one. He got on a few steps more and got to study, h[e]
cheated that last beggar! He gave the first one a whole loaf and 
just give him half. He run back and overtook him, got it on his
mind, and he says, "now I'm gonna give you something', I got a sack
here, if anything gets to botherin' you, just say 'whickitywack,
into this sack'...
Technician: Do that again, sorry...
Ray: Said "I'm gonna give you something', bein' you was so clever to
come back to overtake me, to give me, to be right, I'll give you
something. Here's a sack. All you have to do is open it, get it
between your legs and look at what you want to get in there, and
say "whickitywack, in to this sack!' and it'll just crawl and stuf[f]
down right in that. Here's a drinkin' glass. If they gonna die,
