First of Ten Pictures Is
Completed at New City Farm

Songs of An Earlier America to Be Subjects 
for Series of Short Movies

The buff and white kitten stretched out in a battered felt
hat gave a tremendous stretched its legs, then closed
its eyes to curl up contentedly. Four watching men looked 
up, grinned and then one of them pressed a button.

"O.K. Cut it," said Willard VanDycke, Roger Barlowe,
assistant camera man for Brandon Films, stopped the
whirring camera. With the cessation of that sound, the 
shooting of the final bit of footage 
for the first of ten films to be
made in Rockland County locales
came to and end at the Durland
Farm, Strawtown Road.

For three weeks a group of
sectors, singers, and technicians together 
with Director VanDycke
and Producer Tom Brandon had 
been working around the farm 
busily filming what they hope will
mark a new departure in independent 
moving picture production.
When and if the first film comes
out of the laboratory and cutting
room, it will bring to the people of 
the United States the first of ten
short subjects designed to depict
the background of American folk
songs.

Daylight "Shooting"
Working against time and weather - 
all of the actual filming done
in sunlight - the crew put in six
"shooting days" in the three-week
period. The first of these films
has been tentatively titled "Tall
Tales" and will show the songs as 
"Strawberry Roan," "Grey Goose,"
and "John Henry."

The idea is Brandon's. He is a 
short, soft-spoken redhead, who has 
been in the moving picture business 
for a dozen years. Most of
this time he put in as a distributor 
and producer of independent
films, mainly for educational purposes. 
The scheme came to him,
he says, after he saw a recent 
trend toward songs that had their
beginnings in the early history of
America. Most of these songs he
has heard for years but some have 
been brought out in albums and 
others presented via the radio.

Interest in Old Songs
"With all this interest in early
American songs, the songs of the 
people as they founded this country 
and then stretched westward
to the Pacific, it seemed to be a 
good time to initiate a project like
this," he explained. Burton went
on to say that in conceiving this 
plan, he did not want the backgrounds 
for the films to be in any 
way "stagy" nor did he want to
have them filmed against a synthetic 
set.

"Such a project, to my mind,
called for an authentic background, 
for a 'folk quality' in it,
and demanded as close a natural
background as possible. With that
in mind, I began a search for an
outdoor locale, preferably close to
New York City. In making a survey 
of the surrounding territory,
we hit on Rockland County about
a month ago. The more we surveyed 
it, the more it looked as
though this county contained more
natural backgrounds, suitable for
our purposes, than any other place
we had hit. To me, it appears that
we can re-capture the authentic
backgrounds of almost any portion 
of the country, with the possible 
exception of the Florida Everglades.

Production Started
"We found the people here very
co-operative and interested. Then,
suddenly, I realized that with a 
county so well populated with ac-
