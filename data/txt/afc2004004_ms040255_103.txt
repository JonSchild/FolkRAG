  As for the traditional that depends on
the person - There are some [peple] people
who would sing a song to you in a straight
line - the bare notes as you would say
There are others who would color them
Still keeping to the same [x] melody, [still]
[keeping the same] but coloring the notes
with graces - or

Reel II, 1]  Young Allistair son of Michel I wish I could
                                       give you a son,
Five or six or seven sons
I would nurse them all carefully
I " have them on my knee & breastfeed them fully
I would lift them up in my arms & carry them on
                                          my shoulder
I would go with them to Lewis
To the pretty village in the Clochan

To the big new house
And wine wd be drunk at
        the christening.
Red wine & colored wine
I would give each one 
a trade.

Another one a drover, another one a policeman
  "            "  wd be a clerk & write me from London
            [end]

Sad, sad am I climbing the mts
That I can't see brothers coming
I'm sure that wherever you are tonight
There will be merriment & fun
You'll be playing cards
