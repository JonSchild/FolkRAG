WRITINGS OF MATTIE DEAR....

     x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
     I first want to thank the Lord Jesus that I am yet
alive.  My health is very good, only my feetis very sore from
walking so much.  But I am not walking so much as my heavenly
father did.  But yet it is a wonderful blessing to be on this 
side.
     Now about Alligator and her surrounding. Everything is 
very quiet and we are having good services. But some of us is
going contrary to God's will. It was my aim to go to Clarksdale
Saturday on the train, but I got left. But Mrs. Lutissie Claborn
say to me on the street, "Mattie, don't you want to go to Clarksdale?" 
I says to her, "Yes mam!" Then she say, "Come go with me."
I thanked her. It is a fine thing to treat everybody right. But 
let me tell you that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the
world. Believe it or not.
     Now let me tell you Jesus watches and He is Master of this
house.
     I had a business trip Monday to Clarksdale and I chance
to go to Mr. James Robinson's store and got my beautiful chair
he given to me. O, it is so sweet of him.
S.H. KYLE PLANTATION... By Josie Young...
...A Christmas present Saturday. He hadn't forgot it. He hadn't
saw me. I am very grateful for it. He gave all the tenants a 
New Year's gift, too. Everything is going along fine on this 
place. I hope the snow won't fall this year...
