3.  To furnish all types of stringed instruments, making
them available in the barracks and in the folksong
center.

4.  To furnish instruction books for playing these instruments, 
along with tunes and card diagrams to fit the
types of songs above [disclosed] discussed.

5.  To furnish recordings by folksong virtuosos playing on these
instruments to be used as instruction records by the
men.

6.  There should be a center in camps for this type of
music as opposed and as counter distinction to jazz
and other types of music played from written music
and with complicated arrangements. In these centers
should be found the song leaflets, instruments, instruction 
books described above.

7.  A sound recording machine should visit these camps
once a month to record the best programs by the men
and the songs they have themselves made up. These
records could be reproduced and used, beneficially, to
circulate from one camp to another.

To carry out this program, the Archive of American Folk
Song needs clerical and editorial assistance.
