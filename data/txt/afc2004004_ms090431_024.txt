Fisk, 8. 1. HAFFER
WORK ON STREETS
You know, you see, the way it happens must have been due to the fact 
that the people may come crowd the sidewalks, all that kind of stuff, 
and sometimes that happen. Then sometimes it happens not only, sometimes 
it happens just downright, well, I don't know, it would be 
just downright prejudice, but we have all that kind of stuff.
A: What did they say?
H: Well, so e of em would say, talk nice and some of em talk it rough.
A: What did they say? Don't be afraid to tell me.
H: Well, I don't just know, you have to move, Some of em come up cursing, "Get out of here or we'll put you in jail," talk about 
that, and some of em will say, "Well, I don't want to interfere, what 
you doing is all right, but under the law here we can't do such a thing." Some of em talk nice. And some of em say, "Well, I tell 
you what you do -- get over on theother side of the street where you 
won't block the sidewalk and go right ahead."
A: Do you sell lots of these songs? How many do you sell in a day, for instance?
H: Well, sometimes you sell a good many.
A: Do you make a pretty good living out of your songwriting?
H: Well, it's hard to tell. Now, you see, I don't work every day unless 
it's a convention or 'sociation, you see; I [donâ€™t] work Saturdays.
A: What do you mak in a normal week-end when you have a conventi n 
or something?
H: Well, sometimes when, you know, pressur it on all right, you do 
mighty well.
A: Like about $6 or $10 or what?
E: Well, yessir, most of the time like that.
A: Do you support yourself and your wife entirely by songs, or do you 
have some other sources?
