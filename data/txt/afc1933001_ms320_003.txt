Take a whiff on me
The blacker the berry, de sweeter de juice
Takes a brown skin woman, for my particular use.

I chew my tobaccer, I spit my juice
I love my baby till it aint no use

When I marry goin' to buy me a line
Goin' to whip my baby till she change her min'

When I marry gonna buy me a rope
"Goin' whip her until she buzzard lope #

Went up town actin boss
