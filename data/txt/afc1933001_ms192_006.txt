** ABOARD THE S.S. WILLIAM FLOYD **
SUNG TO THE TUNE OF THE "WABASH CANNON BALL"

ON A WINTRY DAY IN JANUARY WE LEFT OLD NEWPORT NEWS
WITH CARGO TO DELIVER, WE HAD NOT TIME TO LOSE,
IT WAS FOOD AND AMMUNITION FOR THE BOYS IN FOREIGN LANDS
TO FOLLOW OUT THE ORDER OF DEAR OLD UNCLE SAM

*  DON'T YOU HEAR THAT SCREW A TURNING
C  DON'T YOU HEAR THAT ENGINE POUND
H  WE'RE KNOCKING OFF THE TEN KNOTS AN HOUR
O  WE'RE FOREIGN COUNTRY BOUND
R  THEY WILL KNOW THEIR DAYS ARE OVER
U  WHEN OUR BOMBS SHALL THEM DESTROY
S   WE'LL TAKE THEM OVER TO THEM
*  ON THE S.S. WILLIAM FLOYD

OUR CAPTAIN'S KIND AND FAITHFUL
OUR MATES ARE TRUE AND STRONG
BY THE HELP OF OUR DEAR MAKER
IT WON'T TAKE VERY LONG
WE WILL FIGHT OUR COUNTRY'S BATTLE
TO SET ALL PEOPLE FREE
AND WHEN THIS WAR IS OVR
HOW HAPPY WE WILL BE!

TOJO AND HITLER'S DISAPPOINTED
THIS IS ONE THING THAT WE KNOW
SO LET'S KEEP ON A ROLLING
AND KEEP THEM ON THE GO
IF WE ARE TRUE AND FAITHFUL
WE WILL WIN THIS VICTORY
BY HARD WORK AND BY FIGHTING
UPON THIS ROLLING SEA.

SO BOYS LET'S KEEP ON FIGHTING 
AND DO OUR BEST EACH DAY
TO KEEP OLD GLORY WAVING
OUR COUNTRY WE WILL SAVE
OUR FLAG WILL WAVE FOREVER
ABOVE OUR LAND OF THE BRAVE
AND WHEN THE BATTLE'S OVER
WE WILL ALL COME HOME TO STAY.
