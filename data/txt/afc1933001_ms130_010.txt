Dear Alan,
Thank you for sending the
book back. Now I should like
to know if you can locate and
send back the loose manuscript
music I sent with the thesis.
I had written the music for both
clefs for c'est pas la peine,
and Fedora and mailed them
no--expressed them to you
with the thesis. I should like
to have this loose music
if you can find it.
I loved you last sentence
in your letter--so much in
so few words.
Lots of good wishes to you
and to Mrs Lomax
Sincerely,
Irene
