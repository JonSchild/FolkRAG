Mr. Alan Lomax


talk might well follow the lines laid down in Mr. 
MacLeish's introduction and your own preface. You
will know the interest of listeners in concrete
details and incidents, and can, I am sure, give us
very appetizing glimpses of the book. In general
I think our purpose should be to let listeners know
about this book in particular - the things that might 
lead them to buy it and enjoy it themselves - and also
about your work in general.

The broadcast will be returned to Chicago after your
talk. I would like to have you use approximately
six minutes.

I shall be glad for word from you at your convenience
regarding these possibilities. I shall look forward
with very real pleasure to hearing you on December
27.

Cordially yours,
