New York City and Fifth Avenue

this person introduces and concludes each [?]

Talkin' to my baby,
Oh------------O
An' I donT mean maybe;
When I get back to Louisiana, gonna walk an' talk,
Tell ev'body 'bout the city of New York.
Oh------------O,
Talkin' to my baby,
Oh------------O,
Don' mean maybe,
When I get back to Louisiana, tell 'em about the mighty shock,
Tell 'em New York City is built on a solid rock.
Oh------------O.

There's two things I want you to do,
When you get to New York City, go to Fifth Avenue.
When you get to New York gonna turn around,
See Fifth Avenue, the longest street in town.

When I get back to Louisiana, the people singin' "Stormy Weather",
You go to Dallas and New Orleans, Fifth Avenue hold more people
than the two towns put together,

You can go to Dallas and you can go to New Orleans,
But you go up Fifth Avenue and you see more people that you
ever seen.

People was singin' wid a doleful sound,
Get on Fifth Avenue, get a petition to a hole in the ground.

It's thun'din' and lightnin' and it looks like rain,
In the hole in the ground you see them subway trains.

I get back to Louisiana, gonna walk and tell,
New York City is a burning Hell.
Oh------------O,
Tell you all about it,
Oh------------O,
Tell you all aboutit------------etc.
