     I was so glad she found it, I didn't know what to do!  I
was glad she foun' it.  Me, I was the one glad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Yeah, I was the one glad.
     But didn't know how to carry it back to her.  That was so
funny.  I thought of it many times ['bout] an' how, if I'd been real,
you know, had been experienced of anything, I would have called
an' told her that I found it here, you see.  But I figure she
might thought I stole it, an' meant it, ya know, an' I jus' I jus' carry it
on out there an' give it to her, you see.
