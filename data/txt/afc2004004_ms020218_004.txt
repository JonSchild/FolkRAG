day they kep' worrin' me so bad. I was washin' [-- you know] an'
I was workin' an' tired an' from one thing to the other. "Mama, he
hit me; Joe took my this." An' this an' the other. Outside. Melvin [Patsy's 
husban' now] "Say, Mama..."cried. Patsy's, Patsy's husban' now...
they all was out...they jus' cuttin' up so bad[...they's] that day; they's
worrin' me so bad an' they hittin' one another. Said, "Now, you stop
hittin' when I tol' you I don't want you all fightin' one another." So,
I said, "I'm gonna break this up" I wen' out there that day an'
I got me a good string, a good strong string offa apron I had. I took
that string an' I tied the two lef' han's together, my boys; I tied
the two lef' han's caught that way together. That give them the
two right han's free. Then I went an' got me two good switches an'

I put one in each one of em's han's. "Now you whup one another." I
said, "I tired you tellin' me 'bout he hittin' me an' then/hit the other.
I'm workin' (I gotta get away?) (I said get out the way?). So, an'
ah, you see, one couldn't get loose from the other. They pull this
way an' pull that way. Baby George look at Joe, he said, "Joe, don't
ya hit me." An' Joe said, "George, don't ya hit me." He said, "Don't
hit me; don't hit me" Ha, an so they walkin' 'round and 'round that
yard. "Don't hit me, don't hit me." I say "Hit 'im." I walk around,
say, "Hit 'im, hit 'im Joe." "Jis' don' hit me, Joe." They lookin' at
one another; they ain' lookin' me a bit. I lookin' right there, [I]
watchin' 'em. I say, Hit 'em, Joey." "Joe, don't hit me." "Hit 'im
Joe!" "Dontcha hit me." An' thas' all they done; ovah there swingin'.
Had a reg'lar trail all around the[y] yard the way they walkin'. I [tell]
turn them loose an' I ain' never had no more trouble with 'em. If they hit one
another, I didn't know it no more.  Heh! They finally got tired of
it' they didn't dare hit one another. One was scared of...they couldn't
loose. They coulda swung...heh...an...heh...that was good for 'em.
I did that myself; I thought that up. I ain't had no more trouble
with 'em fightin'. From that day to this. Well, that
was the funniest thing to me; I wisht I had a Kodak to take that
picture. Jes' goin' around...one...another...an' had, one had of 'em
had the switch drawn back. "Don't [whip] hit me." I said, "Hit 'em!"
"Don't hit me." Ha, ha, ha, ha!
AL: Bessie, ah...
BJ: Ha, ha. I had to do sumpin'. 'Cause you can't beat a chile
for everything they do. I declare, you kill them, you know. An'
