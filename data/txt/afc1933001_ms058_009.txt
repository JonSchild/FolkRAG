Mr. John A. Lomax # 2.

I'll just wait until you are up in this neck of the woods, some
of these days and if you then still want them, then I shall be
glad to play them for you.

I have never heard from Mr. Adrian J. Dornbush, of 1619 30th. St.,
N.W., Washington, D.C.

I guess that they will get some " pretty boy " from Hollywood
that don't know a cow from a giraffe, to sing their cowboy
songs on or about June 10th./ 1939.

I don't see why they don't just get some " baby-face " young
fellow to present all the Old time records, also, in fact the
most of those things are nothing but a lot of b.s. anyway.

Anyway, I'm not going to fall out with my friend, Mr. Lomax, about
just any arrangement that is made because most all those things
are generally, nothing but a lot of B---- S----.

Yours Respectfully,
Jess Morris  S -
