War Stories

There were two privates who had
just come to the army, and they
didn't know the Army slang. One
day the Officers called the men
togeather and asked who wanted
to be G-man. The men who
knew the slag looked at each
because they knew what G-man
duty was but the men who
had just entered didn't. One of
the new men stepped out and
said "I will be G-man," so the
officer looked at him and
said allright you'll be garbage
man.

There was a rumor going
around, saying that hitler was
dead. There was another
rumor which said hitler was
sick.

There was a woman who went
to the store to buy some meat. [*Folder 120*]
