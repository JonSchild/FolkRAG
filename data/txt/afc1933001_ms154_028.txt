MEMORANDUM

TO THE
LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS

FROM THE Division of Music
February 17, 1940

REFERRING TO Memo from Arch A. Mercey

1. Mr. Mercey's interest is very encouraging to say the least.

2. Nor knowing Mr. Ivens, I cannot comment on Mr. Mercey's opinion
of him. On the other hand, I have felt the same way about certain
foreigners working in the field of American folk-music. If there should
be any doubt about Mr. Ivens' feeling for the native idiom, I should
certainly recommend that an American-born director be sought in his stead.

3. I believe that we always had a division of labor in mind. In
fact, if this film is made, I sincerely hope that A. MacLeish (Poet) will
play an important part in its creation. Dr. Botkin can be very useful as
can several others who come to mind - Alan Lomax, for instance.

4. Mr. Harris is anxious to come to Washington to resume the discussion
about his proposed project. When I spoke to him in New York on
Tuesday, he asked me to set a date when you would be in town. Since he
is willing to remain for a few days, the meeting proposed by Mr. Mercey
might take place about the same time. Please let me have your suggestions.
