AL: Well, anyway, there's lots of Ellers up around here. . .
this is the Eller settlement up along here, isn't it? Your 
family's been living here many a year, haven' they? It used
to be very different in the days you were growing up, didn't it?
Eller: Like I said, if some of 'em had learned the banjo lik e
I did when they were coming up, they wouldn't learn it so fast.
AL: Why, what was your trouble in those days?
Eller: Well, I didn't have no music lessons or nothing, all
I knowed was this"random", just listening- yeah, that's what
they call it. You never heard it called that?
Al: No, I din't, I love it. Random, that's they best.
Well, play us another random one. What about. . . .that one about 
the shoes that you played. . . . .
