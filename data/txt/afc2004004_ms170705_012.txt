Adventures on the road. McBeth

There was one time when I was along the road and it was
very, very dark. It was dark in this wood, and I had a good
bit to go through there, about five miles, and wood on both
sides of me, and of course the moon was shining, too. And I
thought there was something moving in front of me, and just
meself there, you see. But I'd had a good drinking -- oh a
great drinking, and I was --- tipsy! And I saw this thing
moving in front of me; and when I moved it moved along with
me, a hundred yard in front of me. And I stood up and it stood
up and when I moved to one side it moved, too, and darn it, I
thought it was something standing in front of me. So I had a 
bottle of beer in my pocket and I took a swig of it and said
"Here goes, I'll face it, whatever it is." So up I goes, right
in front of me, and do you know what it was? A pool of water.
It was the moon shining in the pool of water. . . . .and my God,
I walked right into the pool of water and stood about half an
hour looking at it before I went on. . . . .
