Help the war effort by making a
victory garden.

The teacher said to Bob, did you wash
all the dirt from behind your ears,
and he said, look at them now. I
am going to plant a victory garden.

A lady was cleaning out her attic +
the scrap man came to the door
and said, do you have any old papers
books or rags + she said, I am
cleaning out my attic. I will see.
Her little boy went up to the attic
with the scrap man and he was
looking around at the different
things. The man said I'll give
you 5 cents for this + the little boy
said, sold. His mother said, why
did the scrap man hurry away
and the little boy said, I sold
him one of those old cases of canned
goods for 5 cents.
