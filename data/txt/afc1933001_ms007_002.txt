Alan Lomax, Esq.
General Delivery
New Orleans, La

My dear Mr. Lomax:

   I am much concerned to learn from your postal, received this 
morning, that your Father is ill and at the hospital. I hope that
he will rapidly overcome the attack and be able to resume his trip
without much delay. Kindly give him my regards and good wishes
for a speedy recovery.
As regards the machine, I am much relieved to hear that it is 
working more satisfactorily and that what you at first thought were
defects of the apparatus have proved to be - quite explicable - defects 
in your technique. The tests that I witnessed in New York were
surprisingly good. I am sure that your own recordings will very soon 
equal them. 

                                                              Faithfully yours,
                                                                      Chief, Division of Music
