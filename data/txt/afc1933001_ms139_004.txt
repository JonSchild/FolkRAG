Mrs. Ruth R. Roark
Mozelle, Ky.

Dear Mrs. Roark:

I am grieved to hear of your father's death.
I remember him as a fine gentleman and a delightful
musician.

As I recall I sent Mr. Collett a copy of one
or two of his records shortly after my return from
Kentucky in 1937.

Perhaps you do not know of these records and
they might suffice for the time being. We do not have
here at the Library at the moment the best facilities
for duplication and your father's original records should
not be played unnecessarily as they might show wear.

If you feel it is possible for you to wait
perhaps a year for additional duplicates, at that time
I believe you may be able to obtain duplicates of such
better quality for by then we hope to have regular
facilities for duplication in this division.

I am deeply touched by your request and if
you feel that you need a record at once I will do my
best to make one for you.

With sincere sympathy, I am

Very truly yours,
