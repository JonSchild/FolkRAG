I will be so glad when this war
is over. I wish and pray each
minute of the day that whoever
has the authority would bring
this terrible situation to an end
by some means. From our
sacrifices that we are called to
make, it seems that the war would
be over this week. Nothing is
ever gained by war that is greater
than the losses.
