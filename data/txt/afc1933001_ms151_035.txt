Dear Mr. Lomax:

We wish to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of
the 21st with further reference to the selection "Oh,
Didn't He Ramble".

The data which you now supply is quite ample, we believe,
to take care of the question before us, and we greatly
appreciate your trouble in sending it to us.

                                             Very truly yours,

                                                     H. C. Darnell  w.
                                                Manager of Copyright Section.
