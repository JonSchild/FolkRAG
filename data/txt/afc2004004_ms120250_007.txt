Che' Neg',

If there were only some way I could tell you how much I think of you,
how your image and the holy inner feeling of being close to you runs
through all my day. But there is [????] evidently some sort of an
iron plate inside me against which my feelings exhaust themselves,
because if [they're] there were not this bitter protective shell I would
long ago have gone away and left this place with all its lonliness behind. 
I wondered tonight what I could be made of. I read over again
all your letters and they ground into my heart and sped through my breast
until I was fainting with pain, pain that you were so glorious and perhaps
loved me no longer that the [glorious] marvelous things that flashed
and danced and shouted in all those letters was gone out of the world
and out of my life, pain that I had hurt you so many times, pain with 
the knowledge that there was nothing important that I could ever give you
and that perhaps what I am will strangle and cloud this bright brilliant
spirit, pain at being reminded again of how far away everything we have 
had together now seems( even though at the same time I could  not believe,
because I cannot allow this acid to touch my mind for more thn an instant,
that what you had told me in all those letters had suddenly vanished;
and yet when the last word of those letters had been read I went calmly
to my supper with the usual expression I wear at such time on my face
and talked French for an hour with two upper-class French boys. Not that
I didn't feel hollow and ill inside , but I enjoyed the conversation and
wasn't at all absentminded. Simply another example, I suppose, of the
marvellous ability of the human organism to endure. If what I sometimes
supposeis true, I shall, as you well know, do nothing extravagant, but
people will have lost all their importance and I shall grow more selfish
and ugly and more of me will turn into straw. Living will have the feeling 
of sand and hay and the Gods will have fallen from their pedastles.[not]
....Darling, perhaps this seems extravagant , but it is not in view of the 
pace I live here. You will understand after I have written on for a long
time about Port-au-Prince and Haiti what it means not to have even a lin{e}
from you for two weeks. Life is closer to me here than it ever was before.
People live in the streets, their whole lives. [All t] Little blac{k}
babies pissing in the gutters and waving their little penises in the 
air unashamed,. The dances where the whole [sexual intercourse] of the danc{e}
of the bed is caricatured from the first advances through the courtship 
and entrance to the last wrenching leap[ing] of the body in orgasm. This
morning on the mountain I walked through the whole of the lives of million{s}
of people on the earth. [An] A woman in a blue dress and holding her baby
sat on the hard clean white clay of her front yard while her man sat at
the corner of their one room hut , [i] made [of layers] the wood, the [y]
straw, the palm leaves, of that same mountain, leaned and smoked his pipe
nd did not look at the woman but at the fat nanny goat baaing around the
corner. Down the street a little fow-terrier puppy sat and shivered in the
sun ill with the disease of hunger; and all the dogs here are like that
thin and whining and shivering; I have the feeling that they and their
masters mutually hate each other; they are competitors for the food-supply.
Then there was the country store. A bare-footed woman in blue denim and
with the eternal red bandana about her greasy head standing at the edge of
the road under the open sky by her little table. By her feet were a couple
of bundles of split fire-wood, a basket of charcoal, and a small calabash
with a little starch. On here little table she had offered up to the travele
