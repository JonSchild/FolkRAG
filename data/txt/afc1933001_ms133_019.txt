Professor John Umble,
Goshen College,
Goshen, Indiana.

Dear Professor Umble;

I hope you can forgive me for not having replied sooner to your very kind letter. I think you are most gracious in not holding me responsible for Mr. Bontrager's reaction to his first experience with folk-lore, since I do feel now that perhaps if I had emphasized more strongly the official nature of the recordings he might not have responded as he did.

I have discussed your suggestion of a letter from President Roosevelt with the Librarian and he feels that perhaps this should be our last resort. He suggested that later, when Congress has departed and the President is a little less busy, we might arrange to play for him one or two Amish records and ask him for a statement of appreciation at that time.

In the meantime, however, the Librarian will write Mr. Bontrager on the most official Library stationery and thank him in the most official manner possible for his songs. Would you be kind enough to let us know what effect this thank-you has on our sturdy singer? What is Mr. Bontrager's address?

I hope that perhaps he will have changed his mind by the end of June because I expect to be passing through Northern Indiana and I should very much like to re-visit the Amish community in your company and make further recordings. The material I recorded last spring was most unusual. I look forward to seeing you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
