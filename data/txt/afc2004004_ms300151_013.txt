Dear Mr. Lomax:

        To further clarify my letter of September 11th, the negative
balance referred to is a result of returns, and not any advance
against writers' royalties. As I explained, any details would
have to come from Hill & Range.

        No notice of the sale of Progressive Music was given to
individual third parties, inasmuch as the entire business, including
the name, was sold as a unit. In other words, there is simply a 
change in management. At the time, there were stories in all the
trade papers reporting the sale. Any future reports will still
come from Progressive Music Publishing Company.

Very truly yours,

ATLANTIC RECORDING CORPORATION
