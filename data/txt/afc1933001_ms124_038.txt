Mrs. Edings Whaley Wilson
Martins Point, S. C.

Dear Mrs. Wilson:

Thank you for your kind and interesting letter and for the
list of singers. We will greatly appreciate all the additional
information you can send us in regard to Plantation Echoes.

I regret to inform you that I shall not be in Washington
during September and that the Library is taking no active part
in the Sesquicentenial Celebration. It is being directed Mr.
Sol Bloom, Representative. from New York.

As concerns the re-recording of the spirituals and songs of
Plantation Echoes, John A. Lomax has perhaps told you that we are
not yet equipped to do the work. When we have the equipment we will
then be in a better position to discuss the matter.

I am indeed sorry that you cannot come to Washington to tell me
about Plantation Echoes, both because of the assistance you could
render the Archive and because I should like very much to meet you.
Perhaps that will be at the World Fair. In the meantime, however,
your letters will prove of great assistance to us.

Thanking you again for your kind letter, I am

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk-Song
