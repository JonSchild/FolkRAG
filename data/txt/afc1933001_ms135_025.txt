Re: Alan Lomax Plan 

July 11, 1938

This is an extremely well written plan - it shows
that the writer has a comprehensive understanding of locales
throughout the country rich in folk lore. Many of his suggestions
are now under consideration and are being developed 
by us and the Concessions Department. For example, there is 
a deal pending with the Federal Theatre Project to utilize 
some of their best valudeville acts on small platforms throughout
the Fair Grounds.

The Negro Honky-tonk has been let as a concession
to the owners of the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem.

The Dutch Tavern will be built and sponsored by
the Heineken Beer Company.

The Hawaiian entertainment will be provided in the 
South Sea Islands Village.

I was pleased to read his description of the incidental
folk and professional entertainment of the minstrel
character, as I am placing great importance upon the diversified
type of entertainment which will breathe life into certain 
sections of the Exhibit Area.
