Mr. E. C. Beck
State Norall School
Mount Pleasant, Michigan

Dear Mr. Beck:

    Recently while I was on a ballad collecting tour, Alan
Lomax gave permission to Howell, Soskin & Company, Inc. Pub-
lishers, to use the song "Meesh-e-gan, which you had previously
allowed me to use in American Ballads and Folk Songs. As origi-
nal finder of that song, I judge that the enclosed check belongs
to you.

    I've often recalled the pleasant visit I had with you
at Mount Pleasant and have been trying to come back to see you.
    Sincerely yours,

    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Curator and Consultant
