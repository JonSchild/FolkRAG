Round Lake, Mich. 

"I met Miss Monroe in the morning, 
Her petticoat dripping with blood
I asked her, "What [the devil] was the matter
An says she I've been fucked by a stug
Chorus:
An its [?] bout my naked belly
An tickle my old fusee 
And oiled the hair around [my] your ass
We're off on a Hell of a spree.
