Dear Alan:

Miss Terrill and I are here
to record the songs of Mrs. Nancy
Griffin, the old blind lady at Hasse, Texas.[*x*]
She is in much better [help] health and
singing form than when you saw her.
When I went in she said, "When is 
Alan coming to see me? I keep his picture
and the articles about my singing
in the candy box he gave me. I ate
on that candy a long time and saved
it as long as I could." Also she
told me, "I am giving you these songs
because Alan was so nice to me."
You'd add some stars to your 
crown if you'd send that
