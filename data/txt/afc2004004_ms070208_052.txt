July 25 [24]. Spent a fine day with my old
[Cro] cronies - Muddy Waters, Son Simms
and their friends on the Stovall Place. -
five miles East. Planned another session
for Monday. They really like me, kept
mentioning Elizabeth. I miss her damn badly.
     Read a putrid novel - The Girls by
Edna Ferber before I slept at two.
