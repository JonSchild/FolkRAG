Wednesday.
Yesterday was one of those
anxious days that come before
writing. I leafed through
scores of books, talked &
visited, was furious at Seamus
Ennis whom I had told not 
to come around for not
coming around.
At last about 6 I got
down to business and
including Seamus's visit which
began at 9 and ended at 11
finally worked off most of
the final outline problems &
went home jubilantly to sleep.
I discover that I'm so
lonely that I talk to myself
& keep my hands in my
pockets all the time,
touching the only thing
