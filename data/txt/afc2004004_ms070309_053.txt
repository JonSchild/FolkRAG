July 20. 
Yesterday I interviewed also Miss Chapman
-60+ - white piano teacher for Clarksdale.
She came here from the hill country when there
weren't but [2 or 3] a few houses in the town.
[Her] She lived here for several years, going
away for her piano lessons, resolved to 
come back [if] and teach here someday.
Was the first teacher of music in the community, 
trained pupils who now teach
music all over Mississippi,. In the early
days they went to New Orleans for the Opera
sometimes, had very elegant and by-invitation 
only dances in the houses with stringed orchestras,
had serenades during the winter with
the serenaders playing Stephen Foster , Sweet
Adoline, etc. & [later] afterwards invited
in to the houses for refreshments. they 
loved the beautiful old negro spirituals,
sing them now sometimes at community
song-fests. They liked Handy's band and 
used Handy's and Mangrum's band
to serenade successful political candidates. 
For the last few years she has managed 
a concert series in the local theatre 
and they have been quite successful
