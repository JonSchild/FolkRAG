Dear Mr. Outram:

The exact texts for the two songs you request
can, unfortunately, only be obtained from the records
which you heard. Neither of these records happens to
have come from the Archive's collection. In fact, I
believe them to be dubbings from commercial recordings
which you may be able to buy. This information would
have to come from Alastair Cooke, since he chose the
recordings originally. The text to the "Night Herding
Song", however, you can find on page 60 of "Cowboy
Songs", by J.A. Lomax, New York, The Macmillan Company,
1938. I believe the text of the other song is
in the "Hobo's Hornbook", by George Milburn, New York,
I. Washburn, 1930.

I would have answered your letter before, but I
have been away on a long field recording trip.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
in the Library of Congress
