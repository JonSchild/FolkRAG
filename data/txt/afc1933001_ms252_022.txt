Johnny, too precious to be fed
into the maw of the maniac,
Hitler, He is top condition 
physically and mentally.

I'll try to the right thing
about the manuscript, and 
I appreciate your frank 
statement. The [foreword?] (Spivacke's) of the 
check list was generous to us 
both, though I said that he had 
added the fact that the Library
has never paid me a salary
and that you also donated 
your services (or I did for you)
during the early years. Also that 
out first contributions were made
entirely at our own expenses.
In a democracy, however, I have
come to believe that you've got to 
play politics to bet justice [bud?]
I'm damned if I'll do that 
Tell me your plans, Lovingly, Father
