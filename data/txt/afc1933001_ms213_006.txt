Dear Alan: I was sick and 
feeling blue and neglected 
when I wrote my last letter 
to you. You will have to 
live as many years as I have 
seen before you can realize 
just how I feel once in a 
while -- too often, I regret to 
say. I guess I should not feel 
resentful and rebellious at Father 
Time, but so it is. All of which 
means that it is up to you to bear 
with my infirmities with as 
much patience as you can. 
Again I say, for the sake of 
progress and happiness the words
