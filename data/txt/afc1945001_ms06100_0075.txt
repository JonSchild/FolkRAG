6. On Thursday, August 6, a young woman was heard to state that
motorists who really want more gasoline and who "knew the ropes" could
easily obtain it in Columbia. She said an acquaintance of hers had just 
procured a tankful of gasoline without presenting his rationing card and 
that this acquaintance could "do the same thing for other people who
wanted more gasoline." [*South Carolina (Aug 3-8) 16*]
