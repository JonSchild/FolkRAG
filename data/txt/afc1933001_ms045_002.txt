Dear Mr. Lomax,

Macmillan Co. has suggested that I write directly to
you in regard to the use of some American folk songs.

I am interested in developing some ensemble music
for instrumental combinations based on several folksongs
as quoted in your two books.  Ballads and Folksongs and 
Negro Folk Songs as sung by Lead Belly.

I do not intend to use the words but would like to
quote as much as eight measures from each of several tunes.
I can either quote directly or write around the tune and in
its general spirit.

My problem is to determine the extent of the restrictions
involved in the reprint of the tunes in this developed form.
To what extent are these tunes considered public domain under
copyright law.  The following tunes I offer as specific
examples out of which to develop pieces.

Gwine Dig a Hole  p 71  Lead Belly
Blind Lemon  p 164  "  "
Mustang Gray  p 395  Folk Songs and Ballads
Gettin up Holler  p 375  " "

Yours sincerely,
George F. McKay
