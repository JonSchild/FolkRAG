Dear Mr. Spivack: I sent to 
you just a week ago an air
mail request to ship the machine
by Express. No word has since 
come from you. I am in 
urgent need of the machine.
Please let me know if 
there is anything I can do 
to prevent further delay.
I should appreciate an air 
mail reply.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
