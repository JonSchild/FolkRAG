askin anybody, they be glad to git it.  Thass truth.  I'm tellin
you straight. . .An there's another thing bout it.  Anybody that you
love, you're gon beg em to stay wid you.  Thass right.  You be willin
to do anything they want you to do.  Jes fur them to be there.
     (Do you think sometimes people take advantage of that?)
     Yeah, they take advantage of it.  Cause they. . .Now you
