Green Grows the Laurels:
1)  I once had a sweetheart but now I've got none,
He's gone and he's left me to weep and to mourn,
He's gone and he's left me to weep and to mourn,
And we'll change the green laurels to the violets so blue.

Chorus:
Green grows he laurels and sweet falls the dew,
Sorry was I when I parted with you,
But I hope the next meeting I hope you'll prove true,
And we'll change the green laurels to violets so blue.

2)  For he wrote me a letter all rosy and lined,
But I wrote him smother all twiseted and twined,
Saying, keep your love letters and I will keep mine,
For you write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mine.

3)  He passed my window both early and late,
And the looks that he gives me it makes my heart break.
And the looks that he gives me it makes my heart break,
So we'll change the green laurels to violets so blue. (cho.)
