[*I am thinking Mr MacLeish.*]

Dear Alan: I liked the Introduction
very much. Not being certain what
to do with it I sent it on to
Miss Prink saying that for my
part the book was not to be further
held up on this account or any
other. Also I do not know what
you wish me to do with the
enclosed manuscript. I imagine
the Harvard Lampoon publishes only
stuff written by Harvard people.
Why doesn't the lady try the
"NewYorker" I think the last
stanza falls down, though it's
a [slow?] lyric.
