Alan:  This man Wood has been recommended 
for the Distinguished Service Medal for 
some of his [????] exploits where he
was with the U.S. Marines for three
years. When he comes to Washington
to get it he will look you up
Let him talk his ideas.  There may 
be money in him for you
and I know you'll find him 
interesting

Whenever your thought of me 
reaches too low an ebb take 
out my 16th birthday Letter to 
you and re-read it; then, if 
you don't think more kindly 
of me, send it back.
Father
