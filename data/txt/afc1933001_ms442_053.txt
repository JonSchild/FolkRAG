I shall compare these with the other versions.

The remaining melodies will come soon, in the
meanwhile I am hoping to get the texts of You Cain'

before all, that Professor Lomax is well. Tell me if
there is anything I can do in New York at Macmillan's;
I shall be in New York around the middle of May I believe,
if not a little later.

With best wishes,
