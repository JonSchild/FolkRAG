Joke

When Henry Kaiser arrived in Washington he 
was late for an appointment with the newspapermen. 
"What happened?" the reporter asked 
the man who had broken all ships building 
speed records.

"I had to wait thirty minutes for a taxi," explained 
Kaiser.

"Thirty minutes?" a newspaperman asked "Then why 
didn't you build one?"
