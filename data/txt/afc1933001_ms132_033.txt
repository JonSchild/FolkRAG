Dear Mrs. Ward:

The Archive of American Folk-Song and
the Library of Congress wishes to extend
to you and your friends their sincere appreciation
of the contribution you made to the
collection and preservation of old songs. I
am only sorry that I couldn't have stayed
with you longer for I am sure that you would
have been able to recall a great many more
fine old tunes.

I hope that we can keep in touch with
each other so that, as you remember these
songs, you can write them down and send them
into the Library.

Thanking you again, I am,

Sincerely yours,

AL:ed
