1.  I heard once where Hitler made a
long distance call down to hell to the
devil.  He was asking the devil what
must he do because the Allies were
hot on his trail.  After the devil made
two or three suggestions and Hitler said
he had tried them all, the devil told
him to hang up his hat, and come
on down to hell with him.
2.  "All of our colored boys are losing their
lives in this war and fighting for some
thing of which they have no [?]
and when they do something heroes'
they get not credit for it until some
colored paper learns of the incident."
3.  "War is hell, and the quicker all of
us get in there and help to get it
over, the better it will be for all of us."
