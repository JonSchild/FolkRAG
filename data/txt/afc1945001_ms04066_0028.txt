Newark, N. J., August 7, 1942

"Somebody told me the other day that they heard that 5 more saboteurs 
attempted to land in a rubber boat somewhere along the east coast and 
that 3 of them were killed and 2 captured.  The bodies were recovered 
and that the Coast Guard was keeping the other 2 men to find out what 
the Government was going to do about the other 8 that were captured, 
before they made any move to turn them over to the authorities.  If 
the Government did not execute the first ones captured, a fatal accident 
was to occur to the 2 others now being held."
