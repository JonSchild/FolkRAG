   Items that are simply not true are difficult to counteract,
since in their original form they are [*take*] in the range of the
plausible.  They might be true, except that they aren't.  Under
[?*] these circumstances, the only thing that can be truthfully said
is, "this is not so" or some equivalent.  This type of response
is rarely as colorful as the original rumor.  One of the important
factors that bias an individual in the direction of remembering
is the vividness of an experience.  If we pair a vivid rumor with
a relatively dull categorical denial, it seems very unlikely that
the truth will be remembered.  If we are given a series of such
items, the reader will tend to discount the denials.  The constant
presentation of a "No, No, No," pattern leads to a "set" for the
sort of answer to be expected, with a tendency to save one's self
time and to skip the reading of the counteraction.  Since most
reading is of spotty sort, a quick, casual review of material,
rather than a careful analysis of the precise implications of the
content, the reader who recognizes a "this is not so" counteraction,
would be inclined to skip the full statement and go on to the next
juicy tidbit.
   Items that are partially true are difficult to counteract
since the truthful part must be acknowledged.  While the
occasional inclusion of this sort of item lends variety and
greater acceptance of the column as a whole, care is needed.  Any
statement that presents a rumor first and then a counteraction,
saying "it is true - but," loses the effectiveness needed for the
elimination of the rumor.  [Most] Many rumors do have some kernel of
truth but if this becomes emphasized, readers will end up with
