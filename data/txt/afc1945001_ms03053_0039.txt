Utah Salt Lake City (Policeman)
My policeman has failed to put in an appearance as my air-mail
deadline approaches. He is off duty today and I have not been able to
reach him at his home. His rumors will be forwarded as soon as possible.
Should you not receive a supplement to this report within 24 hours,
you will know that he had nothing to report.
