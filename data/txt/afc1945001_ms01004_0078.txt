Race - relations area:  Follow-up intensive study
           of cities where we already have the start
           of sequence   :  original prejudices, forced employment
of Negroes, strike of white workers, forced return 
of strikers.  If possible, paralleled 
by study of cities where there has been: original 
prejudices, forced employment, outstanding harmony.
Perhaps army material might help clear
way for development of pattern for local
informational programs for critical cities.
