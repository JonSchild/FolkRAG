10) "Licht down, licht down now, True Thomas,
And lean your head upon my knee.
Abide and rest a little space
And I will show you fairlie's three."

11) "O see ye no' yon narrow road
So thick beset with thorns and briars?
That is the path of righteousness
Though after it but few enquiores."

12) "And see you no' that braid, braid road
That lies across the lily leven?
That is the path o' wickedness.
Though some call it the road to heaven."

13) "And see ye not that bonny, bonny road
That winds about the fernie brae?
That is the road to air elfland
Where thou and I this nicht maun gae."

14) "But Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue,
Whatever you may hear or see.
For if ye speak word in Elfin-land
Ye'se shall ne'er get back to your sin country."

15) Sine they came to a garden green,
And she pulled an apple frae a tree.
"Tak' this for thy wages, True Thomas,
It will give the tongue that can never lie."

16) "My tongue is my sin," True Thomas said,
"A goodly gift ye would gie to me.
I neither dought to buy or sell
At fair or tryst where I may be."

17) I dought neither speak to prince or peer,
Nor ask of grace from fair lady.
"Now hold they peace," the lady said,
For as I say so it must be."

18) He has gotten a coat of the even cloth,
And a pair of shoes o' velvet green.
And till seven years were gaen and past
True Thomas on earth was never seen.
