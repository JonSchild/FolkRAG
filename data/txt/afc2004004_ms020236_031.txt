BJ:        Oh, they'd talk, different talk.   Had lots of fun, but 
they certainly didn' tell me any business [about any one of 'um] what was goin' on.  
You'd hear about different things, anyhow.   Jus' tell 
you different things, what they'd done.   [They] I didn' have 
time to talk about it nohow.   But anyway, they didn't have 
no, no kind of private talk, to me.
TL:        Were they real rough guys?
BJ:        No. . .They weren't so rough.   I didn't fool with those 
rough ones.
TL:        No, I mean, strong. . .
BJ:        Oh, yeah, they [was] strong.   You [would] know they have to 
be strong to hold that kind of work.  Much strong an' jolly 
an' friendly all the time, most of 'em, around me.   'Cause if I 
started cookin' for -- any man, don't care who he is -- if he's 
got to come in the house an' act [jus' awful] disorderly, if I see it look 
like he['s not] ain' goin' be very nice -- you know what I mean, jus' 
come in cussin' an [suroblobbin'] hoblobbyin' an' actin' [like a] crazy, I 
don' fool aroun.'   [But] I jus' don't cook for 'im.  Don't go 
out with 'im.    [Yessuh.] Pass 'em up.  Somebody else I cook for, he could 
cook for hisself; many mens cook for [him]theyself, you know, 'cause 
[they --] if they doin' it too good they (pay 'em) about it.   But 
a lot of 'em will like to have their meals, then they res', so 
they can go where they wanna go, [on the] other plantations.

[*BJ'S ONLY LIGHT SKINNED LOVER.  (17?)*]           
An' a guy that I used to go with in the country with, up 
there -- not that same place, but another place, up there -- 
from ov' the field on down to Millon -- but, anyway, this guy 
that I was [tellin' you about, was] takin' up with after I [was with] quit Cassius, 
ya know?   He was the on'y -- I think I tol' you that story -- 
he's the on'y light skinned guy I had, an' the las' one an'
I hope he'll always be the las' one.
TL:        Oh yeah!
BJ:        Uh-huh.
TL:        What was wrong with him?
BJ:        I jus' didn' like him.  You know what I mean, I jus' 
didn'. . .
TL:        But you didn't know right away, though?
BJ:        Ah, no.   I'm talkin' about this. . .[See] Yeah, I liketed him 
jus' fine, in a way of speakin', but I jus' don' like the 
way that -- they are.   An' I found that, to my idea now --
