a member of one of the royal families of the
blues, Sam Chapman.   [SWITCHES TO PAUSE] 
The Chapman family was here when the blues
began, almost a hundred years ago.  They 
helped to make them and popularise them, and
when you think about it, it was almost a
miracle that occurred then, deep in the
heart of the delta. [*]*]  A kind of song was born,
ah, a new kind of song that ah has si - since
then uncoiled in the era of the whole world. 
I mean the blues is maybe the only international 
song form that we've ever had, and
ah the reasons for it are, aremysterious, and
Sam's gonna tell us about some of those.
