ANCELET  Well you know. . .
LOMAX  Get your shell fish. I went back
to this part of France myself here, I went to this part of
France and I, I was amazed that the first thing that
happened to me was they gave me a huge dish of shell fish.
ANCELET  Yeah, well in, in, when we were in
La Rochelle we ate, we ate crabs and shrimp and, and seafood
the whole time, which made us feel very at home.  And when
we went out to the countryside to visit it struck me that it
was flat as a card table, exactly like here.  And it's what
they call [les land] in France, you know the [acquatane]
and, and north of it.  And it's perfectly flat, marshy along
the coast, just like here.  [STATIC-MIKE OFF]
[WILD SOUND] [DIRECTIONS]
LOMAX  A musical tradition turns out to
be a way that a people have of communicating all that they
are, the, the minimum of establishing the border of their
culture and making it possible for everyone within the sound
of that magical song or [UNCLEAR] to identify with each
other culturally speaking.  That's the function, first
function of music.  And we've been continually surprised in
studying the history of new world music to discover that
people brought this invisible rhythmic bubble with them
wherever they, they went.  The British settled in the 
mountains and they kept their fiddles and their ballads.
