Dear Dr. Lomax:

                Yours of the 2nd from Austin.
                A check from the Carnegie Corporation for the $3,000 has
just been received.  I am, therefore, authorizing the Disbursing
Officer to forward to you a remittance of $750 in anticipation of
the outlay for the first quarter.
               As to the frank:  It would be quite suitable in any communication
to us here, but might be questioned if used by you in
the field to other correspondents in the field.  Any such question had better be avoided, even to the disadvantage of the fund.
                As you may have occasion not merely to write to us but to
forward some batches of material, I am enclosing twenty penalty labels
which will bring them clear of postage.  They have merely to 
be pasted on to any envelope of package.

                                                                      Very sincerely yours,
                                                                                                           Librarian
