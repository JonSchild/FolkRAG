CARLSON'S RAIDERS (cont)
-2-

They whisper of Raiders who gamble with death
And fought like the demons of old
And those who were there are willing to swear
By Carlson's Raiders so bold.

They will sing of the sailor and soldier I know
And tell of the deeds that were done
But Carlson's Raiders will sing for themselves
And tell how the battle was won.

So here's to the Raider who stands by his flag
Who offers his life for his land
Who marches to fame with pride in the name
Of Carlson's Raider Band.
