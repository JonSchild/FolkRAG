There was a buck private who always
had a tough top sergeant in every
company he was in. One day he was
transferred to another company. A big,
tough, top sergeant walked up and said,
"Hey! Bud!". The little buck private
trembled nervously. Then the sergeant
said, "Can I do anything to help you?"
The buck private fainted.
