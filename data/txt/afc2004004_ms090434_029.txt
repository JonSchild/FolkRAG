Marie Ivy Burkes was called to
Clayton Sunday where funeral
services were held for the late
Jennie B. Hudson of Tunican.
Julius Marie Herron of Rust
College spent Wednesday afternoon
at home with her grandmother,
Minnie Wirner. She returned
to Rust College Thursday
morning.

[?] Harriet—
I'm sure of it. It isn't right for him
to marry her. Tell him, Virginia!"
She shook her head. "No—I could
not do that to Harriet. You're only
being selfish. You want Harriet
yourself but, you see, she loves
John. . . ."
BY THE following morning, John
was feeling considerably better.
In fact, he even demanded to be
allowed out of bed, but the middle-aged
nurse who had been engaged
to attend him firmly told him that
she would listen to no such nonsense
as that.
Toward noon, Bert brought him
the news that Monteros had been
caught. Following the report Bert
had given the police shortly after
the shooting, they had sent out an
alarm. Within twelve hours, Monteros
had been apprehended as he
was about to board a plane for
Mexico. The diamonds had been
found in the lining of his suitcase.
During the next few days, John
could not complain of being lonely,
for both Harriet and Bert spent
much time with him. However, he
chafed under his enforced inactivity.
He received a note and some
flowers from Virginia, but she did
not come to see him. Her avoidance
of him was a disappointment. He
supposed it was best that she didn't
come, in view of Harriet's attitude.
Still, considering how much Virginia
had been involved in what
had happened, he would have expected
her to pay him at least one
visit. That she didn't, hurt deeply.
On the third day after his mishap,
he was sitting up for the first
time, when the nurse came in to
announce Margaret Bailey. John
was pleased — wondered whether
Virginia had sent her.
Mrs. Bailey greeted him with
motherly concern, then sat down to
chat cheerfully of this and that. As
she rambled on, he began to think
she wasn't even going to mention
Virginia.
Finally, however, she said, "Virginia
is very much upset. John—
blames herself for what happened."
"She shouldn't. It wasn't her
fault."
"I suppose you know why she
hasn't come to see you?"
John smiled wryly. "Because of
Harriet, I guess. Harriet, I'm afraid,
is inclined to be jealous, and hasn't
hesitated to tell Virginia how she 
feels. It's very foolish of her, of
course."
Mrs. Bailey looked at him
shrewdly. "Is it so foolish? Maybe
she has good reason to be jealous.
I happen to know, John, that you
were in love with Virginia once—
that you proposed to her in San
Juan."
He lowered his eyes, didn't answer.
Abruptly, Mrs. Bailey rose. "Well,
I must be going. Virginia and I are
leaving for California this evening
with her father, and I have a lot to
do."
John looked up quickly. "Leaving
for California?"
"Yes." Mrs. Bailey moved toward
the door, then turned. "Would you
like to know why she is going,
John? It's because of you. She's
running away because she's afraid

Well, at least she w
real self-sacrifice, doing
unselfish thing, for the first
her life -- if there were any cons
tion in that.  She felt sure that, if
she chose to do so, she could take
John away from Harriet, but she
had made her decision and she
meant to stick to it.
Sighing, she glanced at her
watch.  What was keeping Margaret
Bailey?  The older woman had gone
on a last-minute errand but, if she
didn't return soon, they would miss
their train.
Just then, Virginia heard the
front doorbell ring.  That must be
Margaret now.  She rose and went
out into the upper hall -- heard the
maid admitting some one.
She started down the stairs, then
stopped short.  John stood in the
hall below!
He glanced up and saw her, but
he didn't speak -- just stood there
looking at her.  One of his arms was
in a sling, and his uplifted face was
pale and drawn.
"John!" Virginia hurried down
to him.  "Should you be out like
this?"
"It's all right.  I heard you were
going to California and wanted to
see you before you left."
As she led him into the living
room and sat down beside him
on the sofa, she was torn between
conflicting emotions.  She was glad
he had come -- but sorry, too.  Oh, he
shouldn't have come!  He was only
making things harder for her!
He caught hold of her hand and
said earnestly, "Virginia -- don't
go."
Her eyes widened.  "Why not?"
"Because I don't want you to do."
Words came tumbling from his lips.
"Virginia, six years ago, when I was
Johnny the gas-station man.  I
asked you for a date and you
laughed at me.  In San Juan, I asked
you to marry me -- and you laughed
at me again.  Maybe I'm a fool to try
my luck once more, but maybe
there's a charm in the third time.
Virginia, I still love you -- can never
love any one else.  Will you marry
me?"
For an instant, she was speechless.
Then, she stammered, "But -- but
what about Harriet?"
"That's all over.  She came to me
this afternoon and released me -- of
her own accord.  Said she knew I
didn't love her and had decided it
would only bring both of us unhappiness
if she tried to hold onto
me.  It was fine of her.  I think, too,
that Bert Mason had something to
do with it -- had been talking to her."
"Yes," Virginia murmured.  "Bert
loves her.  I hope he and she --"
I do, too,"  John said fervently.
"Bert's a fine fellow.  But Virginia,
you -- you haven't given me my answer."
She looked at him, her eyes
misty.  "Your answer?  Darling, kiss
me...."
There was no laughter now.  As
he held her close with his one good
arm and pressed his lips against
hers, she felt more like crying --
crying for joy.
