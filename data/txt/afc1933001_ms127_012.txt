Moreover during the last two months I was not even on the Washington payroll
but have been paid from the regional office in Milwaukee, so there is certainly
no impropriety in my assuming I am free to have a mind of my own. I
feel this the more clearly as the recording I have done, while applauded by
C.S. beforehand in principle, was never supported by his backing and assistance
when it came to the point. He avoided even discussing the plan for my
first trip and tried to stop it the day I was to leave. When I went out to
Region II he informed me that it was too bad that, since I was no longer working
for the Music Unit, I could n't do any more recording. Fortunately, in
both instances, Mr. Dornbush and Mr. Van Hyning had a different idea; and I
understand Charlie well enough --- he and Ruth were so anxious to do it them selves,
(and no one could blame them,)-- and it is almost impossible for his
temperament to commit itself to action in the face of any reluctance. I am
endlessly in his debt in all sorts of ways, for I learned much from him, and
continue to do so, and am besides very fond of all the Seegers,
As long as I was in the office I was his assistant, and no two
ways about it. But in the field I was turned loose almost entirely on my own, because
there were more considerations than musical ones involved in the recording; and
his recent assumption that I have been "ghosting" for him is quite a mistaken
one. It is of course indiscreet of me to write all this, but I feel I have
committed sins enough in submitting the enclosed memorandum without being suspected
of grave disloyalty in the bargain.

I thought of telegraphing you, or even telephoning you; but dispaired of making
myself understood by wire, and am too poor to telephone Washington lightly. Besides, 
except that I hated being so at sea with respect to actual figures, it
seemed to me there were some advantages in your being able to say that you knew
nothing of the matter beforehand. Moreover, the time was so extremely short,
it seemed to me I would have to devote it to thinking the thing through in my
own way, for what that was worth, as otherwise the whole thing might blow up
in complete confusion. The result is n't conspicuous for its clarity even so,
for the time was so very short, but I hope it is interesting, if you survive
the first 2 or 3 pages.

Originally, instead of discussing any sums of money, I referred the matter to
the Librarian and yourself; but I was advised not to do that, but to risk an
estimate, no matter how tentative. I suspect my figures are a little high;
but if so, and any real interest is shown, that will put you in the pleasant position
of being able to reduce them, which is all to the good. I was also advised
against requesting a small fund to tackle my own interests alone, and this seemed
to me to be excellent advice since that is just what everybody else has been
doing, and since I emphatically believe that is the wrong way to go about it
anyway. Moreover, in order to justify a small request I was going to have to
present just as complete a picture as to justify a larger, more general project
and, thinks I, one might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I wished I could
have asked Dr. Wilbur for more detailed advice; but that did n't seem possible 
somehow. I did n't know whether $50,000 is going to seem so high as to be
ridiculous in proportion to other requests; but all I could do was present my
reasoning, which I still think is good. Also I forced myself to cut out all
the qualifications of statement, and alternative suggestions, which I felt
only confuse the picture, and which could always be presented by the Library if
matters ever get so far. For example, certain states have already had so much
attention that the time allotted them might well be diverted to other rich
but unexplored fields. I tried to avoid the various disputes about terminology,
with very indifferent success; but I had to remember that a possible reader,
while likely to be a man of great cultivation and, passively at least, a musician
he would n't give a damn about all the qualifications of statement
I wanted frequently to make in the interests of strictest accuracy. I had time
to try the original draft out on only one person, who luckily is a person who
