Fisk, 10.  4.
three-thrity.   The queen was unconscious.   He fucked [her] until four, and 
the guards began to get uneasy, and they decided [to go down and see] bust the door down 
what was the trouble.   And the men was sitting up on the side of the 
bed jacking [off his teeth pointed on] in a teaspoon, pouring it in her.

It was on the fifth of May
When the great Titanic went down.
Po [Paul] [s]hine was on the bottom of the deck.
[The Captain] [Him] and his mate was havin a little chat.
Po’ [Paul] Shine ran up to the top of the deck,
Say, "Captain, captain, the water is now
Coming in the boiler room door."
He say, "Go back, Paul [Po’] Shine, and pump the water [back] bight;
We got one hundred and fifty [two] pumps to keep the water back."
Paul [Po’] Shine [backed] dashed his black ass [off the boat] overboard
And bega[i]n to swim.
The captain, say, "Come back, [Paul] Po' Shine, save po' me
[Come] to me.
I'll make you just as rich
As any [son of a bitch] man can be.”
Po' [Paul] Shine looked back
Over his shoulder and said,
"What good is money to me 
in the middle of the sea?"
Went right ahead, Just then
A millionaire girl
Walked him [from] the bottom of the deck.
She say, "Come back, Paul [Po] Shine,
And save poor me.
I [can] [*might turn*] be your wife;
It's [ture?] me"
He looked back 
Over his shoulder and said,
["For me you're pudding]  Honey, you're purty lookin jelly roll, it's true,
[And jelly roll, it's true.”]
He said, "There are a thousand 
in New York good as you."
He swim right ahead.   
Just then a whale[, he jumped up and grinned]
[Jumped up the sea.]
Paul Shine looked back 
Over his shoulder again [at him--]
Jumped up and walked the water 
like Christ did in Galilee.
When the Titanic went down, 
Po’ [Paul] Shine was down in [Holland] Harlem
Almost damn drunk.  
The Devil was [y]laying across his bed. 
He got up and walked to the door 
and [walked] looked out [and said] and he said,
"They [were a] been long time coming, 
But they welcome to Hell."
