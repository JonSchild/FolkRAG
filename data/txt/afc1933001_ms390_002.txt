[*Ben Small*]

Ben's sister (Missy) knocking on 
the box just as it went down:
Ben, son, come back en tell
me: Come back, Ben, en tell
sister! Member now, I'll
be waitin'! Come back, Ben,
an' tell sister what you
didn't finish!"

Ben had tried to whisper his
last words to Missy.

In the song: 
Ben, aint you gwine tell,
'em how dey pros-see-
cut yuh?
Ben, ain yuh gwine tell
'em how dey lie upon yuh?"
