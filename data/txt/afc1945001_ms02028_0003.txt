These rumors were quoted from remarks by certain 
army officers. I don't know, of course, whether the officers ever made these statements. I heard this both in Des Moines and Ames and from persons who were in Ames temporarily but 
lived in other sections of the country.

(5) The navy. "At Dutch Harbor a navy vessel found its 
anti-aircraft ammunition locked up and inaccessible until the 
captain of the ship could be wakened." I heard this in Ames as a story told by a sailor on a destroyer at Dutch Harbor. I heard it only once and the story bears the marks of pure invention.

Many rumors as to the unpreparedness of the navy at Pearl Harbor continue to be heard but these are all repetitions of earlier reports with which you are probably familiar.

By far the greatest amount of talk centered on the ineffectiveness 
of the Administration's efforts to win the war.
