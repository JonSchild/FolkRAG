WB 1/4
Daddy had got him some cows and different things.  They had a camp, a
government camp and we traded milk to the camp.  Traded it for coffee,
sugar, meat, lard, and flour, dried peaches, dried apples - things like
that.  We had a little side room built on the side of the house.  Daddy
called that the store room.  and we would [t]store the stuff up in there and 
there was people up there that didn't have any bread and didn't hav e any
coffee [and] or nothing.  They'd just line up at my daddy's house to drink
coffee.
     So my mother told my daddy, she said, "Tom what you should do, you
should give these people some coffee instead of all of them coming in here.
You started making coffee so you need to get you a great big old coffee
pot like they use in the government camp.. If you gonna give them coffee,
let them drink coffee here.  So why do you just give it to them."
     Dad[a] always agreed with my mother on things [she was saying] that he
thought she was saying was right.  Now he had some big old tall, blue
containers.  I can't remember whether they was 25 pound cans or 50 pound
cans but they was getting whole cans full.
     I had four goats.  I had a Sears and Roebuck wagon and my goats--
they had more sense than I did.  That's what I'd take the milk to camp
with and that's what I'd bring back the trade that I could get, in my
goat wagon.  They had started putting shoes on horses and mules and I wanted
some shoes for my goats and I got me some paper tacks and cut me some
------ hammer ____________ to go put some shoes on my goats.  I drove some
paper tacks up in my goats' hooves and made the _______________.  I got up there the
next morning and all my goats couldn't hardly walk across.  So Daddy
said, "Boy."  I said, "Yes sir."  I thought he was going to whup me, you
know.
