3) O lassie, o lassie, ye are too young,
Ye hae na the nack o' the beggin' tongue,
Ye hae na the nack o' the beggin' tongue
And wi' me ye canna gang.

4) I'll bend my back and bow my knee,
And put a black patch on my knee,
And for a beggar they'll take me,
And awa' wi' you I'll gang.

5) Early next morning the old wife awoke,
AND AT HER LEISURE SHE PUT ON HER CLOTHes,
Straight to the servant bid she goes
To speer for the silly auld man.

6) She gaed to the bed where the beggar lay,
The stray was calling - he was away,
She clabbered her hands, cried well-a-day,
Is all our good gear gang?

7) The servant gaed where the daughter lay,
She sheets were cold and she was away,
And fast to the goodwife she did say
"She's awa' with the beggarman."

8) Some rode on horseback and some rode on foot,
All but the auld wife, she wasna fit,
She hobbled abot frae hip to hip,
And aye she cursed and bant.

9) When years had passed some two or three,
This same beggar carl came owre yon lea,
Saying, "Good wife, for your good ee
Will ye lodge a silly-peer man?

10) A beggar, a beggar I'll never lodge again,
I had a daughter but een o' my ain,
And awa' wi' a beggarman she's gane,
And I dinna ken whence nor whaur.

11) O auld wife, o auld wife, what would ye gie,
For a sight o' your daugther Jean to see,
A bairn on her back and anither on her knee,
And anither on the road coming hame.
Lomax: And what's the story on that?
Strachan: Well, it was just supposed to be James VIth.
Lomax: Really! Wel, what was he doing out on the road?
Strachan: Well, he used to go out, you see, to find out what his
subjects were like, and that's supposed tob be him. He was one
of those kings who liked to find out what folks were doing and 
how they were behaving.
