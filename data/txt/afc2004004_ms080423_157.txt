. . .           the boy, they don't have to run from 'em now.  If anything,
the boys is arunnin'
SH:  One time there was a boy after a girl arunnin' and she wore
about five slips back . . .               make her look big, and one slip
was comin' loose and it come down around her legs, she kicked it
off and went . . .                          He never caught her, she's quick
enough she left her slip alayin'. . .                            He come over, picked
it up, went and took it over, took it over to her home and give it
to her.
AL:  Ray, did you ever have any trouble with the women that
way? 
RH:  Oh, well, uh, yeah, some, but, uh, but most of mine just
acourtin' what done that is how they felt with the boy.  If they
felt with 'im purty good, now they wasn't quite as hard to run
down.  But, but now, if the, but now if you was wanted to, if they, if the
parents hadn't spoke up that they wanted to marry that, if you
wasn't you'd be clawed all to pieces, like Stanley say.  But now
if the parents was afeelin' for the young man to  take the daughter,
they tamed them purty fast, is the way it was, now.  If they talked,
if they spoke agin the boy, he just  . . .       quit.  He needn't(?)
arun them or what, he'll never get to marry 'em.  The parents kinda
come in then to get 'em married, who they wanted to take the girl.
And directly(?) then on up in my time and before some there, or iin
my oldest brother's time when he married, they got the collar(?)
come in and they got to stealin' the girl, get a good hand of hair(?)
through the collar, and they'd go slippery and get to the preacher's
and get married, and, gosh, there'd be a war for a while. . .
