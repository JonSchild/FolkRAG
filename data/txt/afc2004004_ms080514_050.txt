came to life in its early days, and this was

way that ah the first blues that ever came into
my family was sung.  Ah - [SINGS] - 

[*04 . 17 . 04 . 14*]     In 1905, when that song was sung to my
mother and father in a recording trip in

to my parents that she wouldn't sing it for
my father, and it had to be a solo performance
for my mother in a closed - with the door
closed.  The blues were like that at the
beginning.  And we have to remember that it
was through the blues that - and through
