what suits a woman.  He don't nevah do a devilish thang but lay
around.  He don't nevah work hard ner nothin.  You understand me?
But a man thass a hard workin man, it doesn't take much to kill im,
cause he's mighty nigh daid anyhow when he git through work.
But a sorry man ain't doin nothin but jes layin round on his h unkers
an dressin up every day.
(Hi s hunkers?)
You know what that is.  Thass what God made him to set on.
He ain't doin anythin but settin up theah dressed up.  He gon feel
like doin anythang a woman asks him to.  You understand?  Whatever
she asks him.  Thass truth!  Now ain't I right?  He gon be full of
everythang.  You understand?
(People shouldn't have to work so hard.)
Well, maybe you don't thank so.  But heah's one thang
about it.  Ain't nobody gon give you nothin.  Ain't nobody gon give
you nothin atall.  If you git anything at all you gon git out,
stretch down an brown-skin fur it.  I'm gon tell you straight, thass
what you gon do.  You don't know how to take keer of anything that
come to you easy.  But when you had to work fo it, you know how you
come by it, an you'll take keer of it bettah.
(Do I understand you to say, Rev. Davis, that when a
man has had to work as hard as many men do, he just
can't make love as they might?)
No, not as they wish.  They're jes not able.  Too worn
out.  You ought to know that.  If you have to work every day, an come
in, you don't want no man pawin ovah you, don't keer how well you
love him.  It's truf.  You might want to satisfy im, but you naturally
don't feel like bein bothahed.  The body's tihad an broke down.
Truf.
