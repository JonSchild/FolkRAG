Dear Dr. Lomax: -

I thank you for your letter of July 9th,
I am glad that my plan interested you. I am continuing
my work, in so far as it is possible, around New York. Soon
we will begin to record the folksongs of Czechoslovaks
with Dr. Herzog, in the music laboratory. I have not yet
received an answer from Dr. Seeger, but it is unnecessary
to tell you that I am still as interested in my work as I
was when I spoke with you.

I am enclosing the article about Children's
games, which I promised to do for Mrs. Seeger, and as I do not
know her address, would you be kind enough to give it to her?

Sincerely yours,
Svatava Jakobson
