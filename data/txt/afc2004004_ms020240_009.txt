BJ TAPE 26, P. 7

You know when they crucified Jesus, if he'd a-wanted to, He
could destroy the world?  Ya see when Peter come up there an', an'
joint (?) that sword an cut off the the high priest's ear? [Then, an'] an' everything?
He told Peter to put it up.  See?  Don't fight with them
swords, see?  Then He said, "If I want his ear, I could just ask
my Father."  Heh, heh!  "An He give me legions of angels," ya see?
An' so he --  But why He did that, He had love.  An he had the
weight of sin on 'Is shoulders, the whole world.  Ya see? And then
he know what to do.  An' God, Himself, ya see?, is just made up
[*(GOD'S LOVE)*]
of nothin' but love, just 'boundin' with love.  He, He coulda just
made nothin' but angels.  Nothin' but angels.  An' had His Heaven
by Himself, Him an' His angels, ya see?  An' he was able to make
'em an' they didn' have to be bo'n, through no fear, for nothin'.
But He loved the peoples.  
     Now, this bo'nin' (borning) through fear,
an' sinful flesh, hit give peoples a joy, that knowin' the world.
Because they enjoy gettin' the chilren.  It's ...an' then enjoy
the chirrun.  They enjoy the way they get 'em sometime, ya see?
An' that's they function of they body, [that] the Christlike spirit an'
the Christlike feelin', ya know.  It's God's spirit, ya see?
     An' then, He gives us so much the, to understand that we should love.
He said, "Love one another as I have loveded you.  An' He give His life for
us.  An' God give his Son for us.  He made His Son, out of 
the words.  Took [t]his [woman] word an' made a son.  That's pure love, nothin'
but.love.  Lov[in']ed ya befo' He ever made ya.  An' lov[in']ed ya before
He put ya in the world.  Then He fix fruit for ya to eat an' He fix
animals.  He fix it so you could just go out an' kill 'em an'
eat 'em.  Now, that's sumpin' -- take that live.  Life had to be
taken all the way through.  All the way down.  'Till Jesus' life to save us
[was savin'] from our sins, an' takes [sins out] things' life to save our body.  Ya see?
