The Life of A Soldier
Pvt. Jones had a hard time in the Army form the very first day. His first misfortune was getting in the wrong tent, he entered and unpacked his belongs. It was late so he decided to go to bed. He undressed got in bed. Suddenly a loud voice called. What are you doing in my tent? I am the Sergeant. "Well I'm sorry sergeant, but this is my tent" it is not, it is. They went on arguing Pvt. Jone ended up in the guard house. The next day he got into more trouble. First he was late to breakfast. It was all gone. I'll look over that and eat twice as much dinner. He had to clean the Sergeant's cars. When he finished the work, it was dinner time. He was new so he didn't get much dinner. That evening he went into town. He was supposed to be back at 6:30. All went well until about five oclock. He met a pretty girl.
