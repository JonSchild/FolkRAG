"I don't believe there is any rubber shortage. I saw the other day where
tire dealers said they had enough tires for two years. I know several
dealers myself who have thousands of tires and tubes that are frozen.
They can't sell them and they can't get their money back. The government
just makes them keep the tires on their shelves and they rot."
(Contractor, Tuscaloosa, Alabama August 5, 1942.) [*1*]
