My dear Mr. Lomax:

May I ask your help in identifying
and filling out a couple of cowboy songs which I
cannot find in any collection?

I heard the songs from Mr. E.C. Abbott
("Teddy Blue"), of Gilt Edge, Montana an old man
who came up the trail from Texas in 1883, and has
lived in Montana ever since. I am collaborating
with him in writing his reminiscences-- considerably
handicapped by the fact that I live in New York.
But I expect to get back to Montana and finish the
book early this summer.

About the songs, first, there is the one
he spoke of as "that Ogallally song." I could get
it only in fragments. It was a song of rivers-
a verse for every river on the Texas trail, "from
the Nueces to the Yellowstone." It was a night song-
because he spoke of one man singing a verse as he
circled around the herd, and his partner answering
with another verse- a very beautiful and haunting
minor chant, with couplets which rhymed only when
convenient, and a wordless refrain of "Oh-o-o-o-oh!"
He didn't remember the verses very well, but said:
"There was one about We crossed Red River when she
was up in the willows-- We crossed the Platte
when she was a mile from bank to bank- and so on."

Also this one: "We went down Punkin Creek to
old Tongue River
And down the flat to old
Miles City on the Yellowstone"

Pure geography, in other words. If any
of this connects with anything you have ever heard,
-or even if you know of a chant with that
"Oh-o-o-o-oh!" I should  be very grateful for information,
as it is a beautiful song and I'd like to put
it in the book, music and all.
