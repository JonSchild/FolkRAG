Subject:      Letter from Kenneth M. Gould, Editor-in-Chief, SCHOLASTIC


            The attached letter asks whether we are engaged in
establishing a "rumor clinic" and offers to print something
about it.

            In a recent conversation with Chester S. Williams of
the Office of Education, I learned that that organization is
sponsoring rumor clinics all over the country. Williams
stated that these had the approval of OFF and, I believe,
mentioned you specifically as approving them. In the course
of the discussion he explained that college professors in
some 40 centers throughout the country will be encouraged to
speak publicly about rumors which they hear, interpreting
them, dissecting them, and in general trying to run counter
propaganda. Upon cross-questioning he admitted and subsequently
indicated to Schramm in a separate conversation that most of
the work which these professors are to do will be "on their
own", in other words not in conformity with policy statements
received from the Government. As you know, if you approved the
plan, OFF will control statements of policy issued to these
rumor clinics with respect to rumors which are analyzed by
the Coordinator of Information and our Bureau of Intelligence.

           The point is that whereas the scheme on its face looks
as though it is under control, Williams actually indicates
that most of what the volunteer rumor analysts will do will
be entirely without control or direction.

            I think this is very dangerous and if OFF approval
has been given without knowledge of this aspect of the program,
I think we should reconsider.

                                                                [*RH*]

                                                                   Robert Huse
