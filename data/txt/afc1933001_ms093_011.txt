April 15, 1942

My dear Mr. Lomax,
   Thank you for your favor of April the eighth.  I have already heard from
your father and everything has been cleared up.  As I wrote him, there is much
argument about these copyrights, and when the case assumes a legal aspect I begin
to feel uneasy.  He has been wonderfully co-operative, however, and I think the
matter is satisfactorily adjusted.
   I do not think I took the opportunity in my previous letter to express to
you how much I enjoyed your contribution to the program in Milwaukee.

Very sincerely yours,
Helen S. Leavitt
