Language Committee is concerned, in its infancy and much will depend
upon the direction given our plans during the next six months.  Any
time you have an idea or suggestion, please shoot it in as promptly
as you can.

I had heard of your work with the Portable Electric 
Recording apparatus and am delighted that you will be in South Carolina
some time this winter. I shall look forward with pleasure to seeing
you and shall do all that I can to help with your plans.  Let me
know as soon as you can when you expect to come to this state. 
      
Please tell me how to approach the Council of
Learned Societies best; that is, to whom to write to and what existing 
work of theirs to suggest alliance with. I believe your suggestion 
on this point is excellent.
  
 I have alread ordered your new book and am looking
forward with great interest to seeing it.

I hear from Tom Peete occasionally and from the 
tone of his letters, he seems much more encouraged and optimistic
that he was several years ago. I hope he is getting entirely and 
permanently all right.

With best wishes, I am

Yours cordially,
Reed Smith
