Dear Mr. Spinacke: You
wont rejoice to get the
two enclosures, but they belong
to you and I have no
choice except to send them
on.

This year rains have come
to Texas and the state is
ablaze with flames. Also
I am picking blackberries for breakfast
from my back yard while
the mocking birds make[s] music.
Why should I hunger for the
traffic and clamor of cities?

Your friend, John A. Lomax
