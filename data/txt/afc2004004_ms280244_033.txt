For in hunting them down, I had my full share
No keepers who knew me approached with with deer.

Alone in the mountain alone in the hill,
Along through the valley he poached at his will,
He thought not of joys but a wild savage pride
The prey of his gun and his dog by his side.
etc.

"There was a weaver of the North
And O but he was cruel,
The very first night that he got wed
He sat and grat for gruel.

He widna want his gruel,
He widna want his gruel,
The very fist night that he got wed,
He sat and grat for gruel.

"There is nae a pot in a' the hoose,
That I can make ye gruel."
"O the washing pot, it will di with me
For I main hae my gruel.

For I main hae my gruel,
I canna want my gruel
Oh the washing pot it will dee with me
For I main hae my gruel."

"There is nae a spoon in a' the hoose
That ye can sup your gruel,"
"O, the garden spade it will de wi' me
For I maen hae ma gruel

For I main hae my gruel,
I canna went my gruel
Oh the garden spade it will de wit' me
For I maen hae ma gruel.

She get baen the house for cakes and wine
She brought them on a toll,
"O, ge'wa, ge'wa with your falderals,
For I maen hae ma gruel.

For I main hae my gruel,
I canna went my gruel,
O, ge'wa, ge'wa with your falderals,
For I maen hae my gruel."

Come all young lassies take my advice,
