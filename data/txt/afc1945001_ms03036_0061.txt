Subject: War Rumors

In compliance with instructions received from Mr. Fred M. Wilcox,
Regional Director, Federal Security Agency, Minneapolis, Minnesota,
I herewith submit war rumors which I have heard during the week ending
August 8, 1942.

Fargo, North Dakota, August 4.--"Sugar rationing is not really
necessary. They (in Washington) printed a million ration cards and [*3*]
by the time they were ready there was no sugar shortage, but to save
their faces after spending all that money, they had to carry on
rationing for a while even though the need had passed."

Ely, Minnesota, August 8.--"There's nothing fair about the [*1?*]
draft. I know one case in our town where they are leaving boys at
home in jobs that weren't necessary--where there was money in the
family, and took boys from homes where they're really needed on farms.
Took one mother's only son and only means of support."

Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 6.--"A person can't make a
living. Ceilings on all the things we can get. But the farmers have
no ceilings on their foods. They charge whatever they want. The
government pays so high a price for butter, we can't buy it so we can
sell it. They're just trying to crowd us out."
