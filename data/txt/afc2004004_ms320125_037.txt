there's two things in life he wants to do.  He wants to play
the accordian like the late Nathan [Utshar] and he wants to
sing like my late, my late brother, Rodney.  And if he's
done that he's accomplished everything he wanted.  Not
everything, but 90% of his life.  He's a very devoted young
man to, to music, to the culture.  He's one of the few that
has my, my way of thinking of music.  And I'm proud of him,
man, I love to play with him.  And I keep telling him,
Robert, somebody is going to have to step in my shoes or the
old timer's shoes when, when we go.  And, and you can do it.

a very good spokesman if you let him.  I'm just proud of
him.
