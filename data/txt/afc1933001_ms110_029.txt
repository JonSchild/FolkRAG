The Cherry Tree Carol

1.  Joseph was an old man,
An old man was he,
He married Virgin Mary,
The Queen of Galilee.

2.  Joseph and Mary walked
Deep in a wood
Where they spied cherries
As red as any blood.

3. Up spoke Virgin Mary,
So meek and so mild,
"Go gather me cherries,
For I am with child."

4. Joseph flew in angry,
In angry flew he,
"Let the father of your baby
Gather cherries for thee."

5. Up spoke little Jesus,
So clear and so sweet:
"Bow down, little cherries,
My mother would eat."

6. Then the cherry tree bowed down
Low down to the ground;
And Mary gathered cherries
While Joseph stood around.

7. Then Joseph took Mary
All on his right knee,
"O tell me, sweet baby,
When your birthday shall be?"

8. "On the 12th day of January
My birthday shall be
When the elements shall tremble
And the stars dance with glee."
