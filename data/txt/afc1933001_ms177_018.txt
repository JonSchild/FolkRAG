MEMORANDUM

FROM
Archive of American Folk-Song Division

TO THE CHIEF OF THE
Music Division
December 12, 1941

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

    The opportunity was presented to me in New York to obtain a good copy of an old Victor recording, out of print and unobtainable, which we do not have in our record collection, containing two mountain ballads with authentic banjo accompaniment. This is possibly the most authentic commercial record of American folk song that has been made, to my knowledge. I wish to recommend that we furnish the donor, Woodie Guthrie, with an acetate duplicate of this recording in return for his generous gift to the Library of Congress folk song collection. The cost will be $2.00.

Respectfully yours, 

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
