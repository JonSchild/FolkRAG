Ballad - F. B. I.
Bob was assigned by the F.B.I.
to investigate the fires
which occurred each day in the same old way
Bringing down the morale of the fliers.
So Bob got a job in the factory
To ferret out the spies
He met the bosses daughter and Wow!
The air was full of sighs

The fires occurred on sunny days
And in the same location
One day Bob stood upon the spot
And found out some information

The seat of his pants got very hot
He started to look for a clue
First he examined a paine of glass
Then the cause of the fires he knew

Bob told the foreman of his suspicion
And ask if he could take the case
The foreman gave him his permission
And Bob went away with a smiling face.
