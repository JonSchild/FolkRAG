Jean: Good God. We're very sensitive to all these things. Don't 
you think that about one of the decentest classes you'll ever meet.
Lomax: That's what I thoughty- but I never had a chance to ask
anybody the way it went - that's all. I think every people adjust
to circumstances; have their own rules of modesty.
Jean: Yes, I know, Maybe I was old enough to have a place to myself.
Lomax: When would you be old enough?
Jean: O well I had a place to myself ever since I can remember.
Maybe me - and my older sister stayed with, me - we had a place

Lomax: What did happen to a girl who went wrong --- some girls. . . .
Jean: Oh yes. There's certainly girls goes wrong in our grup, too.

the children were born out of wedlock - it was bad enough upon
the lassie.
Lomax: Would the girl be able to marry again?
Jean: Oh yes. I've seen them married as good as any other body.
Lomax: What would depend on how clever she was.
Jean: It just depended on somebody coming along. As I once heard
a doctor say "There's a sod born every day." In a house where we
stayed there were prostituttes upstairs above us; and we was always
at loggerheads with them. We didn't mind what they did out about
but they took men to their quarters. I mean, we were terrified to
go outside. This one was away taking fits and an ambulance come
