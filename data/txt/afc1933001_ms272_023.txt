When the boys go to the camp work for Uncle Sam in honesty
God will save them in the camp like he did the boys in the
fire of furnace
This war this war got everybody trouble in mind
This war this war got everybody praying now

When they open the furnace door people don't you all see
Layed two boys in the fire of furnace and now there lay three
This war this war got everybody trouble in mind
This war this war got everybody praying now

They calling them from the east and they calling them from
               the west
Going to the camp to work for Uncle Sam boys you all do
               your best
This war this war got everybody trouble in mind
This war this war got everybody praying now

When the boys get their calls cards Walk out the mother door
Going to the camp to work for Uncle Sam and happen never
                 been there before
This war this war got everybody trouble in mind
This war this war got everybody praying now.
