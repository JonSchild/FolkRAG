Williams, Bill

Song’s of the Axis
Hitler - I never “drempt” I’d dwell in Harlem. 
Hiro Hito. Things aren’t what they used to be.  
Mussilini - I’ll never smile again.

There were many ruler’s of various 
countries, but at present can not think 
of them. These popular songs are given 
to the various Dictators and Ruler’s in 
view of there present battles and standing 
places in the present war situation.

Joke’s such as:
Q. What does Hitler say when he sees 
a new born baby?
A. Hotsy totsy, another Little Nazie.
