Open letter to 
the Muckle Toun 
o' the Langholm 

20 Melville Terrace, 
Edinburgh, 
January 1977 
DEAR Muckle Toun, - Last 
year I had, once again, the 
pleasure and privilege of 
attending your Common Riding 
- as ever, one of the truly 
prodigious, events of the Scottish 
calendar. I have often told 
visitors from the South (and 
other airts) that if they are 
desirous of witnessing what is 
just about the most gallus 
manifestation of "ingenium 
perfervidum Scotorum" that 
the country can offer, they 
have no need to proceed 
farther than a mere eight miles 
this side of the Border. 
All that's necessary, usually, 
is to play them a few tape-recordings 
made over the years 
- the flute band playing 
reveille by the Esk in the early 
morning: the wild gallop of the 
Cornet and hundreds of horsemen 
up the steep brae of 
Kirk Wynd; the crying of the 
Fair (by a crier standing on 
horseback), and the marching 
and counter-marching of pipe, 
flute and brass bands - and 
the date duly goes down in 
their diaries. In 1976 a Swedish 
television team joined the 
column as well, and added a 
valuable film record to the 
archives. 
However, the experience 
itself invariably surpasses 
memories and anticipations. 
For me, the most thrilling 
moment is always when the 
Cornet and his mounted 
followers appear once again at 
the top of Kirk Wynd, after 
climbing to the summit of 
Whita Hill and performing the 
ceremonial ride-around of its 
landmark monument. The pipe-major 
gives the word of command 
to his men, when he sees 
the horsemen, and the children 
who have formed up behind 
the band lift up their heather 
besoms with the roses entwined 
in them, and cheer as they 
march forward into the square. 
Then there's the moment 
when the walloping outsize 
thistle, with its prickly tentacles 
capering in the air, joins 
the procession of emblems. 
First comes the "bannock and 
saut herrin," its escort linking 
arms and singing "The Bonny 
Wood o' Craigielea"; then 
there's the spade, decorated 
with heather "lately pulled 
frae Whitaside," which has 
been used for cutting sods on 
the common land by men able 
and willing "to gang oot in 
defence of their property"; then 
there's the Crown of Roses bobbing 
in the lift; and last of all, 
the "breenging growth" itself, 
the contumacious camsteerie 
national symbol, greeted all 
along the route with a special 
cheer. 
Last year a small boy of nine 
or ten was sitting on a window 
ledge, just behind where I was 
standing, and I heard him 
exclaim "the thistle!" as those 
great jigging green antlers 
hove into view. Any lucky spectator 
witnessing the incident 
would have learned a lot in a 
moment about the Borders, and 
about Scotland - the old Scotland, 
and the renascent new. 
"The aucht-fit thistle wallops 
on hie" . . . and that reminds 
me, Muckle Toun, why I am 
writing you this open letter 
today. 
Your Common Riding is 
indeed a noble occasion, but 
you possess another and, some 
would say, greater glory than 
the Common Riding, although 
you've aye been gey sweir to 
admit it. I refer, of course, to 
Christopher Murray Grieve, alias 
Hugh MacDiarmid, who is now 
universally acknowledged to be 
one of the greatest poets we 
have ever had in this country, 
And also one of the foremost 
poets now living in the world. 
Muckle Toun o' the 
Langholm, I'm hardly revealing 
any secrets when I say that 
this particular prophet has 
been all too long without 
honour in his own home town. 
There have been attempts, off 
and on, to give him the 
"Freedom," but they never got 
anywhere. And although I 
know Chris Grieve was given a 
presentation by your citizens 
on his eightieth birthday, I 
gather that all the subscriptions 
barring a very few came 
from outwith your boundaries. 
I'm not contending, of 
course, that in this troubled 
relationship the fault that has aye 
been on your side. In the rammies 
of life Chris Grieve has 
given at least as many blows as 
he has taken, and seeing that 
he would not wish us, in 
mim-mou'd Southron style, to 
be "nice" with him, let us 
freely admit that he can be a 
rale coorse carnaptious auld 
blellum, when the mood takes 
him. I, too, have had my share 
of flytings with him over the 
years, and I am quite sure that 
he would be game for another 
one right now, at the drop of a 
hat. 
However, this alters nocht of 
the undoubted fact that he is 
one of the splendours of our 
literature, a man of rare 
genius, and (like Johnnie 
Armstrong o' Gilnockie) a true 
hero of Border history. He 
deserves better of you than he 
has got. 
So, Muckle Toun - what 
about it? I know that the reorganisation 
of local government 
has robbed you of the power to 
make Chris a Freeman of 
Langholm. However, this is of 
no account. (I very much 
doubt, anyway, if Chris 
would wish to be accommodated 
in the same galere as a 
mere astronaut.) May I, with 
respect, offer a suggestions? 
Every year, for the last twenty-five 
years, Chris has visited 
Langholm as a private visitor 
on the occasion of the Common 
Riding. Why not make him a 
guest of honour in 1977? 
Alternatively, you could invite 
him to a birthday celebration 
on August 11, when he will be 
85, and do him proud in traditional 
Border style. 
It would be very appropriate, 
let alone the anniversary, that 
this should happen in 1977, for 
this is undoubtedly the year 
that Scotland will make a 
major step forward towards 
independence - the goal that 
Christopher Murray Grieve has 
devoted his life to help bring 
about. And, Muckle Toun, when 
he thought of Scotland, and 
Scotland's potential, it's plain 
he often thought of you. 

Are you equal to life as to the 
loom? 
Turnin' oot shoddy or 
what? . . . 
Lenin and Rilke baith gied still 
mair skill. 
Coopers o' Stobo, to a 
greater concern 
Than you devote to claith in 
the mill. 
Wad it be ill to learn 
To keep a bit eye on their 
looms as weel, 
And no' be hailly ta'en up 
wi' your 'tweel'? 

Muckle Toun, I have to 
admit that I got the idea of 
writing you this letter on 
another birthday that came up 
for celebration recently 
- namely that of the "bon sans-culotte 
Jesus," around whose 
mystery so many of Chris 
Grieve's own poems dip and 
circle like seabirds. I'd like, 
therefore, to end with some 
lines written by Chris's old 
friend and benefactor, the late 
Helen B. Cruickshank - who 
was not only a marvellous 
person, but also a much better 
poet than the lazy anthologist, 
repeating and repeating "Shy 
Geordie," would ever have you 
believe. Here are the concluding 
lines of the epistle she 
wrote for C. M. Grieve (whom 
she described as "chief pilly-dacus 
o' the haill clanjamfrie") 
when he reached the 
age of 75. 

I mind o' ane that bore in wind 
and weather 
A sacred load thro cataracts o' 
thocht. 
Na, Christopher, yer faither and 
yer mither 
They didna wale that wechty 
name for nocht. 

I am, Muckle Toun, your 
maist leal, devote and obleeged 
servitour. 

Hamish Henderson. 

All best wishes for 1977. Slainte! Hamish
