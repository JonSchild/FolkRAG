I am writing to you as I know you are the one to whom we ship 
samples of our Red Seal releases each month.
I wish to talk to some of the music authorities in the Library
especially concerning Indian and American Folk music. The
following names have been suggested to me:
Mr. Oscar Spevak
Mr. C. L. Bouve
Mr. Alan Lomax.
I would appreciate it very much if you could arrange to have 
these gentleman or any others that you feel I might consult
on these subjects give me some time during the day of June 23
or at some time during the afternoon of June 22.
I hope that my request will not cause you any inconvenience.
Very truly yours,
R. P. Wetherald
