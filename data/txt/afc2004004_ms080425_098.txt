Tamara's work Indentations indicate new speaker #229 begins S. Harp 1

Hugh: This songbook is dedicated to all lovers of Sacred Harp music and to the
memory of the illustrious and venerable patriarchs who established the
traditional style of Sacred Harp singing and admonished their followers to
seek the old path and walk therein. If you notice, it's got a chapter on
music--     a history of the original Sacred Harp, a sketch of
the author and composer of this tune     and anthems have been included
in this revision. Perhaps it would not be out of place for this writer to
make a few observations on the subject of music, the greatest art and
science to attract the attention of mankind since the advent of the human
family into the world. God, himself, in the beginning set all things to
music, even before man was made, and it has been continued from that time
up to the present and will continue throughout eternity. Back as far as
Jubal, the father of all such, has handled(?) the harps, the pipes and
organ, Genesis 4.21. Music is mentioned 3875 years before Christ. Vocal
choruses of men are mentioned in the Bible 556 years before Christ. Two
of the oldest books in the Bible, Genesis and Job(?), refers to the music
element which entered into the religious service of the Jews from their
earliest history.    music the deliverance of the Jews from Egypt
bondage was preferred. Its sweetness marks the banks of the Red Sea rings
with joy as the Jews were delivered. So you see, music has been going on
since time; since time's been here, people have enjoyed music. You know,
this songbook is...the Sacred Harp... really there's no such thing as
Sacred Harp music. That's merely the name of our songbook. We could
be called fa-sol-la singers or shape-note singers. When the man first wrote
this book he says, "I need to get a good name for it." So he says, "This
book is so sacred tomme that I want to name it 'The Sacred Harp'." And
the harp arises(?) from your voice because we use no     . And
