Now all was quiet, not even the 
splashing of the water could be heard. 
Every man had a look on his face of kill
or be killed. All were watching and 
waiting to have the command given 
and location as to where to fire their 
large dept charges.

At last it came, there were three 
large blasts, which came from the U.S 
ship. It rocked and rolled, but still not 
a sound from the sub.

Then suddenly the sound came; 
a torpedo flashing or, streaking through 
the water. It hit the Arizonia dead 
center; water began to rush in, but 
the Arizonias gunners did not leave 
their stations until at last they really 
had a bead on the sub. They fire two 
depth charges which blasted the subs 
bout out of the water. By this time the water locks 
had been closed, and the hole had been 
padded, and then the Arizonia lempted
 into some unknown port.
