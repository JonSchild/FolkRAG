Greenville, Leach, were choristers and had bands.  Usually those who took up 
the fight on band members having important places in the church had something 
else up their sleeve.  The attitude toward local people playing music and the 
attitude toward travelling musicians and musicians in shows was different.  
Travelling musicians and musicians in shows were supposed to be bad.  We had 
one incident I remember that was funny.  When Eugene Booze married at Mound 
Bayou we carried our band down there, and the people cut up about us playing 
in the church.  We thought it was going to be all right, but we didn't know 
those people.  I remember one old lady saw the trombone and she hollered, 
"Look, there's the devil's pitchfork."  That was about 1901.

I didn't pay much attention to the blues and that music until Handy 
came here.  He didn't either when he first came here.  I remember when we 
first became conscious of it.  We were playing down at Cleveland for a dance 
and the people had been dancing but they had gotten tired and sleepy and nobody 
was dancing much except a few couples on the floor.  We took and intermission 
and three fellows came in there with a guitar, a mandolin, and a bass 
violin, and started to play.  When they played the people began to get wild.  
Everybody woke up and got interested and began to dance.  Handy got the idea.
He went back in the corner and took his pencil and a piece of paper and copied 
a part of what they were playing.  That part he copied went like this [(here he did a little tune).]  When Handy went from here to Memphis he finished the piece 
after working on it for a couple of years, and called it "Mr. Crump," and 
later the "Memphis Blues."  It's the same thing we heard that night at Cleveland 
(again the tune).  We caught on, and when we came back to play we played 
that part we remembered, and improvised to make out.
