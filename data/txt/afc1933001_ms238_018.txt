LAW OFFICE OF
Y.W.HOLMES
COMANCHE, TEXAS
April 21st, 1941.

Mr. John Avery Lomax.
Dallas, Texas.

Dear Friend:
Mrs. Holmes is preparing a feature story, to sell to
a newspaper, about the subject in the inclosed notes. We
thought there might be something here which would interest
you in relation to your ballad collecting. The several lines
from various songs are given, so you may judge of whether you
have them, and whether it looks as if they might interest you.
If so, you may be coming down some time soon, when I will take
you out to see her, about seven miles out Highway 67.
Mrs. Holmes has in mind to get a picture of her while 
singing, to go along with the story. If you should intend to
come, she intends to hold up until after you come. If you should
think worth while to come, and you have a recording machine, I 
imagine it would be worth while to bring it. he sings the 
songs very well.

Your Friend,
Y.W. Holmes
