Mr. Alan Lomax,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Alan: -

Mr. Paul Brewster has showed me the letter you wrote 
him about coming out to our folklore meeting in April. I 
hope you can get together on a song-recording expedition.  
The main purpose of this letter is to urge you and Mrs. 
Lomax to come on a few days early and pay us a visit.
(The Thompsons, I mean)

Think this over prayerfully.

Cordially yours,
Stith Thompson
