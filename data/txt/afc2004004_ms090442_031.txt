Fisk, 10. 9.

Frankie went to the hop joint,
But she didn't have no fear.
She sees Albert smoking hop cigarettes,
And the women all buying him beer.
He's her man,
But he done her wrong.

She shot him once;
She shot him twice,
And he fell down on the floor.
"Turn me over, baby;
The bullets hurt me so."
He's her man,
But she done him wrong.

Frankie went to Albert's mother,
And fell down on her knees.
"I've killed your son, Albert;
Forgive me, if you please.
He's my man,
But he done me wrong."

Albert's mother told Frankie
To "Please take my advice.
Don't never love a poor man so,
That you have to take hislife.
He's your man,
But you done him wrong."

A: Where did [you] that happen, do you know?

About Mr. Greek Rice.

Greek Rice never have hopped up nobody, nothing like that -- beat up 
nobody. I think really that he's a fine high sheriff. He's just only 
'forcing the law. He broke up all crap games and things like that, sitting 
around town and allowing no shop to play on Sunday, everything 
like that. He feel like he trying to get the people to go to church 
more [and] than they have been, you know. I never thought that he's 
done nothing wrong, and what he have did, you know, lots of people 
have been giving the church and go to Sunday school[l]. Everything 
close up at 12 o'clock on Sunday. (For white and colored). Yeah, for 
white and colored, all the same. Close up Sunday after dinner. Everybody 
go to Sunday school, no crap games. (They made the law themselves) 
Yeah, they made the law themselves, and he's just 'forcing it, that's 
what he's doing.
