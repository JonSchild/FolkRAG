Adequate and accurate information about the war--plus the
confidence among the American people that they are receiving adequate
and accurate information about the war--will help to allay the
tensions created by war, and will therefore help to reduce the volume 
of rumors. But it is clear that as long as war continues to 
produce a successions of situations about which there is bound to be
apprehension, even the most complete information will not be able to
destroy rumors entirely.
Rumors feed upon many human traits: our prejudices, our 
fears, our anxieties, our curiosity, our desire to share a secret or
repeat an "inside" story, our simple love of gossip. In wartime, 
people naturally tend to seize upon material which reflects their
individual fears, their individual hopes, or their fundamental prejudices.
People repeat rumors for a variety of reasons. Some people 
give vent to their basic hates by repeating rumors which spread
prejudice. Some people try to reduce their own uneasiness by passing
it on to others--in the form of rumors. Some people spread
rumors because telling supposedly "secret" or "inside" information
gives then a sense of importance. Some people repeat rumors as an
unconscious way of escaping from hard realities through wishful
stories.  And some people just like to gossip--without realizing
that they may be spreading false information, creating false fears,
or rising false issues.
