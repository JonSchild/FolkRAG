Letter postmarked Birmingham Ala Jan 5, 1935

Twenty One Years

The judge said stand up [?]
And dry up your tears 
You're sentence to Nashville 
For twenty-one years
So kiss me good bye babe,
And say you'll be mine
For twenty-one years babe,
Is a mighty long time,
So look down the railroad,
As far as you can see
Keep right on [?]
Your farewell to me,
The steam from the whistle,
The smoke from the stack,
I'll know you'll be true [?]
Until I get back.
So kiss me good bye babe,
And say you'll be mine
For twenty-one years babe,
Is a mighty long time,
Oh go beg the [?]
To save your sweet soul.
If you can't get a pardon
Please get a [?].
