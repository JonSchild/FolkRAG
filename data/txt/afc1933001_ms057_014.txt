Brownsville, Tex.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
1. Send me, please, University Station, Austin, Texas a "To
Whom it may Concern" letter of introduction that will serve to
get me by Governors, wardens, and such like. One signed by you
will suffice.
A dozen small-sized blanks records for gifts to singers
would help me over many rough places.
Thanks.  Yours,
John A. Lomax
