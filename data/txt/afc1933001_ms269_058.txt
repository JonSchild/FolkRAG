When I have asked folk singers how many songs they knew,
they have told me, "Why if I began now and sang every night for
a week, I'd never sing the same song twice".
The singers who are on the stage here with me all could
make this boast. All could make this boast good. They are
American folk singers on the lavish Davy Crochett pattern and
they know the thousands of songs and ballads that have been
created in process of the settlement of this continent in the
same lavish fashion as they have grown corn, cut lumber, built
cities and invented cuse words.
If they didn't have an instrument, they made one. If they
didn't know but one tune, they played it all night, like the cowpuncher
who came with his fiddle to a lonely ranch and played the
one tune he knew all week long so that the neighbors for hundreds
of miles could get in a little dancing.
If they didn't know the ways of conventional music, they
knew the ways their fathers and mothers had taught them. They
liked their own rules better than book-learnt rules. They made
Yankee Doodle, Dixie, Dan Tucker, Susannah, The Cake Walk, St.
Louis Blues, The Arkansas Traveler, Zip Coon, Minnie the Moocher,
A-tisket, a -tasket, Hinky, dinky-parley-vous.
