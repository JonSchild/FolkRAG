We are at war now, and
we have many of relative in
this war who are fighting
to try to win this war so we 
are freedom of everything.

I have a cousin in this
war is in army fighting against
Japenese.  He is in England about
every three months we receive
a letter saying that he is well
and he is a caporal or Sergeant.
We are also trying to win this
war by helping our country.
Buy war stamps and bonds, and
work in Defense Plant.

Most of us think about our boys
in the Armed forces. We have
rationed our sugar and shoes and
canned goods so every body has an
equal amount and the boy that
are fighting will have enough
to eat.

I think that every one should
do his share to try to win this
war and the only way we can
win is by doing the right thing.
