July 11, 1957


Dear Alan: 

I have just returned from a vacation to find your
letter of June 18.
   
In answer to your request for a count of the Archive's
contents, I am enclosing a copy of a report we recently sent the
International Folk Music Council. It does not include an enumeration
of separate songs, as there is no accurate count at present.
    
Although I did not know about your photoduplication
request, I understand that Mr. Spivacke's letter to you, dated June
17, has explained the absence of the items from The Columbian Harmony
and Ingalls' Christian Harmony from your order. You have no doubt
received his letter, referring you to the proper libraries, by this
time. As for "Idumea" and "Weeping Mary," I gather that you did not
specify that you did not want the copies made from The Sacred Harp.
On the contrary, your letter of April 22 says, after the "Indumea"
entry, ".... Original Sacred Harp, J. S. Jones, Atlanta, 1911 --- or,
if this is copyright, in the 1844 edition of Sacred Harp....." implying 
that you preferred the modern edition. In the absence of any 
instructions to the contrary, "Weeping Mary" was taken from the same
volume as this was more convenient for the Library and less expensive
for you.
   
I hope the enclosure will provide you with all the
necessary information.
   
George is still trying to get you the information on Joe
Brown's coal mine. We shall look forward to the publication of your
new book.

With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
