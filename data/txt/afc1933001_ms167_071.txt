Nobody's Darling. 
I'm out in this wide world alone,
Walking about in the street.
Asking a penny for bread,
Begging for somthing to eat.
Oh! how the north wind,
Chilles my frane.
Sitting on poverly's knee,
For I am nobody's darling.,
Nobody cares for me
ChoRUS
Nobody darling on earth I know,
Heven will murciful be,
For I am nobody's darling,
Nobody cares for me.
Often at night when I kneel,
Lifting my sorryful eye's.
Asking mother to smile,
Down on her child from the sky.
Then I forget all my pain,
Mother in heven I see.
Then I am somebody's darling.
