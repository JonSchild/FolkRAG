Burlington, N. C.

Dear Fletcher:

We are hoping to receive your records
any day now. Please send them as soon
as possible. I think you understand how 
important it is that you not use them
for transcribing before sending them. 
The amount of wear involved in transcribing
would ruin them for our purposes. 

It was nice to have you at our 
conference. As soon as the Utilization
Committee begins to work I will get in
touch with you.

Cordially,
Alan
