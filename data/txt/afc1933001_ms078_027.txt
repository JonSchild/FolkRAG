Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Smith:

    I'm sending you, herewith, a half dozen circulars that
give information about Alan. About a year ago last September,
John Roger Williams wrote a long story about Alan which appeared
in the Dallas Times Herald. That story, in connection with his
two articles in the Southwest Review and the books he has done
with me, will give you a lot of material about him. At present,
he's doing a bi-monthly broadcast for Columbia Broadcasting System
on the School of Air Series, he is co-author with Nickolas Ray
for a tri-weekly program called Back Where I Come From over C.B.S.
Also is at present in charge of the Archive of American Folk Song
in the Library of Congress. I'm giving Alan all this information
and the rest of the details, please get from him,- if you can. He's
a pretty busy man. I've heard him lecture twice since I've been
in Washington, and if you'll pardon a father's opinion, it's a jam-up
show.

    Sincerely yours,
    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Curator and Consultant
    on Folk Song.
    Library of Congress

P.S. As you know, I made previous arrangements with you for Alan's
lecture last September. I knew nothing then about his contract
with the Columbia Lecture Bureau. I should say that this is a
private arrangement between you, Alan and me.
