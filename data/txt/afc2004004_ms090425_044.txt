Fisk 21, 10
Mrs. Roxie Threadgill & women
high pitched -
shrill passion
Cho I'm gon lean on the Lord.
Lean on the Lord.
Now when my troubles rise
I'm gon lean on the Lord

1) On the time my God will come
Bright flames preparing the way
The thunder, darkness, fire & storm
Be's on the dreadful day
Cho.

_? _ I am
My soul is at a stand
The seas before me and the host behind me
And the rocks on the either hand
-
What have I gained by sinning , Lord,
Was hongry shame & fear
My fathers house is bound in bread
Whilst we are storming here
-
Here I stand awaiting
The blessings in my hand
And if you come & get them
I'll give you the promised land
They seels my hand in weakeness
They say he couldn't be found
He filled my heart with sweeteness
And he turned me all around
