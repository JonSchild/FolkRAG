Mr. Alan Lomax,
I recieved your letter to'day
not feeling well hope you are
fine writing you about
[my] the address. 1617 Lee St
is Wrong, my address is 
1701 London St.
So please send my mail to this

Some times we have new
mail carrier and they would
not know me by name, some of them
know me by my name, and 
they will bring it to my house

This is why I am writing

to do
