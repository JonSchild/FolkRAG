BJ TAPE 11, p. 2

Anyway, they got that there just to remember an' recognizin' 
the old slave, ya know?  Ah, the rice farmer.  Still keepin' it, 
ya know, up.  They coulda let it grow up in weeds an' bushes, 
quite natchully.  It coulda been nothing but a fores' in there.  
'Cause right below it, you know, is where the big -- the great 
creek there, river, sumthin' like that is there.  [They on ?] The Darien River, 
[the river] you know, right below it, ya see?

TL:    What does the river look like?

BJ:    Well, jus' a river, ya know.  A river a water.  Ya know where 
the bridge go across.  But any-anyway, ya know rice [must] hasta be in a 
low place, near the river, ya see?

An' also they raise a whole lot a ce'ery (celery) an' ah, 
um, ah, what this 'un?  Lettuce.  An' um, cabbages, all like [in] that.

Now they did that since I been on the Island.  They raised 
cabbages and, ah, lettuce.  Folks would have -- I see they have 
on their boots, like, you know, wadin' out in them places.  But
now they done stopped that.  Ah, oh, 'cause all the lettuce 
farms is goin' down.  They change to sumpin' else, ya know?  But 
all the lettuce fields are not, -- Ain't nothin' in the lettuce fields on 
the side a the highway when I left there.  Just ah -- you know -- 
ah, they gonna build a highway from there across, so I heard, 
from somewhere between that -- between Darien an' between the, 
ah, there's a place there they call, ah, Dead Man Curve.  Somewhere 
between the Dead Man Curve an' ah, Darien, they's gonna 
build a highway.  An' that highway [gonna] will come out right near 
the port of, of St. Simons.  Well, ah, ah, ah, fort, I mean, not
