I happened to come to myself. Come to me, Now what am I runnin from?
Now ain't I a fool! Caught mysef runnin round! What good would that
do me? If that had been Death?
( what do you imagine Death looks like, Rev. Davis?)
Come to me as a deep shower of rain. Don't know how
it come to nobody else. A dar k, deep shower of rain.
I dreamed about a ['lectrician] 'lecturicutin one night. I woke up
an found mysef alive, an you know I was the proudest soul in the
worl! I'm tellin you the troof. I thought I was[in] in the death 
cell. I was surprised to find I was at home.
(Did you dream of the electricution itself?)
Sometimes like that....Ah-h-h-h-h-uh! (a deep sigh)
(One of the greatest men in the world died today.)
Who that?
(His name was George Bernard Shaw. H e wrote books and
plays. He lived in England. For about the last sixty or seventy
years he has written books that show that human beings should all
be equal. That discrimination should be done away with. H e
was a very great man, and I was very sorry that he died. His death
was reported this morning, and he was ninety-four years old.)
Well I declare! Yeah!
(He lived a long, long time, and I had begun to feel
that he would live forever. But I guess nobody can live forever.)
(his voice very drowsy)....it just come his time to go...
(he sleeps for a while)

Thass reason [nio] nothin don't go hard with me now,
you see.
(Do you feel you've developed an unusual strength or
toughness, Rev. Davis?)
