1. There are a lot of Germans in Norway,
That are buried in snow all the way
When asked "Are you cold,"
They said the "Allies are bold,"
But we don't call this cold in Norway.

2.No matter how grouchy the Japs may be
feeling,
You'll find much joy in more or less in
keeling - them.

3. Whenever you see a beautiful girl kneeling,
I know you want to start feeling feeling feeling.
