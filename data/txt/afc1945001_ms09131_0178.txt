I have heard through a German friend whose
two brothers are in the Natzi army, that
there is a great surge of unrest spreading
over the German people and these two
boys say that before long there will
probably be a revolt among the people
in Germany.

I have heard that perhaps Hitler isn't 
alive. That he died in a fit of frenzy or
anger and that is place has been filled
by Goring.
