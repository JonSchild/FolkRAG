-4- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York 8-18-42

     New York 8-10 (Businessman): "Nazi successes in Russia have 
been more far-reaching than newspaper reports have stated. The situation
now is extremely critical." 

     New York 8-11: "Unless a second front is formed soon to relieve
the pressure on Russia, this war will be a lot shorter than most commentators
have been saying. Russia will sign with Germany and the war will be over."

ones - - only for the big ones. They cost $10,000 each." 

           Long Island City 8-14: "You think you know so much. Yes,
