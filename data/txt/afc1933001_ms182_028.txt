Dear Mr. Lomax:

For a number of years the faculty of Western
Michigan College and the Kalamazoo public schools have
cooperated in sponsoring a lecture course, the aim of
which is to bring to the community -

(a)  Men and women who are well-known because of
their accomplishments.

(b)  Speakers who have a message, especially for the
young people.

(c)   Entertainment of greater value than is offered
in the local theaters.

As you will see from the admission prices quoted
in the enclosed folder there is no attempt to make
money on this project. Our ambition has been to serve
the community in some way, especially the young people
of our three colleges and our high schools.

Our audiences number from 2500 to 3000, most of
whom find some way of letting our committee know the
person or persons  they would like included on the
next year's schedule.  If satisfactory arrangements
could be made, would you be available for our next year's
course? We should like you to send us a list of
possible dates, tell us your fee, and any other
information which you feel might be useful to us.

Yours very truly,

Harvey J. Bouck
