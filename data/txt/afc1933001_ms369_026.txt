Lully lulley, lully lulley,
The faucon hath borne my make away. (Refrain)

He bare him up, he bare him down,
He bare him into an orchard brown.

In that orchard there was a hall,
Which hanged was with purpill and pall.

And in that hall there was a bed,
It was hanged with gold so red.

And in that bed there lith a knight,
His wondes bleding day and night.

By that bedside kneleth a may,
And she wepeth both knight and day.

And by that bed there stondeth a stone,
Corpus Christi wreten thereon.

Lully lulley, lully lulley,
The faucon hath borne my make away.
