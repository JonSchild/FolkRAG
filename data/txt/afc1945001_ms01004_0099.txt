INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THE KIND 
OF RUMORS WE ARE INTERESTED IN

1. Rumors vary in specificity. 

We want tales about named people or organizations, often labelled as to time, place, numbers. We do not want vague generalizations.

2. Rumors vary according to freedom of dissemination. 

We are most interested in covert rumors of the whispering campaign variety. We are less interested in unrestricted rumor that are picked up by newspapers and radios.
