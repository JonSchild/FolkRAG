An interesting anecdote is
the one about Rickenbocker. 
The story is a bout how
he a some of his me n cheated
death 22 days There was very little
food to divide among them +
when that was gone they went on
hoping and believing that some time
or another someone would rescue
them. So on this rubber raft
they went on and on into the
rough sea When they were rescued
they knew there prayers were answered
Americans all over the world now still
talked about this great man who
was willing to give his life that his
country may live
