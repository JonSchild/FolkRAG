IN THE AGRICULTURE WEST
Tune--Let The Rest of The World Go By.

With pigs and pigs to squeal,
Until your mind will reel.
With cows and cows to milk,
No matter how I feel,
I'm up at morn, always quite worn,
Never stop to feel forlorn.
With lantern at night,
At morn before light,
We'll work to save our homes so bright.
We'll build a sweet little nest,
In the agriculture west,
And let the rest of the world go by.

With turkeys on the roost,
And prices hard to boost,
With what we buy so high,
It nearly hits the sky,
We'll have to fight to get things right,
Let's step up with all our might.
We'll build a market plan,
To save the cause of man,
To sell for price of what we buy.
We'll build a co-op way,
As all the farmers say,
And let the rest of the world go by.

STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR THE F. E. C. U.
Tune--Carry Me Back To Old Virginia.

Stand up and fight for the F-E-C-U.
There's where our farm cause will win or meet defeat,
There's where the flat of our fate floats above us,
Forward, advance now, no time to call retreat.
The Union will save us if farmers will line up,
Should to shoulder and dare a holy dare;
Step up with courage with faith of a hero,
Act like a soldier, a volunteer in war.
Stand up and fight for F-E-C-U.
There's where our farm cause will win or meet defeat,
There's where the flag of our fate floats above us,
Forward, advance now, no time to call retreat.
