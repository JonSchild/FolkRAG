Dallas.
3/26/1941

Dear Alan : That $1 44 telegram 
proved to be a dud of 
purest ray serene, but still you 
were justified in bringing me 
word. The story is too long to 
write out, I'm busy sheming 
how to get my money back.

The enclosed envelope 
reached me today. I'm nearlty
as highly flattered as when you 
tried to swap Johnny out of his 
name. I'm shooting your letter 
to him along. Unless you air mail 
me some of your lecture circulars I can't move 
a peg about other engagements
Lovingly,
Father -
