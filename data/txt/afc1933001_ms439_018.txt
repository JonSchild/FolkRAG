Ol' lady said to de ol' man,
"I'm trying my level bes',
To keep these devilish boil weevils
Outta my ol' cotton dress.
I'ts full o' holes,
It's full o' holes.

Farmer taken the boll weevil,
Fed him on Paris green,
Boll weevil said to de farmer,
"IT8s de best I ever seen.["]
I'll have a home,
I'll have a home."

Ef anybody should ask you,
Who composed this song,
Tell 'em was a dark-skinned nigger,
Wid a pair of blue duckin's on.
Jus' lookin for a home,
Jus' lookin for a home.
He's lookin for a home, (4).
