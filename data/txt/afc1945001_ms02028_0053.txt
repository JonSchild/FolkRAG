OPA

Woman worker, 8-12-42: "There is something funny about the IOWA OPA. In Texas there are 50 girls already on the payroll doing the kind of consomer education work I am applying for, and in Des Moines there isn't one yet." 
Woman worker, good education, 8-12-42: "Apparently the intention is that all administrative people in OPA must be college people. One man high in the regional office told me he was being demoted and a college man appointed in his place because OPA didn't figure anyone except college professors could run the program."
