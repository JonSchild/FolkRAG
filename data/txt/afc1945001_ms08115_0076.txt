I.  This became a hell of a world when
Hitler fried Turkey in Greece.

II.  Cannons to the left of them
Cannons to the right of them
Cannons in front of them & cannons behind them.
They fought & fought well, yes they fought like hell,
As they fought & some fell in the ditch, one man
cried here's to Hitler the Son of a bitch.
