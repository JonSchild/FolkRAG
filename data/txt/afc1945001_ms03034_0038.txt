Dear Mr. Knapp: 

       I am glad to know that you will be here next 
week and shall look forward to meeting you.    Our office 
is located in Room 300, Library of Congress Annex, and 
the telephone number is Republic 7500, Extension 2784. 

      War trophies are a little bit out of our line 
but we will see what we can do to put you in touch with 
someone who has a collection. 

Sincerely yours, 

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
