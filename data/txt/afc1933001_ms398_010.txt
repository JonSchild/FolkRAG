The Swenson Ranch is located under the Cap rock in West Texas not far from
that immense stretch of upland once called the Staked Plains. There are
four divisions of the ranch, the headquarters office being at Stamford. 
Here at Stamford on each fourth of July is held a Cowboy Reunion where only
real ranch hands are allowed to compete for the prizes in bronco busting,
steer riding, calf roping, fiddling, and other ranch activities.

I have picked up much Cowboy material in my frequent visits to 
the ranch. Two summers ago while riding with some of the men I noticed each
cowhorse had a name. Fifty cowboys each with a string of eight horses -- 
big Morgan or Steeldust breeds with a slight strain of mustang to give them
toughness -- makes a total of some 400 different names. I took a list of
them all. Here I give a fair cross section of forty-four -- while at the
ranch I rode Whistling Rufus and Rocking Ann, appropriate names for beautiful  
horses.
