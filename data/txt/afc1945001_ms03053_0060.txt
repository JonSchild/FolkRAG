Government $750 a day just to clean out the cesspools at Santa Anita. No
sewage. The way that thing was handled is a crime. If they had put the Japs
some place else and kept the track open, they could have financed the whole deal

some of these things." (Ogden property owner and sports promoter)

     "I'm here on a little vacation. I'm working at Mare Island Navy
Yard in Vallejo. Somebody ought to drop a couple of bombs on that place and make
them start working instead of thinking about how much money they're making and
how they can keep making it. I'm telling you it's a crime the way those guys
loaf. I'm just as guilty as the next one at getting mine while the getting's
good, but when you have 32,000 guys doing the same thing, it's something to think
about. Hell, we've had two subs ready to launch for week, but they just keep
tearing them down and putting something on or off and you get the idea they don't 
know what in the hell they do want. Christ, we could put out three times the
stuff we are if we had to. Another thing, they can't employ 'em as fast as they
lose 'em. Every day they have a bunch leaving to go with private companies.
They get in their apprenticeship at Government expense and then go out and work
for a private shipyard at more money." (Mare Island Navy Yard Worker)

they're ready, day or night." (Advance man for Cole Bros. Circus)
