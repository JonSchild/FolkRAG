My dear Mr. Lomax - 

In a collection of American Shanties to which I have written accompaniments this summer, I have chosen the "WhisKey Johnny" of your collection as the [?]. I have written fourteen to Richard Martl and's[?] and about five to Miss Joanna Cleme's and have their permission to use.

Now I am asking permission to use yours. Unfortunately we can never ask permission until we have already used them for our private delight. But I wish to have these published and I therefore ask the courtesy of your permission.

I am
Very sincerely yours.
