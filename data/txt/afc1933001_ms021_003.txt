two months sang a petition for 
pardon on a record, addressed 
to Governor O.K. Allen. I carried
the [R] record back to Baton Rouge,
a hundred miles away. The 
Governor listened to it, and then 
pardoned Leadbelly. He came on 
to Texas and attached himself
to me. He says that I will
never again have to tie my shoes
if I "don't want to." When I 
come to Washington in January 
I'll bring him along and give 
you and Mrs. Strunk a specimen 
of Negro music as interpreted
by a real Negro.
Don't try to reach me 
except through Austin. I'm
doing Alabama next.  Regards and 
best wishes. Yours, 
John A. Lomax
