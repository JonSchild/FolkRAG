-15- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York 8-13-42
New York 8-11: "An aircraft carrier was sunk fifteen miles off
Coney Island last week. A German submarine did it."
Yonkers 8-15: "There was a Nazi submarine right in Long Island
Sound three days ago. A friend of mine knows a tug captain who said it fired
a torpedo at a tanker but missed."

Miscellaneous
New York 8-9 (Housewife): "Why are we fighting for the Solomon
Islands? They aren't worth anything to anybody."
Yonkers 8-12 (Polish-American bus conductor): "It is foolish that
we forget Europe while we waste men to capture the Solomon Islands. The
war started in Poland - why is nothing done to relieve it?"
Buffalo 8-11 (German-American): "We will never have another
Presidential election. The next President will be Roosevelt or Mrs., or
Harry Hopkins or Elliott Roosevelt. Only after this war, they will not
be presidents. They will be dictators."
New York 8-13 (Businessman): "Recent political activities of
the President indicate clearly that he wants a Fourth Term."
New York 8-14: "The President is letting the war slide while
he mixes into New York State politics."
New York 8-12 (Banker): "Should we allow the President to
drop the war whenever he has a whim to play politics? The Army and Navy
should demand that he stick to the war."
New York 8-13 (Middle-aged clothing retailer): "It's a fine
sign of the war sentiment of the country when political leaders come out
publicly against their own party members who are known isolationists. That
man Willkie is a patriot."
Buffalo 8-13: "If it takes five million men, we ought to smash
Berlin first. Forget the Solomon Islands. The Japs are taking orders
from Hitler. When he goes down, the Japs are all through."
