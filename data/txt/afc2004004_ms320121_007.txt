Time Code:     Tape:   1356 Mrs. McGee     1

Mrs. McGee:     ....We moved to Texas.....Well, we stayed
there a year, and we lost almost everything we had, and I
told him, I said, I'm going back to Eunice.   Came back
to Eunice, built a little home about 4 blocks down Kent
St. and we stayed there about 5 ors 6 years, then we went in
the country, farming.   Went 2 or 3 times in the country 
and farming, then came back.
AL:     Was it hard the farming, bad wages?
Mrs. MCG:     Yeah, I didn't work too much in the fields because
I always had 1 or 2 babies to take care of, 3 or 4 r
around, and crying all the time   He was farming with the boy 
And then we got my baby, was so sick from living on the farm, 
I said, I'm not going to live any more on the farm.   I'm 
going back to Eunice, and we come back here.   I'm still here.
And I said, we're not going back, i'm gonna keep my two feet
on the ground.   Ain't gonna move anymore.   Anyway, I lost
a little boy later,on, then a little girl 5 years old.   I
rocked him to sleep, he cried all night, the little boy...
we didn't have no doctor, we couldn't pay no doctor, couldn't
afford no doctor, and sincewe moved down here, well I start
ironing for people and working in the house, and I wash and 
iron for people to survive with my children.   He didn't have
no work.   Then he started having a license to put a barber
shop in my living room....he put a barber shop in that living
romm, that's when he started playing the fiddle again......
