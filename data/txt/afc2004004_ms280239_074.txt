"Is this your bride?" cried she.
"For I thought you the jolly bridegroom
And I the bride to be."

8) "Despise her not, Fair Ellen" he cried,
Despise her not unto me.
For I thought you the jolly bridegroom
And I the bride to be."

It being wonderful sharp.
Between the long ribs and the short
She pierced Fair Elen's heart.

Fairwell to the Alehouse: - Jessie Murray.

1) Wha's that at the door that is speaking so kindly?
It's the voice of my wifie, called Jeannie by name.
You're sitting there drinking and leave me lamenting,
So rise up, my Jimmy, and come awa' hame.

2) Nae mind o'the bairnies that are him greetin',
Nae meal or barley to fill their wee weim,
You're sitting there drinking and leave me lamenting,
So rise up, my Jimmy, and come awa' hame.

3) Farewell to the whiskey that makes me so brisky,
Farewell to the alehouse I'll visit nae mair,
Since Jeannie is waiting her poor heart is breaking,
So fare ye well alehouse, and I'll awa hame.

Skippin' Barfoot Thro' the Heather - Jessie Murray:

1) Will ye come wi' me, my bonnie lass ?
Will ye come wi' me and leave the heather ?
Silks and satins ye will wear
If ye'll come wi' me and leave the heather.

2) O but she was neatly dressed,
She needed neither hat nor feather,
She was the queen among them all,
Skippin' barfut through the heather.

3) O young man, you're offers good,
But it's well I ken ye will deceive me,
But gin ye'll tak' my heart awa'
Better far I had never kenned ye.

4) Repeat verse 2.
