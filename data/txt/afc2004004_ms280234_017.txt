Molly Bawn:
1) Jimmy went fowling with jis dog and his gun,
Fowling all day until evening came on,
Het met with his true love and took her for a swan,
And he shot his Molly Bawn by the settting of the sun.

2) Jimmy went home with his gun in his hand,
Sad and broken-hearted as you may understand.
He said, to his father, "I took her for a swan,
But oh, and alas, it was my own Molly Bawn."

3) It was in six months later, to her Uncle she appeared,
Crying, "Uncle, dear Uncle, don't think to shoot my dear.
With my apron all around me, he took me for a swan,
And he never would have murdered his own Molly Bawn."

The Rocks of Bawn:   Music
1) Come all ye loyal heroes, wherever that you be,
Don't hire with any master till you know what your work will be,
For you must rise up early from the clear daylight till dawn,
Or I'm afraid you'll never be able to plough the rocks of bawn.

2) And me curse attaend you, Sweeny, you have nearly rabbed,
You're sitting by the fireside with your duidann in your goo,
You're sitting by the fireside from the clear daylight till dawn,
And I'm afraid you'll never be able to plough the rocks of bawn.

3) And me shoes are well worn and me stockings they are thin,
And me heart is always trembling - faraid I might give in,
And me heart is always trembling from the clear daylight till dawn,
And I'm afraid I'll never be able to plough the rocks of bawn.

Molly's Bawn:
1) Jimmy went fowling with his dog and his gun,
Fowling all day till evening came on,
He met with his true love and took her for a swan,
But oh abd alas, it was his own Molly Bwn.

2) It was six months after to her Uncle she appeared,
Crying, "Uncle dear Uncle, don't think to shoot my dear,
With my apron all around me, he took me for a swan,
And oh, to his sad grief I was his own Molly Bawn.
