Archibald MacLeish
Librarian of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

Since Alan has been looking after the final details of
Our Singing Country,- (as a matter of fact the book is far more
his than mine), I have only just recently read your generous Foreword.
You have pinned an accolade on us in that fine portrayal of the pattern
and place of folk stuff and tradition in the lives of any people.
Not in my reading anywhere have I found so eloquent and adequate
a statement.

In our work as collectors of folk songs Alan and I have received
scan recognition from many sources in the sections through
which we have traveled. Alan may not have told you that he was once
actually put in jail, (where he promptly went to sleep), by a suspicious
officer who doubted the explanation of his mission, who did
not like his looks, and who doubtless thought that the baggage carried
in the back of his automobile was some sort of an infernal
machine.

Thirty years ago Professors Wendell and Kittredge encouraged
me in my feeble efforts to get the project of collecting folk songs
under way. However, I didn't make much real headway until the Library
of Congress, under the constantly sympathetic encouragement of Mr. Putnam
and Mr. Spivacke, made possible whatever results our contribution to
the Archive of American Folk Song can now exhibit.

At last you come along and from your high tower of preeminence
publicly give the stamp of your approval to a work still in its
beginnings. You have made me grateful and happy, and I thank you again
and again.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
