Miss Terrill is travelling with
me to S.A. It is not necessary
for you to come
by. But we'd like to know
your schedule, whatever it is.
The blue-bonnets are in
full bloom, the mockingbirds
trill outside my window,
Mike has been found and,
wounded, comes back to Emma
and John Alan (largely on your
account), there's quiet peace
in rooms allotted to you, and
your neglectful, unappreciated
foolishly fond father holds
out a welcome for you, whenever
and however you may
come- You of all people in
the universe may understand.
Father.
