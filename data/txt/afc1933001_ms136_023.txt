Miss Charlotte Davis in our office was kind enough to copy the music
and we trust that this material will meet your request.

With reference to the letter to Mr. Doyle Joyce, Vincennes, Indiana,
we desire to advise you that a copy of the Creole monograph is in possession 
of Dr. Botkin in Mr. Alsberg's office and that the French text for
Mon Amour is given on p. 121 of that monograph.

I am sending you a page from the gravure section of the Indianapolis Sunday 
Star of July 17, 1938 which contains pictures of the American Folk Song
Society connected with the celebration at Ashland, Kentucky. I thought you 
would be interested in this article. You likely already know about it and
about this society, but if you do not you will appreciate the article.

We shall be very glad to have you return to Indiana at any time that you
can do so and if we can be of assistance to you, kindly advise us.

Very truly yours,
Signature
