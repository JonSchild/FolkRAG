BJ:  Well, ya know, sometime that sick person git up outa that 
bed, [in the mornin'] that night an' tomorra ya see 'im washin' or workin'.  So it just
means sumpin' to gather together.  You know, aah, ah, more that
anything together, the stronger it is.  You know that?  An' so,
especially when it's, when it's men.  [You] And see, but ah, the less
it is, why, the weaker it is.  You see?
