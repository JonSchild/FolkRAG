Mr. Alan Lomax 
General Delivery 
Salyersville, Kentucky 

Dear Alan: 
I do wish you would get this matter of addresses straight, 
as I am quite sure that you will find your checks and an important 
letter from me awaiting you at West Liberty, Kentucky. 
In this letter I mentioned the possibility of your going to 
Akron, Ohio after you are through in Kentucky. Since I have to 
have the Librarian's approval for this as well as your suggested 
extension of time in Kentucky, please let me have your 
decision as soon as possible. 
Regarding the annual report, all we want this time is a 
factual statement that the Library sent you to Haiti, how long 
you were their, what you did, etc., leaving detailed descriptions 
and scientific studies for the following year. 
I shall send the cutting needles as soon as I can get them 
to you. 
Sincerely yours, 
Acting-Chief, 
Division of Music 
HS
