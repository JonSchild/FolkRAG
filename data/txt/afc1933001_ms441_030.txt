Ef a man don' know, ef a man don' know-----
It's a man lyin' dead on de low turn row.*
Long time man, hold up your head,
You may make it an' you may fall dead.
Go down, ol' Hannah, don' you rise no mo',
Ef you rise in de mornin', bring [jedgement] day.

*A cleared space, several rows wide, [that runs] running across [the fiel]
a field at right angles to the other rows, where the plow
teams can turn without trampling or uprooting the cotton,
[or] cane or corn.
