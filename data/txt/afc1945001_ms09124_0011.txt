America At War.

On December 7, 1941 those dirty
Japs dropped bombs on "Pearl Harbor"
and killed millions of American People
Now it war between United State And
the Japanese Empire. We the United
States was not expecting this sneak
attack on "Pearl Harbor". We was
not in a very good position for a
war at this date. For what I heard
the Japanese was preparing for a war
for twenty years. They have been building
Airplanes, Guns, Ships for twenty years
so you can see how much head
start the Japan had on the United
State. But the United States can take
it we have fought for liberty once
and kept it and we will keep
on "fighting" until "Peace & Liberty"
is on the United States "Forever".
