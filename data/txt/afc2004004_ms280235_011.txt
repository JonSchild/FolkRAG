house. I said, "Could you get me a violin . I'm very fond of a 
violin." 
He says, "It won't be a very good one." 
I says, "I want to practise on it." So he got me this old 
violin, and the bow - there was only two or three hairs on it 
altogether - not much good, like. While I was in that house, 
I lost a whole three months in the summer trying to finger tht 
violin. I never knew what it was to get sleep. Day and night. 
Every minute. 

Lomax:  It's impossible. No one could stay awake that long. 

Barry:  I'm telling you. Of course, I couldn't stop awake that 
long. I did it in between, you know. How does it come that I 
had so much of a craze for that now ? All day. The people 
beside me were annoyed for me playing all night. 

Lomax:  How does music make you feel ? 

Barry: I'll just tell you. When you're fond of music, and come 
from a musical family, and you look back on your own family, 
all her uncles, herself, - every time I cry dreadful. Keep
crying and crying away. Many a time. At a party a man came 
around and started taking down our name and my father's name. 
Then that started me off. I cried and cried and kept crying. 
I never stopped. Even my husband asked me one night, "What are 
you crying for ? You can't bring them back now." 
"Look, man," I said, "You don't understand. You're not musical. 
You might be fond of music." 

Lomax:  What does music make you feel like ? 

Barry: Just it makes me happy, very happy, and many a time, I'd 
often be thinking of that. 

Lomax: You seem to be somebody who's terribly nervous, intense, 
and worried about something, but I can't figure out what it is. 
You seem very forgetful, you forget things, don't know where you 
leave things, drop things, spill things. What's on your mind ? 

Barry:  I'll tell you. Music. 

Lomax:  I don't think so. 

Barry:  Yes, I know it from my heart. 

Lomax:  Are you very religious ? 

Barry:  No.
