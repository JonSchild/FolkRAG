Reverend Roe.  Reel 10.  P. 5
R: Sure he do. Yessir. Had it not been for myself, why, we wouldn't-a
[have] had this streets gravelled not only this street but some of the
other streets around here. And I just had to go uptown and go before
the white folks and get them to just fix me out a [cl?ock)] and give me
the price of everything, and then I would have to come back here and
collect the money and carry it up there and have it done. And they
don't do just what they promise us they'll do; they promised to keep
this street up, keep gravel on it, you know, but they don't do it.
A: Have you been up to protest about this? [S--l?] What did they say?
R: [Sure] And I mean to go back to them as soon as this spell is over.
A: What did they tell you?
R: [They] Tell me they'll see to it. You know, they'll talk nice to
you, but they don'tdo nothing about it much.
A: Do you think they're more likely to treat a [minister] preacher nice than just
a common Negro citizen?
R: Well, now they pay a deal of attention now more than they have been
because all of the colored people now are paying their poll tax, and
they know when we come up there, we have a pretty good group behind us
and they pay a little more attention to us.
A: Do you think the e's ever gonna be some colored officers elected
from [Gail's] Dallas County?
R: Well, there may be. We may have some colored policemans since they
find that they do a deal of good. I think we will.
A: Do they go after the colored vote here now? Do they go out and
make appeals for the vote?
R: [Well] Oh, they voting now, yessir.
A: [No,] I say do the politicians make an appeal forit?
R: Oh yeah, they come over here to my church here sometimes and speak.
Yessir, they do.
A: What do the people think about them?
