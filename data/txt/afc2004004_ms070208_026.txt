Come, on, nigger, uid de such!
O ---------- no,
Hep' me to make this landin'
"  "  "  "  "  ",
Upon the hill
Roustabout ain't got no home,
Makes his livin' on his shoulder bone,
(3) And you know he works hard, babe

Get on the head -
(3) I wisht [I was] I was Capt. Ringo's son, babe)
stand on the head & see hed run, this mornin'.

3) I went to the landin' & fold up my arms
    (this morning')
Never missed my dough roller till the boat
was gone.
-
We had a man on the boat who had a whip -
hear him down there poppin' the whip -- bow!
bow! bow! - an' a club, too, an' a pistol,
too over their heads +++ ever time you hear it
pop, a man would holler - "Yassuh, cap'n" -
I've seen 'em hids 'em. -
