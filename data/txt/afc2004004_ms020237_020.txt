ha! An' so that's right. It's a, that's a solid cow, by 'isself.
Hu, hu, hu, hu, hu!
I wanna ask ya this one here. Now, I know it's easy; it's 
so easy, it's jus' one tip a word. Jus' one little bit a word.
"Once there was..." I wantcha tell me this, tell me what it is.
"There was three mens walkin' along the road. An', an' a bright,
sunny day. An' one a these mens was blind, stone blind. An'
one a these mens didn't have nary a arm, bof arms had got cut
off. An' un, one of these mens didn't have on no clothes, buck
nekked.  An' the blind man, he seed a dollar. An' the man didn'
have no arm, he picked it up. An' the man didn't have no clo'es
on put it in his pocket." Now that's plain, jus' as easy as
that, that, that's, jus one lil' word, got it...Well, jus' think
of it now; jus' see into it. Three mens; one blind; one didn't
have no arms; and one nekked. Didn't have no clo'es on at all, 
whatsoever. An', an' the man that was blind, he seed this dollar,
a dollar in the road...An' the man didn't have no arms, he picked 
it up. An' the man that didn't have no pocket put in 'is, in
'is, no clothes, put it in his pocket...See? Now, that's just as common
as anything ya ever[laid eyes on] wanna hear...Ya know what that is?
TL: What?
BJ: A lie...Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hu, hu, hu, hu! You, you
                          you                               a long time with that,
wouldn't it? That's all, it's a straight lie. Ha, ha, ha,
ha, hu-ha! Yessir, he couldn't, he couldn't, ha, ha, ha, he
couldn't pick it, it couldn't be done! Ha, ha! Ha, ha!
What is this now? This is real good. Now, I know you've
seen this, now, back up your home, sometime or nother I [have] has,
I know, [in feet] an' I got--I think I have one home, I'm quite...Yeah, I got one on
