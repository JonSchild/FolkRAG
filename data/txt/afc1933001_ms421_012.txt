BROTHER-MAN, MY BROTHER-MAN.
Tune: Maryland, My Maryland.

Our Father God has given man,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.
The where-with-all to build a land,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.
Cooperation is the plan,
It needs the though of every man;
It'll work in everything we do,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.

Man has at hand the power to build,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.
The Rochdale Plan of brother-hood,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.
Where-in each one will share with all
The efforts, of his thoughts and toil,
Cooperation is the Way
Brother-man, My Brother-man.

A new day dawns, with life enriched,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.
We seek the good for all mankind,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.
To each will come abundant life,
We do away with war and strife;
Cooperation is the Way,
Brother-man, My Brother-man.

THE CO-OP WAY
Tune: It Ain't going to rain no mo, no mo.

I won't delay, no mo, no mo,
I won't delay no mo,
For I see the good of the Co-op Way
And I won't delay no mo.

I'll join right up, right up, right up,
I'll join right up, right now.
For I see the good of the Co-op Way
And I'll join right up, right now.

I'll go to work and boost, and boost,
I'll go to work and boost.
For the one true way is the Co-op Way
And I'll go to work and boost.

Let's tell our friends, our friends
our friend,s
Let's tell our friends today.
The benefits that will come to all
When we go the Co-op Way.
C.W.K.
