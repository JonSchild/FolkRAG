Dear Father:
I am now dictating all of my correspondence to my brand-new
secretary, and you can blame her for all mistakes in
diction, grammar, etc. My work here was piling up to such
mountainous heights that I barged in and asked God for
some help and in a week I had it. I feel very much relieved
about the whole situation here in the Archive.

Last week the Reverend Herzog descended from the academic
heights of Columbia to finally inspect the Archive for the
Foundations, who at long last have heard of my little request

us more money than we asked for. Everybody, including
Putnam, is now agreed that Charley is essential to the development
of the Archive and he may be my boss by the time
I next write you.

I am completely free now to work on Ballads No. 2 and I 
hope that before I go on my next recording trip I will
have all of the texts finally and forever done and will
be well along in the job of writing the head notes, so 
don't bother your head about the book any more for the
moment. 

In reply to your questions - No. 1: I do not know why

he was as friendly as anybody could be, and I would guess
that he merely wanted to avoid any sort of unpleasant controversy
with a person of whom he is as fond as he is of
you. I have no doubt that Herzog was largely responsible 
for killing your projects at the Yale meeting. When he
was here he confessed that although, of course, he felt no
