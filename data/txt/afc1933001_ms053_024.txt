The Song of the Fiddler Crabs
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three,
The papa, the mamma, the little ba-bee;
We live in the sand at the edge of the sea-
Pollyp and Pillyp and little Peejee.
What do we do when the waves run high?
What do we do when the sea-birds cry?
What do we do when the wind blows strong?
We cuddle together and sing our song:
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three.
The papa, the mamma, the little ba-bee;
We live in the sand at the edge of the sea,
The very best home for the fiddlers three.
Way down deep in the sandman's home,
Safe from the breakers and hissing foam,
We tuck our fiddles down under our chins,
And there in the darkness the music begins:
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three.
The papa, the mamma, the little ba-bee;
We live in the sand at the edge of the sea,
The very best home for the fiddlers three.
When the sea grows calm and the winds blow sweet,
When the sand is warm to our tripping feet,
With fiddles in hand and bows held tight,
We fiddle and dance in the pale moonlight:
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three.
The papa, the mamma, the little ba-bee;
There are no crabs so happy as we -
Pollyp and Pillyp and little Peejee.
