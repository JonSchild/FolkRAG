Comanche, Texas.
January 9, 1934.

Mr. David H. Stevens,
The Rockefeller Foundation,
49 West 49th St.,
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Me, Stevens:

I apologize to you for my bad spelling. As
a matter of fact, I am a good speller, having
learned the art through practice in many [*”*]spelling
bees[*”*] on the frontiers of Texas.

The work of equipping my automobile is going
forward and, as I write your formerly, I will
furnish you receipted bills for all the expenses
incurred. I am in receipted bills for all the expenses
incurred. I am in receipt of information from Mr,
Herbert Putnam that The Rockefeller Foundation has
notified him that they will make $3,000.00 available
for the expenses of myself and son through a year of
travel in the South. They limit the grant to one
year. As I told you, I made my request for a total
of $200.00 a month. Mr. Putnam seems concerned about
the possibility of some complications arising in
this matter by The Rockefeller Foundation and The
Carnegie Corporation; he, (Mr.Putnam) not seeming
to understand that I informed you of my application
to The Carnegie Corporation and of my having also
notified Mr.Leland of this fact. I wish, if you can
spare the time, you would get the matter straightened
out by means which undoubtedly suggest themselves to
you, notifying Me. Leland, Mr. Putnam and also Mr.
Carl Engel.

I have just written Mr. Putnam that, if necessary,
I would come on to Washington and New York in case my
presence was needed to clear up any doubtful points.
I must add, however, that I would greatly regret losing
the time and spending the money unless you thought
the trip would have some important bearing on the issue
involved.

Sincerely yours

JOHN A. LOXMA
