Tom's brother, the pharmist 
and Jack his pal, went back to 
get his kid brother. As Tom's 
brother carried him, Jack threw 
the grenade at the nest of Jap 
machine guns.

When the doctor finally came 
out to tell Tom's condition, he 
said that the only thing that 
saved Tom's life was the blood 
plasma donated by the people in 
the States

I hope this story will 
make more people (realize) avant 
to give blood donations which 
will save the lives of ther 
boys.
