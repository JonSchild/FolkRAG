Dear Mr. Strunk:
Here on your signatures I have no time to write out in the field I have come to dread sending our Records by mail or express. They are easily spoiled. Alan and I will probably spend January in Washington (bringing the Records there) putting them into final shape for your files.

Thanks for your good help with the circular.

Sincerely,
John A. Lomax

of course, I intended the [?] to come in from Washington.
