Alan, amigo;
Rambling down
Beale St. last evening I came
upon the customary knot[s]
of shuffling, chanting negroes
surrounding a better than average
box-picker. This was the
favorite of the crowd. This
was the "last" copy he had that
I bought, but mysteriously later
on 3 more were produced.

Pimps, weed[i]-smokers,
prize-fighters, gamblers
were among the varied types
encountered.
John
P.S. The tune was pretty fair and
none that I could recognize.
