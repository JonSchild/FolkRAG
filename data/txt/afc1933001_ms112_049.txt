Dear Alan,
We have enjoyed very much your and Bess's letter this spring and summer.  I'm sure the time passes more swiftly for you young folks. It isn't suppose to be so; but I am inclined to think that after oldsters retire from a life run on schedule, even if that schedule is self-made, and take up an unscheduled more leisureful life, time then begins to move more slowly.  I think that is why your father and I notice the passage of time between letters.  And I attribute his feeling better, at least to some extent to the interchange of information the he has had from you and Bess this past six weeks.  And I am particularly glad that you plan to come home for a week; wish it could be while Shirley is here, but we can't have evrrything. I suppose she and Patsy won't get back here until the first week in September.  Poor Shirly.  last Friday when she wrote she was still waiting; she had given up hop of seeing Christ in C., but before she finished the letter she said she had information that sounded more encouraging.  She has to be in Chicago on July 1 and must come by here to assemble her and Patsy's belongings and leave Susan.
Johnny writes that he and Margaret expect to be up this weekend.  Margaret has been ill and is improving rapidly now.  Your father sent you Johnny's letter, I believe.  I am glad he has decided what to do, and hope he has made a happy decision.  He will probably enjoy this more than routine office work, for which several people had urged him to apply.  What are you prospects for service these days.  Dow the reorganization under Elmer Davis affect your plans?
The check list is interesting and will prove very helpful, I'm sure; of course errors will crop up, most of them, I imagine, through indefinite worthwhile to make note in the margin of error that your father and I may detect? I am a bit concerned about your father's trip.  A month ago he couldn't have started out, but for the past three weeks he has felt 100% better.  Of course he will need help and a companion, and I can't go this time on account of Susan.  Anyway I think it would be very well for him to have a  male companion.  That's another objection to his living a "retired" existence: all his men friends in Dallas are somewhat younger than he is and still going to please of business during the day.  Once in a while he gets the notion, as you know, that they have forgot him.  All, that haven't, of course, and are sweet and thoughtful of him; but their business calls for immediate attention, and his, also, can be postponed for a day--(and thereby suffers.)  In the winter he has his Town and Gown Club twice a month, and other sorts of get-togethers..Well, my point is that I think he would enjoy the companionship of some yong fellow on this trip, preferably one who has to not already hear his favorite stories; Now, me, I never grow tired of hearing them, but he thinks I do.  I hope Mr. Dobie will be able to direct some student to him.  Somehow your father doesn't have much confidence in Mr. Brook (s?).
