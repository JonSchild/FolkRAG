July 17- South from Memphis we found
Son House at Robinsonville, - handsome
and sensitive man. We went with him
to see Robert Johnson's mother. She
told us of her son, spoke of God, her
great master; got happy as we left - 
prophysying in the dusty yard. Later
we recorded Son House's magnificent
deep song - his blues  - about as fine
and impassioned as I've heard. Had
a run-in with the manager of the plantation 
Son rents on. He was extremely
insulting and hostile. Finally after
the recordings were over I drove
to Tunica with him and we went
to the Deputy Sherrif's office
and had an hour's debate - all
the attitudes. Will have to discussed
in another place. Clarksdale that night
July 18 - Spent this day until 3 getting
my affairs straight with the law. Interview
with W. C. Anderson, young businessman.
Session extraordinary with his overseers who 
refused flatly to let me on their places.
"Pres. Roosevelt couldn't come on our
place." Checkers had been operating
