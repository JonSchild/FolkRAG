Reel 7, Song 8

I GOT TO LAY IN THAT OLD, COLD GRAVEYARD
Lawd, I got to lay
In the old, cold graveyard,
Yes, I got to lay
There for myself,
Lawdy, nobody here
Can lay there for me,
Lawdy, I got to lay
There for myself.

Lawd, I got to press
My dyin' pillow, etc.
 
Lawd, I got to stand
My trial at the judgment, etc.

Lawd, I got to cross
The cold river of Jerden, etc.
