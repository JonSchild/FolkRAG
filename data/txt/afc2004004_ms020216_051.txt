BJ TAPE 3, p. 48

I don' know what they do, but that person soon comes all right.
Jus' goes like everybody else.
AL:     You go and tell your friendly white people and they go and...?
BJ:      I mean, if it, if it, if one would do me that way.   I heard
it done, yeah.   They ain' no, ain' no, ain' none of 'em gonna
bother me.
          They's a lady that came from Cuspeth, Georgia an' she, ah,
came over for me to work for 'er.   An' I had so many points workin'
then that I didn't get a chance to work for 'er.   An' so Frankie
(BJ's daughter-in-law) went an' worked for 'er.   So she was mad
with her husban' one day an' ah she came in home an', an' -- yes,
she was pittin' for me to work for 'er when Miss ah Waters leave;
I work for Miss Waters then -- an' she was really lookin' for
me to work for 'er, you know, when, when Waters leave.   Frankie
was jus' holdin' the job then, 'till then.   So, an' ah that was, ah,
you know, the trade.   That was the deal.
         So, this day, ah Frankie called me, I said, "What you reckon..."
         "I'm ah, I, I'm feelin'...I'm goin' home."
         I said, "Goin' home?"   I said, "What you mean?"
         She said, "I been gone" she said, "This woman talk to me like I was a
chile."
         I said, "What she done?"   She seemed to be such a won'erful
lil' woman.   She had three lil' chirrun, cute lil' things.
         An' so, she said, "I jus' got her told."   Said, "I'm goin'
on home."   Said, "An' you, you can come on to take the job when
you get ready."
         An' so I said, "Well, tell me what she said."
         [She] "I'll tell ya when I get home."
         I said, "Where's she at?"
