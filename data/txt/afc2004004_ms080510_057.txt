have him singing one of these unaccompanied
ballads, the story of an adulterous wife
who falls in love with a little page boy
named Musgrave  ,  no,  yes,  falls in love
with a courtier names Musgrave and a little
page boy runs to tell Lord Barnet,  hanky
panky uis going on in the palace and Nimrod
tells it with gestures,  how the little
pageboy swims through the river to get to
Lord barnet and then Lord Barnet  mounts his
troopo and sounds his horns when he comes
close to the castle where the adulterous 
scene is going forward and lovers wake and
they hear  the horns and the lover is
worried but the lady said "It is just the
shepherd's whining for the sheep"  She is
not interested in any interference at that
moment.  They go to sleep and end up with
Lord Barnet standing at the bedfeet.

[*05  :15 :57: 01*]
Here the ballad splits,  sometimes its Lord 
barnet who bites the dust and sometimes its
Musgrave and sometimes they kill each other
in a fight with bare broadswords. 

In this one it is little Musgrave who
triumphs and it is rather surprising
considering what a good presbyterian we 
have here singing this song.
