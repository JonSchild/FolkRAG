-14- Rumors, 8-3 to 8-8  New York 8 - 14 - 42

Staten Island 8 - 7 (Prosperous housewife): "My son in the Army is
living in a fine hotel, eating the best of food, and having an easy time of it.
Is it any wonder our taxes are so high?  When he comes back we'll have a hard
time pleasing him."

New York 8 - 6 (War plant engineer): "We're not worrying over any
bombings.  We didn't take out War Damage insurance until we were forced to by
our bankers.  Hell, there isn't a chance of a raid here.  Our anti-aircraft
equipment is the best in the world, don't let anyone tell you any other story."

Staten Island 8 - 6 (Woman, librarian):  "With the Nazis overpowering 
the world, there isn't any future left for us women, unless we win this war,
and we're losing.  I'm discouraged."
