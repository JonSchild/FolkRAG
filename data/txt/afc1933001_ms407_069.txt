Ballad of a Ballad-Singer

And soon enough up to Yankeeland
The Lomax car is whirled,
and Yale and Harvard hear "the famousest
Guitar-player in the world!"
And Lead Belly's own songs they heed,
Like one of "Bill Martin and Ella Speed."

Just as folks gather Southern grapes,
Muscadines, scuppernongs - 
So, for the Carnegie Corporation,
John Lomax gathered songs;
But in swampland Lead Belly he can scan
A whole book of ballads all in one man!

So here's to John A. Lomax
And to Orpheus his peer, 
With a voice that makes brown ladies swoon,
And a scar from ear to ear;
And, I hope for Lead Belly's sake, a charm
That will protect him from all harm!

For once in an age a minstrel 
Like Lead Belly doth arise,
And then it's good to hear him singing
The stars right out of the skies
With his own "Bill Martin - long and slender - 
Better known by bein' a bartender!"

- William Rose Benet.
