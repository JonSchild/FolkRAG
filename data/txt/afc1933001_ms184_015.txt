with one of the best, most active and most difficult
collectors in the U.S. Since I have been here, I have
worked out a couple of tentative plans for work in Nova
Scotia and Detroit, which involve for us only the loan of
a recording machine. The Nova Scotia woman is Miss Helen
Creighton whose work in that field is distinguished and
has been asked by John Marshall to submit an application
for a grant. The other is with Miss Thelma James, successor 
to Emelyn Gardner at Wayne University in Detroit. They
have what seems to be the most active collecting center
in the country with 10 or 12 graduate students working
on all sorts of problems in the foreign minority field
in Detroit. I have taught these folks how to work
the recording machine and have spent a lot of time with
them working out details about collecting. Another whole
day I devoted to work on the machine which got slightly
damaged in transit, and I must have spent at least a day
now answering correspondence. I hope that you can get Mr.
Rogers or whoever is responsible to change his verdict 
about taking away my annual leave on this occasion. I feel
I have never done a piece of work for the Archive than to
spend two weeks with my colleagues at this Institute.

I am sorry not to have gotten a note to you
sooner, but I have been giving two lectures a day for the 
past few days, and things have been quite hectic. My
kindest regards to you and Caroline, to Mary, Ed and Dick,
Miss Geware, and to my other colleagues.
