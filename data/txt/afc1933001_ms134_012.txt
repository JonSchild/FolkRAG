Dear Dr. Putnam:

A year or two ago I had the ambition to try and sketch for
British listeners, in a series of broadcasts to be given in London, a 
history of the United States through its songs. This spring the
British Broadcasting Corporation asked me to prepare this series for
the summer schedule, and I hope to present it in London during July,
August and September. I sketched out the programs, found and listed
the songs I needed, and have made a small collection of commercial 
phonograph records. I found it, however, increasingly difficult to
get what I wanted on commercial records, either because the records
have been withdrawn and the matrices destroyed, or more commonly because 
the regular companies never seem to have heard of American folk
song. I saw my series vanishing into thin air, and so last week came
down to Washington to ask the help and favor of Mr. Alan Lomax, which
he unsparingly gave to me. 

I found that the Library, and only the Library, has recorded a 
score or more of the songs which can make my series possible. I spoke
with both Dr. Spivak and Mr. Lomax and they were both very interested
and appreciative of what I intend to do. On three consecutive days
Mr. Lomax and I went through the archives and found what resources he
was willing to have me draw on. With Dr. Spivak and Mr. Lomax I then
discussed the practical problem, that is of having the Library's permission 
to make copies of these records for my purpose. I understand
that these records have not before been available to outsiders, though
doubtless in time they can be made so and legally protected in the
normal way that artists, universities, broadcasting companies put out
private records for retail sale. 

This letter is to ask the favor of your permission to draw on the
Library in this way. I acutely appreciate the trust that such permission 
would put on the British Broadcasting Corporation, and me in
particular, but I would have every intention of honoring it. And I
have this proposal to facilitate the process if you should grant us
your permission.
