Music:  Tuning fiddle

MacPherson:  Brothers, the lairds who have put this
                        hempen collar around my neck hope to
                        kill the spirit of James MacPherson.

Music:  Sweeps bow over the strings.

Macpherson:  But they will only make me immortal.
                        You see, it is [they who ?] not I
                        who fear them, but the Lairds who fear
                        me - [illegible] unarmed and bound as I am.
                        They fear me because I am a free man, because
                        I will acknowledge [that] no man is
                        better than [thyself] myself, [because I think it]
                        believing it is hateful for ?] the laird to
                        sup in a palace & his bowman to starve
                        in a hovel. And now the Laird of
                        Grant that Highland Saint who has
                        turned widows into the road to beg -
Crowd reaction - 
                        fears me [?] with [only] only my fiddle in my
                        hand. Well be may. The Laird [He] can only [own poss things] grasp and possess - while
                        I I can [make them out of thin] create out of thin air
                        and cat-gut [?] a thing that will
                        keep my name [alive in [?] glory] glorious and
                        his [in infamy] infamous. [for good and all ... when his castle has crumbled to dust]
