A relative of mine came home 
on leave one day and here is the 
story he told:

A sargent was standing on the 
drill field addressing a company of men. 
He said, "I want all college men to 
stand on the right, the ones that 
went to high school on the left and 
the ones that didn't go to school 
to stand in the center." Of course some 
of the men went to the side of the 
college men thinking they would get 
the easiest work. Knowing this, 
the sargent said, "You college men 
sweep up the grounds, you high 
school fellows pick up after them 
and you fellows that didn't go 
to school watch them and see 
how it's done.
