RUMORS IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN

Reported by Bert M. Grim

At a dedication of the Leader Dog League sponsored
by the Lions Club a man stated that the small 
business men were being crucified by big business, 
politicians and the Jewish capitalists who are in 
important positions on war jobs. He said he knew of
three concerns who went to Washington for priorities
on war work with no success until they got a connection 
thru a Jewish personnel man who held the
whip hand. This discussion grew quite positive 
that this was one of the reasons why we were not
getting more production from the small independent concerns.

His claim that the all too important personnel in 
Washington as well as the local plants here were 
breaking down the morale of the men who could and
wanted to do a good job in our war effort.

This man is a long resident of Detroit and seems
to be very well educated and highly respected.
Approximately 50 years old.
