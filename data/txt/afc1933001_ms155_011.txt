collected practically all the songs that
I consider have particular interest
in either words or music, and
they cover pretty much the whole
range of life - low-life, that is -
in the West Indies. Owing to the
fact that they are double records,
I have had to include some of
no special importance; but I will
list those, so that you can easily
pick out the good ones.

I'm longing to hear Capt. Dick's
records! he and I are performing
for the Girl Marines' "skippers",
down at the Harbor on April 13.

Sincerely yours,
Joanna C. Colcord
