WOMEN WORKERS

(Tune: "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
Page 166 - Old Favorite Songs.)


The Summer Students gather from the busy city street,
The call resounds through country towns, as women workers meet,
The doors are open, open wide, we hear the eager feet
At all the Summer Schools.

Refrain: Study is a preparation,
Workers' schools throughout the nation
Singing workers' education,
Shall waken industry.

Oh, women workers, in your hands you hold a shining tool,
A chance for education at a workers' Summer School
Keep sharp and strong your tool for work, there is no magic rule,
As understanding grows.

Refrain: Study is a preparation,
Workers' schools throughout the nation
Singing workers' education,
Shall waken industry

Of industry we are a part, and we as workers try,
In problems of the every day new knowledge to apply,
With all our fellow workers we will hold the standards high
In industry and School.

Refrain: Study is a preparation,
Workers' schools throughout the nation
Singing workers' education,
Shall waken industry.
