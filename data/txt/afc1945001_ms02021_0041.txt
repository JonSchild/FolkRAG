REPORT ON RUMORS

Both drafted and enlisted young soldiers in the army who have been transferred to Denver from other points in the United States have complained regarding the treatment received as far as transportation facilities were concerned. Many of them make the statement that they are packed into over-crowded trains and that they had to sleep on the floors of the railroad cars while enroute or stand up for long periods. While the soldiers themselves seem to feel that this is perhaps part of the hardship they must endure in the armed forces, the public generally are resentful because the Government does not give more consideration to the comfort of the men.
********
We continue to hear the rumor and complaint that many are unable to understand why draft boards call into the service of the armed forces many whom they feel should be deferred while other young men, both single and married, are not called. Some of these young men themselves seem surprised that they have not yet been inducted
