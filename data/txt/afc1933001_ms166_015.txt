I feel it highly advisable that the cases in which the Archive 
records are kept be made locked cases, since the materials are 
more easily subject to damage and also more vulnerable in certain
respects than materials in ordinary shelves.  To this end, may 
I suggest that wire grating be placed back of the case in which 
the Archive records are now placed and that a door be installed 
for that case and another one for the next case adjoining?
