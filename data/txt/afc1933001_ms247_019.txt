Dear Alan: I wish you would 
invite Mr. Leland up sometimes
and play him the program "Old Chisholm 
Trail" and perhaps, if he likes 
it, one of the Negro programs. I 
am pleased at his good opinion 
of our work, though I have had
to write him that I could 
not print such flattery in my 
adventures.
Again we are having a 
lot of trouble with the machine
It gets out of fix overnight while
sitting still.  I have come to the 
belief that the trouble is due to the 
lower quality and different hardnesses
of the new records.  But don't worry,
I'll get along.  Lovingly,
Father
[*I wrote to Mr. Leland to get his early impressions of us for 
possible inclusion in my book.  I remember how nervous 
you were at the interview in [D??k's] office. You can 
share the letter to whom you like.  I have kept a copy.*]
