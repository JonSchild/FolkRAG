of people's knowledge and understanding of different
phases of the war program -- and the general domestic
scene[s]. A systematic study should lead to a better
understanding of the results of present programs and
the possible need for extensions of programs.

On the basis of the experience in this study, it is suggested
that a systematic rumor study could be developed within the framework of
the Bureau somewhat as follows:
1. Rumors could be collected by field staffs under the
guidance of Special Services Division. There could
be the study of (a) any rumor, and (b) study of special
lists of rumors which may be prepared; for example,
rumors based on Enemy Sources analyses.
2. Rumor content could then be analyzed by Special Services
Division in terms of content theme, geographic dispersion,
frequency of occurrence, implications for the war
effort, and emotional tone.
3. Rumor themes and typical illustrations could be referred
to Sources Division and Media Division for analysis.
They could be referred to the most appropriate divisions
for evaluation of validity. There could be special Media
analyses. There might be Sources analyses as follows:

U.S. Government Sources Analysis

U.S. Government sources (including the Congressional
Record) can be profitably utilized in rumor study,
after the analysis of rumor content, to relate government
information output to rumor. These factors may
be noted and analyzed:
a. Sources which may give rise to rumors or
help circulate already existing rumors.
b. Sources which tend to remove a rumor or
the raison d'etre of a rumor. Factors involved
here are (1) factual and policy content
of official statements and (2) the
informational character of the source. The
discrepancy between the phraseology of a
rumor and the phraseology of official information
may suggest corrective information.
c. Sources acknowledging the existence of a
rumor and explicitly confirming or denying
it.
d. General comparisons between what is on the
public mind as indicated in the rumors and
what official spokesmen are saying. This
