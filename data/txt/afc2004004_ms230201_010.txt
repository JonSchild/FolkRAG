Here [Memphis] the Birmingham Kid asks a question out of his real interest
in the tools of levee camp worker.  He and Old Natchez have both
done such work and so they enjoy talking about the tools of
their trade--- the various types of plows and scoops with which
they have formed and moulded the Southern earth. 

The Kid:  
Natchez. do you know what a gee-whiz is?

Natchez:
(With great enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah,---a gee-whiz is a thing you
cultivate cotton with--Same as an off-bar-- to cut [off] the ridge
down small so that when the people chop cotton, they ain't 
got so much grass to chop. 
 
The Kid:  
Well, what about the middle-buster?

Natchez:  
Well, that's the thing you use after the gee-whiz an' throw
the stuff in the middle; then the middle-buster comes down an'
bust-es that middle out an' throws it back up...

The Kid:  
Yeah, but you use the turnin' plow before you do the middle
buster. 

Natchez:  
Yeah, that's in the time after the crop is gathered.  Then they
break up the land.  They got the turnin' plow to go along an' cuts
off half the row on one side, then come back and on the 
other side an' cuts the other half off, then the middle buster
goes down an' takes that middle out.
