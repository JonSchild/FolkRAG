four majors marched together -
at the head of the band, Thomar
danced along crouching yellow
shirt calling the band over his shoulder
the president at his side the two 
coronels with their whips behind
the four majors their batons
flashing in the sun behind them the
vaxines and behind them the mob
singing and dancing [the] clouds of 
dust rising up from beneath their feet.
