Miss Martina McDonald                            -3-                         December 5, 1938

As to fruit-raising songs from the North West, I know of none,
although some doubtless do exist. Mining- The Dreary Black Hills,
The Days of '49, perhaps. The same lumberjack and cowboy songs are
pretty much the same all over, but if you are interested in a specifically
North Western flavor, you can find it in Powder River Jack
and Kitty Lee's Cowboy Song Book, McKee Printing Co., Butte, Montana,
1934.

If you are interested in play-party songs, a mine of information
is to be found in B. A. Botkin's "The Play Party in Oklahoma.

Sincerely yours,
