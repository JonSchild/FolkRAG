Black Legion to WPA Girl
(Tune--"Goodnight Sweetheart")

Hood night, Sweetheat,
Looks as if the Legion
Wants you sent to
Quite another region,

You'll shoot out on up into space;
Pieces of you all over the place

So we'll say
Hoodnight, sweetheart,
As the fuse is lighted
Soon now, sweetheart, you'll be dynamited, 
pretty faces will be going places
Hood night, sweetheart, Hoodnight!

SONG OF THE BLACK LEGION
(TUNE "GOODY GOODY"
Oh, you've met some punks and
 You've met some [Hee ls] awful heels
HOODY, HOODY
And you've met some skunks
And now you know how it feels
HOODY HOODY
But of all you've met we durst
To claim that we're the worst
We're a hundred percent Americans
Psls of Willie Hearst

We ride around the country side at night
HOODY, HOODY
With  whips and guns and sticks of dynamite
Hurray and Hallelujah
Here's what we promised to Yah!
HOODY HOODY  on us.
HOODY HOODY on you
And death to Negroes, Catholics, Reds and Jews.
