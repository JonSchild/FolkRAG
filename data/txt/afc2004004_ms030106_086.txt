[82]
1652 B
Long time people thought I wrote this tune.  I used to
sell them just a little bit of lead copies for thirty-five cents.
I kept my sheet music so nobody could see it.

If I was whiskey and you was a duck,
I'd dive to the bottom and I'd never come up,
Oh, how long do I have to wait?
Can I get it now, do I have to hesitate?

If I had a woman, she was tall,
She'd make me think about my parasol,
Oh, how long do I have to wait?
Can I get it now, do I have to hesitate?

An old lady by the name of Jane,
I hit her, knocked her right off her cane.

Mama, mama, look at Sis,
She's out on the [levee?] doin' double twist

She says "Come in here, you dirty little sow,
You trying to be a bad girl [&] don't know how."

She said, "Touch my bonnet, touch my shawl,
But do not touch my waterfall."

There's a girt, sittin' on the stump.
(a dirty verse, he says)
