A
Delores Rossi English I Period 7
M. F. Mardorf 104 March 12, 1943
A rumor that I happened to hear
was: Hitler is dead I don't
believe it though because it
would have been confirmed and
probably would have been in all
the newspapers.
A joke I happened to hear was
She - do you know who Uncle
Sam married?
He - No who?
She - Aunty Aircraft.
A joke I heard went something
like this: Whats a buck private?
a drip caught in the draft.
It is being said that the
navy is going to give Japan
half of the ocean, the bottom
half.
