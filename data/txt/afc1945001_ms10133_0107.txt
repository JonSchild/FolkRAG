Soph. N. F.

(1) Gather scrap and slap a Jap.

(2) Negroes join the Marines and be mess boys.

(3) Buy bonds and never get it back.

(4) Never will I be a W.A.A.C.
The true reason is a fact
That Negro women who,
Join the W.A.A.C.'s
Are segregated on every hand
And when on duty they serve
It's in the kitchen on a sack
Peeling potatoes like a good W.A.A.C.

(5) saps are usually Japs.
