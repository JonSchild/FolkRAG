C:KM       June 14, 1939

My dear Mr. Brock:

I have received, in the absence of Dr. Putnam, the Librarian,
your letter of June 12, informing him that the American
Council of Learned Societies through its Committee on Research
on Teaching Personnel has made a grant of $500 to Mr.
Alan Lomax, Assistant-in-charge of the Archive of American
Folk-Song, for the study of anthropological and linguistic
methods of musicology research at Columbia University in
1939-40.

The Library will be glad to accept this grant and willingly
administer it for the purpose indicated. The entire sum
may be transferred as soon as convenient.

Very sincerely yours, 

Chief Assistant Librarian

Mr. Wallace D. Brock, Bursar
American Council of Learned Societies
907 Fifteenth Street, N. W.
Washington, D. C.
