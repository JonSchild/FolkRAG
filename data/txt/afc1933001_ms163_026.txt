Office of the President

November eighteenth
1940

My dear Mr. Lomax:
One of my scripts for NEW HORIZONS 
of Columbia's School of the Air of the Americas 
will deal with the rise and fall of the cavalcade 
on the cattle trails, especially the Chisholm Trail.

In that connection, I am gunning for 
a typical Texas "long horn lullaby", the kind of 
song the cow men would sing on their night shift 
when riding around a bunch of cattle on the trail.

I wonder if you would be able to 
suggest a typical night herding song, and tell me 
where I might find both the words and music score. 

Thanking you for your cooperation in 
this matter, I am

Sincerely yours, 
Hans Christian Adamson
Assistant to the President
