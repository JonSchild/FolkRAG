BJ TAPE 21, p. 13

     I say, "I don' know," I say, "I'll git 'im out when I git
his eye, git 'im to look this way. I'll call 'im." An' so.
I say to myse'f, "Let him stay there, 'cause Will knows what he's
talkin' about." I can see he knows. He ain't comin' out for me
or nobody else. He gonna stay right there.
     Ah' so. He figure an' figure. He say -- Heh! He went right
along with 'im. He say, "You figure that. Now you come on right;
come right on down wit' me. Now, come on out. Come on down wit'
me." Jus' like that talkin'! Oh, that guy! He said, "Now,
I ain't got a dollar." (??)
     He said, "Well, I don't see how in the world I made that
mistake, Red." He called 'im "Red;" he liked him. He was a
hard-workin' guy, you know. He really liketed 'im. An' so, he
says, ah, "I jus' don't see it..."
     Says ah, "You can't see now, but you see then. Jus' a while
ago, you see it like hell. But you...! You ain't seein' now!"
     That scared them guys again! You know!
     "Ya see it like hell, but ya cain't see it now." Huh, huh!
He said, "You can see it now."
     Said, "All right." So he, he paid it to 'im. Went on. An'
nothin', nothin' to it, ya know, not at all. So some of the
peoples be talkin' about it aroun' there. Talkin' -- sumpin'
about Will, about Bill, ah, about Will, around there one day.
So, anyhow, Mr. Umford said, "Don't pay no 'tention to Red Boy."
     Ya never hear him [tell of] tellin' Red Boy ta hurry or to go to diffrunt
places or just why he didn't get sech-an'-sech a piece out
 or nothin', ain't nothin', never.
     Mr. Umfort walked up to a field one day -- he told Mama an'
them about it -- say he never see nothin' to beat it in his life.
