RUMORS IN NORTH CAROLINA

During a survey of the central part of this State the following rumors came
to my attention:

1.  What rumors people are telling:

Winston-Salem, North Carolina    August 3, 1942

In talking with a party she stated that in her opinion the gasoline rationing on the
East Coast was put into effect to help fight the submarine menace on the coast and
thereby prevent individuals and gasoline station operators from supplying submarines
on the East Coast with gas, oil and other supplies that they need.  This
rumor is not widespread because I only heard it once and the statement was made by
a person who is broad minded and has good character in the locality in which she
lives.  In my opinion this rumor has a good effect on the morale of the people
because it would have a tendency to show the people a good reason why the gasoline
rationing was put into effect.

Winston-Salem, North Carolina    Aug 3, 1942

In talking with a fellow he stated that he had heard that a gasoline distributor
was caught in the swamps of Georgia supplying a submarine with gasoline.  That at
the time the operator was caught he was in the act of pumping gasoline to the
submarine and that the operator of the gasoline supply truck and the submarine
were captured.  This statement was made by a man who travels a great deal and a
person in my opinion who is very intelligent and would do anything he could to
help the war effort.
