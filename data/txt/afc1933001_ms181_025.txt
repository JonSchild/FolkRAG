Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The Progressive Education Association Service Center
pamphlet which you and Mrs. Cowell compiled came
several weeks ago.  I am delighted with it and so pleased
that it is available right at this time. Not only
schools but public libraries will welcome it.

Very truly yours,

Mildred L. Batchelder, Chief
The School and Children's 
Library Division
