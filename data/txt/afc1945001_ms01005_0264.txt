Subject:     Christmas Gifts for Soldiers

                                Good news for all Is the announcement that arrangements
                    have been worked out by the State Department and Army and Navy
                    officials on the one hand, and foreign governments on the other,
                    so that Christmas gifts for American soldiers stationed in foreign
                    lands will be admitted duty free. There are a few remote exceptions
                    such as Egypt where arrangements have not yet been completed, but it
                    is expected that they will be shortly.

                                 Isn't this the sort of thing that makes a good OWI release?
