Dear Mr. Strunk:
By express I have had shipped 
to you 140 double faced records each containing
from two to six tunes of Folk 
Songs [or tunes], or first cousins to folk 
tunes. Alan kept 20 for a short time 
for further notes and I have several
partially filled ones along with me.
I have information that Florida
may prove a rich and interesting 
field.
My next address will be 
Raiford, Fla.
Sincerely, 
JohnA. Lomax
