history of it.  I tol' them about it?  An' they got it from
somewhere.  When you git down there, maybe they can tell ya
where they got it from.  They searched somewhere.   'Cause they
must-musta didn't believe it.  An' they said, "Bessie, [it] that sure
was true."  It happened. . .
         This, this, ah, colored woman, she was tendin' to it at the
fireplace.  That stayed there, an' tend to it at the fireplace.
An' so, ah, they was askin' her questions, what must they do
about this baby.  My -- before then, let me tell ya this:  My
mother was washing.  Had the big, ol' wooden tubs in there, an'
the little lard tubs.  She was washin' 'round the house there.
An' the peoples come up there -- there was a man come up there,
colored man, he come up there.  An' he told 'em, said, "You know,"
said, "Sumpin' happened in Herod today."  You know, had happened
that morning, early.  An' so they asked him, they said, "What
was it?"
         So, so he tol' 'em Mr. (Dr.) Harris's, ah, ah, you know,
wife, had had the devil. . .So, so, they kep' on an' kep' on;
had the devil from hell there.  An' jis' drivin', tellin' peoples.
An' he said he didn' care who see it, Mr. (Dr.) Harris didn't.
'Cause he said, "Soon as her month's up, I'm gonna sen' 'er home."
You know, in those days the women stayed in a month, ya know?
Said, "As soon. . .I'm gonna send her home."  He didn't want her
no more in his house.  Brother, he, he, he, he didn't!  He sent
her away from there!  An' so but anyhow, before this happened, he, ar. . .
She was too sinful; that was a straight-out devil, herself.  I
don't blame him, not one bit.  Hah, no, no!  That's true.
         But, Mama an' them, they all, they stopped they washin' an'
went down there.  Well, I wasn't to Miz [Leda] Liela, ah, at that day.
