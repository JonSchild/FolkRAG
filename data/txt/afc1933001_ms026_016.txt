Dear Mr. Putnam:

You may send my first 
check here. I hope it will be
 satisfactory to you to send the
 amount for half year at this time, 
$2250.00. The work we have done
here is a study and transcription
 growing out of the work of last 
year; besides we have made records
 of approximately a hundred new 
songs which will go into the archive.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax

[*APR 2 1935*]

We finish our work here this week. Then south for
 more collecting. Professor Herzog of Yale is doing the
 music from our study of "[Fred Buddy and His Boys????????]."
