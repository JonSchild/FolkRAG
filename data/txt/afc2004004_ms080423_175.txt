He's blind nearly now, he'd start shooting me now!
AL:  Black snakes will get in and get after the baby's food,
won't they?
Ray:  Well, let me tell you one of mine of a black snake.  When I was
a boy here, with dad and mother, I had to drive the cows off
the mountain.  Right in next to my great uncle's land here,
they growed this (unint.).  I come down there and there sit the
pertiest grown rabbit, bunny rabbit, boy oh boy he was slick!
I just reached down and picked it up and come on with it in my
(unint.).  Tickled to death, come in there and told mother that
I've got me a rabbit!  Dad, he was out somewhere, and he come in
direct and she says "Nathan, Ray here, this boy has got a
grown rabbit and how do you think he caught that?"  He said,
"Hell, there's a black snake close."  He took me back up there
to show where I got.  There was a black snake there, it had
the rabbit charmed, that's the reason it let me take it up!
Hattie:  Yeah, he couldn't go. . .
Ray:  Had it charmed, we goin' ta swallow it.  They can swallow
a  grown rabbit.
Hattie:  They can charm a bird. . .
Ray:  Now another time on up in the years right here on B. .Road of
my great uncle's.  They call it rhododendrum anymore they do,
but we call it laurel lee.  I was going up . . .and the robins . . .
they'd come in to holler for help one another you know but they
can't fight a black snake.  They were just comin' in and goin'
in around down there.  So I looked, and there was a robin up
here this way, goin' around in a big circle.  I got my eyes on
it, and everytime it gone around it draw in a little.  And
