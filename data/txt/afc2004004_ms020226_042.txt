way, see? An' right over there was sit some mo' colored people's
houses an'...the Wileys. They was very intelligent peoples. They,
they was lookin' at all of it. I was standin' in the door. She
wanted to back off, ya know if I come out the do' so she...those
peoples could see me, ya know. She knew I didn't b'long there,
ya know, an' I didn't...I, I was jus' a hired hand around there,
ya see. An' she know she'd been there; she worked for 'em all
right in that neighborhood. She [WANNA] wan'ed make a big thing of it
so they can I did somethin' or other. She tryin' to break
up the Kingdom bad as she could. But I nev' like nobody even hear
me fus; none of 'em see me fight.
An' so...An', an' ah, that time, ah, ah, Clara, she come to
the do'. An' ah, Clara brought the cane back [in] at 'er. I said, "Uh-uh,
Clara, don't you hit 'er." I said, "She talkin' to me."
An' I said, "Don't hit 'er." Clara hit 'er wit' that, that big
cane, I know she'd a-been a dead woman. That's a great big thing,
ya know? Them ol' big jintes cane, they call it. An' I 
pushed Clara back. An' then she stan' on over too, ya know,
at the door. I pushed Clara back.
An' ah, that time, I, I walk around there.
"You hit the ground! You hit the ground!" (In Gertrude's voice.)
I walked on on the ground. An' I wa' still talkin' to 'er.
An' ah, so I see what she tryin' ta do. She tryin' ta back out,
you know, in the, in the, into the, you know, settlement, where the
people could see it.
So I jus' [talked] called (caught to her coat?) to her colt an' put 'er back where I could try an'
[child] talkt to her. Said, "Gertrude, you know you can't fight me." I 
said, "Whyntcha you go somewhere an' sit down? Go lay down somewhere."
