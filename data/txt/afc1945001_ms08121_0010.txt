to go down and buy 50 cans of milk before
those hoarders get there and stock up."

One day the cook at one of the Army
camps was seen putting a kitchen sink
into a large kettle of soup the seargent
steped up and said, "Why are you doing that."
the cook replied, "I am getting sick and 
tierd of hearing these rookies complain
that my soup has everything but
the kitchen sink in it."

A yard-bird was groming a donkey
one day when the general past by,
the yard-bird stopped him and said,
"Look general does this donkey look like
a Jap." the general replied, "No, why."
The yard bird said well every time I turn 
around he stabs me in the back."

"--and when I threaten to go home to mothers
my husband just laughs, he knows my
mother's house is equiped with an oil
burner."

Little kid said to his pal, "I'd run away 
and join the navy in a minuet, but
they make you go to school there too."
