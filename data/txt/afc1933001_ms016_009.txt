round-up does not reply to my letters. 
I wonder if you could help by 
seeing Richard Kleberg, in Washington? 
Of course we will 
go ahead and possibly get 
the material from other sources, 
though I do hate to give up 
the other plan, for he has a large 
force of vaqueros and we could 
through them cover a big section 
quickly.

When you do write address 
me at University - Station, Austin, Tex. 
Our movements are too uncertain 
to give any other address. Sunday we 
will set up our machine in the 
crumbled walls of the old Don Juan 
Mission, built in 1731, where we are 
to be met by a large group of 
Mexican ballad singers.

Sincerely,
John A. Lomax
