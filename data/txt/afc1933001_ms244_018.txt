the Negro will soon discover
what you wish to hear. He'll 
give it to you. What he really
thinks will remain hidden
securely in the "back of his
head." You and I when we
worked together [are] were fair to
ourselves and we were fair
to the Negro. We put everything
down just as we heard it
with no leading questions.
Any other plan, in my judgment,
is a waste of time and money,
futile and worthless, doing no
good and self-destructive.
