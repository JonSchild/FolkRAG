The Ram of Darby
1. As I went down to Darby on a market day
I spied the fattest ram, sir that ever was fed on hay.
This ram was fat behind, sir.
This ram was fat before.
This ram was ten rod high, sir!
(I'm sure he was no more.)

This ram did have four feet, sir
And on them he did stand
And every hoof he had sir
It covered an acre of land.

The wool growed on this ram's neck
It growed so short and thick
It caused the girls in Darby
A season for to pick.

The wool growed on this ram's sides
It growed so long and thin
It caused the girls in Darby
A season for to spin.

The wool growed on this ram's belly
It growed into the ground
And it was sent to Darby
And sold for a thousand pound.
