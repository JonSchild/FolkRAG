Dear Alan: Speaking once 
more of Introductions I submit 
a first draft of what I 
plan to say in the beginning 
of the Adventures. I invite 
your criticisms 

1. Along with Bodie's letter 
to Columbia I lost or mislaid
around your section of the 
Library some mighty valuable
memorandas. Please
keep your eyes peeled for them.
