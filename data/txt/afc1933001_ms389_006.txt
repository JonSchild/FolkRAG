Professor Hudson begins by saying "the songs exhibited in this
book were collected from white people of Mississippi". (P. 1.)
I suppose that it was largely for reasons of simplification that
he included no admitted Negro songs in the book titled Mississippi
Folk Songs. Yet, even if he can escape the charge of prejudice
when he prints the "Boll Weevil" and "Frankie" without a mention
of Negro singing, still he vitiates the promise of his sociological
approach by his failure to discuss the Negro and his influence
on flaxen-haired Anglo-American folk-songs. For it is precisely 
at this point -- the inter-influence of white and Negro
folk-songs -- that American folk-music as a whole has and is exhibiting
its greatest fertility.

Note. "Mississippi Folk Songs" contained no music. Dr. George
Herzog and Herbert Halpert have recently supplied this need by
editing Professor Hudson's collection of folk-tunes and issuing
this indispensable supplement to this book as a bulletin of the 
W.P.A.'s Theatre Project.
