would be hard or impossible to duplicate
now. I spent 2 weeks in the N.Y. Library
and could find no words or music for
over 75 spirituals that I got and 9/10
of them are old-timey style.

They must be presented but I want
hard records for my own pleasure.

About coöperating with Prof. Thompson
& Helen Flanders, I can't see how I
can spare the time — unless it's a paying
job. Perhaps not even then.

The recorder, Linc. Thompson's 1935 vintage
that I made the records with is still
in excellent shape.

Just been listening to your Tues
A.M. lumberjacks songs. You did a
swell job! Sincerely Ned [Je?]
