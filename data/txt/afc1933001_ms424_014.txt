OH! YOU BUILD AND YOU TURN

(Manuscript)


Oh! you build and you turn,
And you plow and you sow,
And you hammer and you churn,
Tell me, comrade, what you earn?

Chorus: Cling, clang, clang, cling,
The hammer sings its song.
Cling, clang, clang, cling,
Break the chains that bound you long.

Oh! how is your table spread?
And how is your daily bread?
And how is your own strong sword?
And what joy is your reward?

Chorus: Cling, clang, clang, cling,
The hammer sings its song.
Cling, clang, clang, cling,
Break the chains that bound you long.

Men of labor, oh awake,
And recognize your might,
If your strong arms only will
All of industry is still.

Chorus: Cling, clang, clang, cling,
The hammer sings its song,
Cling, clang, clang, cling,
Break the chains that bound you long.
