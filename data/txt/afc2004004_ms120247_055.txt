command.  Some hountahs I have observed
seem content to allow the voice of the mama drum to remain
inconspicuous for long periods as a subtle running commentary
on the steady ejaculations of the kata and the segon, using
their batons on the wooden sides of their instruments to produce
a steady knocking.  When the singing or the possessions or
the dancing grows exciting, the hountah makes his big drum
roar and chrash and drown the others out with his baguette.
At such times the hountah will stand over his drummaking roll
after roll with the baguette, concluding each roll with
such a mighty stroke that you think the head of the
drum might be split and roaring or grunting himself in a marvellous
animal ejaculation with each heavy concluding stroke.
Ciceron Marseille, a hountah, is the man who
made these drums.  He is forty-five years old and such a thin
frail andshambling bag of bones that when
one first encounters him one takes him to be a sort of weak
patriarch whose sone hoe the earth him.  His arms
are thin and lean and flabby but they can
outdrum anyone in the whole sectino hour after hour during
a night long dance or a ceremony that may last for days.
These stringy arms end in the most remarkable
hands I ever saw.  They remind one of the feet of an 
ostrich
