OUR SINGING COUNTRY. Collected
and compiled by JOHN A. LOMAX and
ALAN LOMAX; RUTH CRAWFORD SEEGER,
Music Editor. (Macmillan. Price, $5.)

For years John A. Lomax has been going
here and there up and down this country
hunting folk songs, bringing them to the
attention of lovers of such songs, and in a 
novel way, teaching us much that me might
not have learned otherwise. In this book of
more than 400 pages, in six sections, he has
covered the entire field without repeating 
former offerings, although one notes variants
of well-known ballads which will have but
little interest for other than ballad enthusiasts.

Apparently new in American collections, 
are the examples from the Cajun country of
Louisiana and the Bahaman Negro songs.
"Belle," among the former, is one of the
most attractive numbers.

An interesting musical preface by the
music editor is a sympathetic and understanding
commentary on ballad music. It gives 
painstaking suggestions for the singing as
well as explanation of terms and signs used 
--a valuable contribution.

The book is a real contribution. Being a
Methodist, I found my risibilities aroused
when I noted that Charles Wesley's lugubrious
funeral hymn, "Ah! Lovely Appearance
of Death," had been included. Not
only included; it has been accredited to 
George Whitefield! It would take more
space than is available to give the story of
