FOLK MUSIC RECORDINGS MADE BY MR. ALAN LOMAX
Gaelic Producer, Glasgow.             22nd August 1951.
Copy to:- H.S.M.; Mr. Lomax (Glasgow) 

Since asking whether you could help us in connection with 
the above, I have received from Mr. Lomax a list of the recordings 
he has made in the Hebrides and other parts of Scotland. After a 
brief perusal of this list it is quite evident that neither of us 
can probably undertake at present the work involved in making a 
careful selection from the fifty odd reels.

I have had a word with H.C.P.Ops. about this and what we 
suggest, therefore, is that we should get these tapes down to 
London (either when Mr. Lomax himself comes back or, if he prefers,
in advance of this) and that we should arrange here - except for a 
very few which we think we can eliminate on first perusal of the
list - for them to be re-recorded on to BBC tapes as they stand.

They could then await examination at leisure and would 
allow for careful consideration at a later stage.

Needless to say if you feel able to give us at this stage 
any advice which would help to reduce the amount of dubbing we 
did in the first place I should be most grateful.  Apart from 
any observations you may care to make, my own view is that we 
can omit Reel 1 (recordings by Jimmy Miller and Mrs. Miller -
whom we are hoping to record ourselves more at length in the 
near future); Reel 7 supplementary (the Junior Choirs); 
Reel 27 & 28 (which appear to be dubbings from BBC recordings).
