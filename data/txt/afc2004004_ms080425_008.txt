[*Picnic*]
[*#216 cont.*]

Man;   The biggest kit I've ever seen.
People laughing, lots of noise, talking.
Talk about children in the cemetary. "Look at the camera,
Brian, look at the camera". "She's the mama."

Silence.

Grace begins:
. . .choose all of our changes for us, and gracious God,
when we come to the end of the way, die we realize we must,
we only beg you, o Lord, give us some peaceful hour
in which to part, after death, unite us with our
loved ones. . . . . .
Amen.

Man:   Everybody come up now and help yourself.   Use both
sides of the table, just get your plate and fill it up.

Talking, etc.  People eating, laughing, chatting. 5-10 minutes

Harp singer?
