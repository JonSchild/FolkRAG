church would be a real contribution. As a matter of
fact, I am already interested (I was before your letter
came, I mean) in the Holiness project and was planning
to apply to the Rosenwald people for aid in carrying it
out. But my chances of getting the aid are much better 
with you, I am sure.

I have attached a hastily-draw-up sketch of what 
might be done on the Holiness Church.

You mentioned a suggestion of an alternate plan. I think quite
often that we know too little about the influence on the Negro's thoughts
and actions of such things as the following:

"Wakes"  (You know, the sitting up with the dead?)
"Shooting Craps"
Hunting
"Box Suppers"
"Feasts-in-the-Wilderness"
Saturday-Night  "Break-downs"
Secret Societies
Baptizings
Etc.

Raper, Powdermaker, etc., have merely touched the surface of the material
in these things, these "extra-curricular" activities of the Negro in the
South, if you please.  I think of no over-all name for such a study, but it
might be well worthwhile.

The study of the Holiness Church, to repeat, appeals to me: (1) perhaps
because I have had, in doing my thesis, some experience in visiting
churches and the homes of church people in order to learn of their religious
practices; (2) it gives me an excellent chance to use all the speech psychology,
etc., of which I have heard so much in the Speech Department here; (3)
my birth, experiences (in school and teaching school), education, friends
and relatives seem to fit me to do such a study.

This has been rushed.  Please let me hear from you further concerning
the project; I should like to do either one you might think that I can do.  Do
you think that I should continue to plan on sending my application to the
Rosenwald Fund or wait to see if it can go through with your project?

I hope this has not all been too late.

Sincerely yours,

W.H. Pipes
