5. Colorado Mining Ballads                                                 Estimated cost
   Duncan Emrich, Professor at Denver University, has been
making a study of the mining ballads of the West, and wishes
during the winter to record for us the ballads and lore of
the miners within reach of Denver. He has asked that we
send him fifty blank records, needles, and finally duplicates
of these. This is an area from which the Library has no material.
$120.00

Detroit Foreign Minority Music
   Emmelyn Gardner, Professor of English at Wayne
University, is one of the most eminent folklorists in
America. Her ballad classes, composed mostly of students
of foreign extraction from the Detroit industrial area,
conducts a continual folk-song search in the Foreign
language field in Detroit. Miss Gardner has asked that
we lend her a machine to be used under her supervision in
recording foreign minority music in the Detroit area.
This is one of the most important fields in American folksong,
one into which the Library has made only tentative
ventures, and one in which we must take further steps.
Miss Gardner's proposal offers a valuable opportunity
for this.
c. Duplication of Collections outside the Library of Congress
   The Recording Laboratory was set up partly to duplicate
already existing record collections and to centralize them
in the Library of Congress. The following groups of records
are those which will add very important material to our
collections.
1. The Hispanic-American Collection at Columbia University
   Professor De Onis, head of the Institute of Hispanic
Studies at Columbia University, has brought together a
very important and basic collection of field recordings of
Spanish folk-songs, partly made in Spain, partly in this
country. This material is of permanent value and, of
course, of particular interest at this time. Mr. Onis
wishes to trade with us on a record for record basis and
will accept copies of our Latin American recordings in
exchange for the copies of his collection which he will
send to us. He has 300 records in his collection and
will expect the Archive to furnish him with 300 records
in return. Cost of duplication approximately:
400.00
Note: a great part of his collection is made on 10-inch
records.
