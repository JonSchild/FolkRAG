Young Charlotte lived by the mountain side 
In a wild and lonely spot.

In the town of Athol lived one Jimmy Lannigan
Battered away till he hadn't a pound
His father, he died and he made him a man again
Left him a house and tim acres of ground.

Twas there she won the heart of Paddy Casey
Her hair was like the raven's wing
Her throat was like the swan
She was the prettiest Irish girl
That 'ere the sun shone on 
I took her out upon the grass
To dance the "Rocky Road"

When the police force paraded
On its semi-annual day
Tim Trolin was the best man in the line
And the Germans had to say
Tho' much agains't their will
Tim Trolin was a hundred karats fine.

Three perished in the storm
Twas on one cold and winter's night
The snow was falling fast
A mother and two little babes
Were wandering in the blast.
