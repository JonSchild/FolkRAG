OFFICE MEMORANDUM
                  OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION


To:          Alan Lomax                                  Date: 12/28/42

From:     James Allen

Subject:    Your memorandum of December 22
             
                       In reply to the attached memorandum,
                there is no way in which the OPA can direct
                the local boards to give extra gasoline supplies
                to the four people you mention. I am afraid
                that each person will have to accept the decision
                of his own local board on the question. I am 
                sorry I have not been able to help you in this.
 
                         [*Fellowships*]
