Fisk, 13.   7.

S:  I think I learnt it in some songs what I sent [& got] once.
A:  You got that out of a book?
S"  Yes.
A"  How'd you learn the tune?
S:  Well, I had heard the tune in a show.
A:  In Memphis?  Was that song popular round [*manys?]* the folks.
S:  Yessir, right smart.
A:  When was that?
S:  Let me see, when did I learn that?  I don't know.  I think it
was about 19-- about 1907.

It's ignorance, you know, most of our people is ignorant, most of em
is ignorant.  And er-uh they think anything that old boss like that they
ought to do it.  They think uh-we can't live without getting help from
him.  And er-uh, as a general thing, they don't like a smart nigger, that
is one that knows too much for his own interests or his own race.
Course they had rather have a man that they have to tell him when to do anything,
that they have to put tha finger on it, that a man that knows what
to do, mighty few of um - [thout?] it's a northern man.
You take a norther man, he rather have man that got good learnin or
good understanding, but the Southern white people as a general have rather ignorant
niggers, niggers that don't know more'n they tell him.  "You not supposed to know.
Do what I tell you to do."
A:  What about Negroes themselves?  Do they like educated people
best?
S:  Well, the high class of them do, them that's got education, and the
people that is tryin to educate one another, [th. [tp?d] - er-uh.
                   (end of section?)
As a general thing, they's such a few colored people in this country that
they can help one another.  They go to get help from the white people.
