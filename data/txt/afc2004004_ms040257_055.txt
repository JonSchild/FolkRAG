I'm a little orphen girl
My mother she is dead
My father is a drunkard
And won't buy me my bread.

I sit upon the window sill
To hear the organ play
And think of my dear mother
Who's dead and far away.

Ding-dong my castle bell
Farewell to my mother
Bury me in the old churchyard
Beside my eldest brother.

My coffin shall be white
Six little angels by my side
Two to sing and two to play
And two to carry my soul away.

Ding-dong my castle bell
Farewell to my mother
Bury me in the old churchyard
Beside my eldest brother.

Water, water wallflower
Growing up so high,
We are all maidens
And we must all die.

Water, water wallflower
Growing up so high,
We are all maidens
And we must all die.

Except Alice Henderson
For she's the fondest lover,
She can dance and she can sing
And she can lick the sugar.

Fie, fie, fie for shame
Turn your face to the wall again.

32.
There's a little sandy girl
Sitting on a stone,
Crying, weeping,
All the day alone.

Rise up sandy girl,
Wipe your tears away,
And choose the one that you love best
And then run away.
