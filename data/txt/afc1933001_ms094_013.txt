Dear Mr. John and Mrs. Lomax and Alan:

I'm going
to send this to the Library of Congress, so
you can't say you haven't heard from me, you
can't say the letter got misdirected at Dallas.
It's just a note but I'm thinking of you -- it
is so hard to sit down to a typewriter over
here and write -- the time, the distance, the
censor, especially it's hard after you've got
in the habit of cabling every day to a paper.
The Ambassador is a great, good man
and is being very successful. But we're all
discouraged about the slowness of our country
to get moving.

Good luck.

As ever,
Ben Robinson
