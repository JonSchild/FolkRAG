Chief, Bureau of Public Inquiring   8/17/42
Field Representative - Ohio
“Rumor” Report due August 17, 1942

This report has been held up in Columbus, waiting for
receipt of additional material from Cleveland. However,
as the material has not arrived this morning, I 
am having it sent, under separate cover direct from
Cleveland as a supplement to this report.

The usual ribbon copy and two carbons are enclosed.
