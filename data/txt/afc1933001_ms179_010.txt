Dear Mrs. Shumaker:

     Thank you for the coat of arms and information
about my genealogy. It is my understanding
my family goes back to North Carolina
and Virginia so I am sure we are related. I
am going to sent your letter on to my father
who will undoubtedly be interested in it.

Thank you again for your comments.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
