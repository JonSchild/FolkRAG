If a Music Publisher[s] is being brought in for the States and
another for over here then is your suggestion that you negotiate
the States and I do Europe? Or shouldn't we [each a] both be doing
both on an equal footing?
With regard to this end (which is most important for artists
and BBC point of view) we could do this with our own publishing
company which is now operating through Chappells. It is called
EFDS Publications Ltd. and address is 50 New Bond St., London W.1.
Would Lochrae Music be agreeable to Chappells doing this and come
to an understanding with Chappells in New York. (You will remember
that it was your own legal adviser bloke whose name I forget who
advised us to go to Chappells).
Let me know about this and I can go ahead quickly and get the
material copyrighted here as soon as possible. There is considerable
feeling that this should be done with some urgency. Perhaps you would
arrange for Caedmon to send the originals of music and words to us
through the Chappell New York office.
In the meantime I have been sorting out the material for the
next five records in the following categories - 

6. STORMY OLD WEATHER
Music of Shipboard and Shoreline

7. WILD AND WICKED YOUTH
Ballads of Fair Game and Foul

8. PEDLAR'S PACK
Ballads from All Quarters (Broadside

9. WASSAIL
Music of the Festive Seasons

10. JIG AND [H]JINGLE
A Collection of Play and Rhyme

These suggestions I have sent to Caedmon and I would like to know
if you approve before doing too much[y] work. [1/2)

6. "Windy Old Weather [w]has already been used for a record here
and I prefer to include the Stormy one of Bob Roberts on 6. I have
decided that [I]the whole record comes to life when one omits shanties
particu[;]larly as nearly all recordings are without chorus. Have just
done a complete shantey record with chorus for HMV of Stan Hugill.
Suggsest we keep shanties in reserve.

7. I am wondering whether the theme "Crafty and Cunning" wouldn't
be better?

8. This record bringing in all regional titles has good variety,
as well as many of important Ballads omitted from Child.

9. To include drinking songs

10. A record possible for child audience with all nonsense and
make-believe material, rhymes, extracts mummers etc.

Any more news of your being able to come over and spend some time
on these next five. We are so much missing you, looking forward to
meeting Toni, though we hear about you through all the many American
visitors over this year.
Love from Eirlys, Dave, Jonny and Little Jenny (she's great)
