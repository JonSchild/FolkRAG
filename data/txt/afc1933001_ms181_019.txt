Dear Ironhead:

On March 20th I wrote you about the use of
one of your records by the Library of Congress for
pressing purposes. Up until now I haven't heard from
you and the release of these records is being delayed 
by your failure to reply.

Do please send me an answer soon,

Sincerely your friend,
Alan Lomax
