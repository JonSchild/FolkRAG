Mr. Alan Lomax,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax,
Your letter about the Folk Songs has only just
reached me, as I have been away for some time.
If you are in our neighborhood, we would be glad
to have you "stop by." Our children would sing
you a number of the ballads, and we could talk
about them. Although we are not on the
railroad, the roads are good.
With regrets for the delay, I am
Sincerely yours,
Anne Cobb
