Rationing
1.  Restrictions will soon be put into effect stopping all automobile travel 
between Arizona and Pacific Coast cities, except on three days each week, 
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  (Two salesmen for large wholesale company 
Prescott, 8-10-42)
2.  I know positively that plans have been made and rules issued to confiscate 
on September all automobile tires not used in defense work.  (Newspaper 
man, daily paper.  Prescott, 8-11-42)
3.  I have heard it said that the Jews in New York are sorting the rubber 
turned in during the rubber drive and are getting $400 a ton for some 
of it.  (Supervisor for training for auxilliary police in the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's office.  Phoenix 8-14-42)
4.  It is my understanding that there are wide-spread black market activities 
in connection with the distribution of steel.  (Training official connected

5.  I can buy 80,000 automobile tires in Los Angeles if I want to pay $40 
each.  When I was at Wenden, Arizona, at a police school, an agent came 
through offering to sell all the tires desired by dealers at $25 each, 
with not less than 12 in one delivery.  This agent came on to Wickenburg, 
Arizona, and made the same offier.  Nothing was done about it.  (Supervisor 
of training for auxilliary police in Maricopa County Sheriff's office.  8-14-42)
