Mr. Alan Lomax
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was glad to receive your letter of February 28, and wish to say that I have long desired to meet you and Professor Lomax. I hope it will be my luck to do so before very long.

I have known of the work of the Library of Congress in collecting and recording folksongs, but did not realize the dimensions of the archive which has been gathered to date. Am delighted to hear that you can make these field trips, and hope you facilities will never run out until there's no more work of the sort to be done. I have seen the catalogue which the division issued some time ago--no doubt it could be added to considerably by this time. You are quite right in assuming that I have done no field recording with mechanical equipment--I have seen the process of recording songs in that fashion only once.

The news that you expect to make an expedition into Pennsylvania soon is certainly most interesting. I trust you can--there is enough need of a good, scientific exploration of various parts of that state, heaven knows. Also, I am much pleased that you ask me whether I can do some of the work with you; but my pleasure is mingled with perplexity as to how to respond. I should like very much to be able to help such a good work in every way I can--but I am unfortunately not sure of what I shall be
