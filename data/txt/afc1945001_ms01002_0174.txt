is scanty or is suspected of untruthfulness. If we can supply the potential
audiences of particular rumors with the necessary relevant information then
we can offset the effects of the rumors and check their further diffusion.

Accordingly, our liaison division and through them, the press and radio
should be asked not to reproduce rumors for refutation but should, at our
request or on their own initiative, present authoritative information bearing
on the subject of the rumor. If no information is safely disclosable, then
some aspect of the subject matter should be trusted in a way giving reassurance
to the public.

The Bureau of Intelligence will keep the Liaison Division posted as to
which rumors need treatment.

2.) Rumors may also be counteracted or nipped in the bud by an even
more indirect form of attack: namely by attacking the rumor mongers by
ridicule or by indicating the dangerous consequences of rumor mongering. With
this can be associated, education of the public regarding the typical content
patterns of rumors or any other identifying ear marks of a rumor. This will
make good-intended people more self-aware of their own tendencies towards
irresponsible chatter and it will help them to guard themselves against being
taken in by rumor mongers.

Education for protection against rumor mongering and rumor acceptance
can be done through moving pictures, fiction, feature stories, radio playlets,
cartoons, etc.

Here again it should be noted that we are not refuting particular
rumors. Instead, we are helping people to detect rumors and rumor spreaders, 
and to be distrustful of them.

The Bureau of Intelligence will undertake to supply the Liaison Division
with the key patterns of current rumors.
