Fisk, 15.    2.   WILL STARK

git me some meal."  The say Mr. Barksdale jumped on him and the nigger
whup Mr. Barksdale, and then called on of the agents, say, "Clyde,
come in and help me whip this nigger."  The nigger whipped Mr. Barksdate 
and Mr. Clyde both.
"Come Mr. Murphy, and help us whip this nigger."  Mr. Clyde say, "Mr. Barksdale, 
let me kill him."  Say, "No, no don't shoot him.  Let's whip

His father lives there on the place [ right]now.
A:  I guess he had to leave, though.
S.  He left, but he didn't have to.  He left.  Mr. Barksdale's the
kind of fellow, when you have a fuss with a nigger, it's all over with
after[wards.] The fuss is over.

                                     TIMES ARE CHANGING.

A:  When did this thing begin to change around here, Will?  And what
do you think was responsible, do
S:  I don't know, sir, I don't know what was the cause of it, but, during this last
[past]administration, it seemed that there were some people from Washington
or somewhere visiting through these countries and they found [oil] it
out or something of the kind, and so many people lost their, so
many of these rich people [lost] lose their plantations or [in] some way or another.
I don't know exactly what was the cause, but I notice they quit.
Now in Mr. Hobson's place down here, where I used to live, a man can
leave there if he ain't satisfied any time he wants to.  But some of these
plantations if you move on they plantation and [start working] start a crop, you have to slip off
or they'll go git you and bring you back and put you in jail.  And er-uh of
course the boss man, they [really] rules the court and one thing or another,
and [you] they have to do like they say or [lose our job] don't them folks can't hold their job that's runnin' the court.
Mr. Hobson, & them it's kinda different on his place.  If a man get ready to move - any time a man get ready to 
move, it's all right if he [not] aint satisfied.  His crop is responsible
