(1) I heard that the Red Cross was a 
crooked organization. If you sent your
son or friend a package they would
make him pay to get it.

(2) During rationing a person complained
right and left. He said that rationing was
not necessary and that the government
didn't know what it was doing.

(3) Two men were talking and the
one said that it looks like we are
winning the war right now, but
he he bet his bottom dollar that
Germany and the Axis had something 
up that would knock us right off of our
feet. 

(4) "Germany will not give in
easily", a man said, "and I'll bet
that she'll put up a big fight
before she ever does.

(5) I've heard a lot of people say
that if the government would feed its own
people instead of sending food abroad
we might have won the war already.
