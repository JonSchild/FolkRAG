Assistant in Charge of the Archive of American Folk Song

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am returning herewith the scripts you were kind enough to lend
us for our story on your documentary radio programs. I am assured by
our radio editor that they provided valuable background guidance in the
writing of the story.

I hope you liked the story.

Sincerely,
W. W. Boddie
