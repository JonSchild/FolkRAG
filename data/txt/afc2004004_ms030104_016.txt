[*Shouting begins*]
An' that man ridin' in his fine car
Won' even pick her up.      OH YES.
[Oh yes] Farin' sumptuously.      God almighty.
God wants you to look around home sometime,
An' see whats goin' on.
This man was farin' sumptuously.
God says, "I'll tell you what I'll do
I've got a chile down there in the world name' Lazarus,
He's a poor man."
[Thank] An' thank God you don' have to be rich to get into Heaven.
Thank God you don' have to have a lotta money to be a chile of God.
Eeeeeverybody, oh glory,
That bow down on their knees
AN' give God their hearts an' journey in glory.      [*[1 00]*]
I heard him as he said to Isaiah back yonder
Oh everyone that thirsteth
Come to the fountain an' buy milk without money or price
I heard him again as he spoke through Matthew
[*Said*] Come to me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden
And I will give you rest.
An' you don' need any money but jus' come on
I see him as he gets Laz'us yonder
An' carry him an' lay him down at the gate
Didn' take him inside
Jus' take him up to the gate there.
An' in my mind I can see that old sick man
Sitting down at the gate there.
Kneebones smotin' together.
Skin is all in sores
From the crown of his head [to the soles of his feet]
Down to the sole of his feet
An' they tell me that the dogs
Brought over the dogs
Came by an' licked his sores.
