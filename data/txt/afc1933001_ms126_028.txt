Mr. Alan Lomax

Dear Alan: 
Dr. Humphreys of the Cosmos Club just 
phoned me about your lecture. He said that 
he was awaiting definite word from you regarding 
November 8. In view of our proposal 
that you go on to Akron, Ohio, I took the 
liberty of suggesting a postponement to 
which he agreed. It seemed the safest things 
to do and I thought that it would be to your 
advantage. I hope that you won't mind and 
will find this arrangement satisfactory. 
With kindest regards, 
Sincerely, 
Acting Chief
Division of Music
