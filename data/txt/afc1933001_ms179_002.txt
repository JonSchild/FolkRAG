Dear Dr. Spivacke:
    I wish to recommend that the Joint Army and Navy Committee on 
Welfare and Recreation lend its assistance to Mr. Bond in making 
his Fort Valley Festival an affair in which the soldiers from 
nearby camps play an important part. I feel sure that if properly 
handled and developed this project will stimulate song-making and 
song singing within the army, and this event will besides be the 
first of other such endeavors in both communities and camps through-
out the country.

    In this case, however, it will be necessary to make some initial 
investment in order that the affair to be as successful and significant 
as it can be. I submit the following plan for your approval:

    1. That John Work, Negro composer and folk-song collector, a charming 
and aimiable man of middle age, be sent to the camps nearby 
Fort Valley for a period of ten days before the festival occurs 
to organize soldier participation. Mr. Work will lend his expert 
dvice to experienced army personnel such as the Sergeant 
Ja    Jackson in Mr. Bond's letter.
    2. It will be necessary, of course, to allow a certain amount of 
rehearsal time to the soldier participants, and to make it 
possible for them conveniently to go to Fort Valley to enter 
the festival.
    3. The Library of Congress Recording equipment should be sent to 
record the festival and the preliminary work and to document the 
whole affair. This will involve participation of the Assistant 
in Charge of the Archive of American Folk-song and one engineer.
    4. Two albums of four records each, of the best material recorded
at the festival, should be made up for distribution throughout 
the army camps to serve as a model for other festivals to follow.

    Appended is a budget comprising the costs of this whole affair, 
exclusive of the shipment of the albums.
