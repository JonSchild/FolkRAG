Dear Mr. Lomax,

Although your letter is dated June 6 it arrived only last night.
It was grand hearing from you, for I have long had an enormous admiration for
the work you have been doing in Washington.

Charlie Smith had already written me of you recordings of Jelly Roll
Morton. My own views about Jelly are somewhat mixed: I realize that some of his
compositions are historically very important and that he exerted more than a
minor influence on American popular music. But frankly, I have never enjoyed
his piano playing at all. He has always seemed heavy-handed and stodgy, with a
faulty ear that permitted atrocious chord sequences that would never occur to
the great genuine [deleted] unschooled blues artists like Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons,
Pete Johnson, Jimmy Johnson, and the scores of other natural folk artists one
can find in the backwoods of this country. 

Do forgive me for my bluntness here. It is quite possible that I may
be wrong or prejudiced; but I have never been able to get excited about Jelly
either as an artist or as a person. Most of the Negro blues artists that I have
known have been great, warn, unostentatious people, and it may be that Jelly's
personality rubbed the wrong way. But I felt the same way about his music
even before I met him.

HOWEVER, I am almost anxious to eat the hard words, and I hope that
your records of him are so excellent that I'll have to turn somersaults. Please
let me know when you would be able to let me hear them in Washington, and
I'll take the first train down.

Sincerely, 

Jim Hammond
