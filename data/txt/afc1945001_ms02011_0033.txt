as an item of social intercourse, should be eliminated. It should not simple be

        The actual writing of the counteracting material is very important. While,
wherever possible, official authoritative statements by people normally responsible
for the sort of material involved should be quoted, they should only be used if their

statement, they should be witheld from the public. This is necessary, inasmuch as 
rumors, since they partake of the folk, tend to be short, concise, catchy, and the
sort of thing that the readers will accept. If the counteraction cannot be of the
same order or superior, the material should be witheld. 
        Security officers must check to be sure that the counteraction program is not
being used as device for getting authoritative information which may be of use to

"phony" be substituted. If regular use of a newspaper outlet in the form of a column
is made, it is preferable that the "phony" and the "facts" appear in the same type,
