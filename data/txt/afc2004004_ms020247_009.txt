Reel 7, Song 7, Page 2

And he found ol' Jonah
Fast asleep,
He said, "Wake up, wake up,
"You're sleepin'," so the man said,
"My God is angry,
"Gonna destroy this land."
(He said)

CHORUS: Throw me overbo' etc.

Well, they cast ol' Jonah
Right overbo'
Along come a whale
An' swallowed Jonah whole.

He layed in the whale
Three long days and nights
And right there,
[*?*] Where they said ol' Jonah prayed.

God spoke to Jonah
Very low,
Said, "I want you to go now
"To Nineveh's sho's."

Then the sun shine hot
And Jonah's afraid,
And Jonah he prayed
To the Lawd for shade.
[*?*]
A gold vine growed
Over Jonah's head,
Along come an earthworm
[*?*] And cut it down, 
You know that left a mark there
On Jonah's ground,
('Cause they)

CHORUS: Throwed him overbo', etc.
