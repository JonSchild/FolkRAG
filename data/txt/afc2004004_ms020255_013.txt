herself. An' said she went to prayin'. An' she asked the Lord
to, you know, ta forgive 'er. An' ah, an' so, she told the Lord,
said "Now, Lord," said, "He's not dead. An' he's a Christian.
You know, he's Your son." You know, he's a real preacher, too.
An' all those things she tried to show God. 
        An' so she said she on, about 'er business, ya know an' after
she got through prayin', continue on 'er work. Comin' from outdo's,
feedin' the chickens, she come up in the do'. An' she says it's a
voice spoke all aroun' 'er; she didn't see nothin'. Says, "Not
yo' goodness that cause Willy to be livin'...The sin lays upon you." 
       You know, now, she told this in the church not one time an'
nobody didn' even -- Elder Wynn didn't know hisself she had, she
had ever been try to be kilt. An' she said she done every thing she
know to do to destroy him, you know, when she wit' 'im. You
know, to keep her father from knowin' she was pregnant. An' you
see what come. An' she was old enough ta, not ta do it, ya know.
She done it; not somebody else. I make you take stuff, why, that
sin's on me. See? An' I -- We got that                                          Ya
know that's true. If I make you take sumpin' you know, like if
you wa' my daughter an' I make you take it, that sin's on me.
But if you take it yourself, that's you, see? An' so ni-- 
        An' when she died, that was it. See? She done all she could.
God meant for 'im to be born. Said, "Not your goodness." An'
that was innocent blood. You should not. 
AL: So this trying to make an abortion happen is a real deadly sin? 
BJ: It's a deadly sin. Because you, you killin' youself also.
Tha's you. It's you, you know? Your child is you, a part a you
an' a part a you, your mama. An' it's you also; it's you definite.
See? Come t--, come from you.
