ECONOMIC FRONT - WAR BONDS AND STAMPS

A. Is money really coming in from bond sales?

1.   "I wonder how much money actually reaches the Government
to be used in the prosecution of the war effort
from the purchase of bonds? In my opinion if other
companies are handling this matter like the one that
I'm working for I doubt if I want to buy these bonds
for the reason that our company seems to keep the
money on hand in the safe for a long time and I understand 
that the banks are keeping it on hand for quite
a long while and there is a question in my mind as to 
just when the Government actually gets this money so
they can use it. " (Colorado)

2. "Just how much money is Uncle Sam getting on these war
bonds from people who are pledging a certain percent
of their salary, etc.? People are quitting this
company so fast that it seems if you have worked here
only a short time you are considered an old timer.
When they leave they go to the cashier and say, 'I
have a certain amount coming to me: I was going to
buy a war bond with it but I am leaving so give me
my money', and the cashier gives them the money that
was intended to purchase a bond." (Colorado)

B. Buying is very uneven, different groups not holding up their end.

3. "This is one of the high ranking states in the Union
as far as the purchase of bonds is concerned and
further they are taking more of our men for the Armed
Forces per capita than any other state. The eastern 
states are not buying the bonds even though they have
the war industries, nor are they furnishing their share
of the men for the Armed Services." (North Dakota)

4. "It is my understanding that the Republican precincts
in Des Moines have a lower percentage of War Bond
purchases than the other precincts." (Iowa)

C. People are buying under pressure -- buy, then cash in.

5. "A lot of workers are buying bonds because they feel
they are being compelled to and then they are cashing
in these bonds soon after they buy them." (Minnesota)

6. "I understand that many federal government employees
have been very cooperative in regard to giving 10% of
their income to the Government for the purchase of war
bonds. They tell me though that some of these people
are pretty hard up -- some of them don't make very 
large salaries and about a third of them cash in their
bonds just as quickly as they can. Some of them have
bought four or five $50 bonds but they have cashed in
all but the one on which they are making payments. Is
there anything to such rumors?" (Colorado)
