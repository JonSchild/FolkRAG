Bessie Jones, Reel 1

LORD, OUR NEIGHBOR'S SO SWEET
A song from Nassau

My!  Hi!
What you want?
The baby didn't cry?

One a-thing I don't understand,
Why a woman's sweeter than man.
Guava jelly,
But a young gal's better,
Lord, our neighbor's so sweet, Hu! (2)
Lord, our neighbor's so sweet.

One thing I can't understand.
Why the woman's so sweeter than man,
Guava jelly,
Young gal's better,
Lord, our neighbor's so sweet, hu!  (2)
