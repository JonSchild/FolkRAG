BJ TAPE 3,  p. 22

BJ:     Ya have!  Well, that's our church.  We got everything there.
We got a hairdresser, park there (?), we got the post
office, we got everything there!  An' in that church -- you see
those things up in there -- I don' know where was there when you
was there -- they got big signs there, whatsoever you come from?
Hit's so large until -- Georgia got it's own state, Alabama State,
every state, they got its own  -- you can see the sign.  Wherever
you sit, when you walk in there. An' all across in Africa an'
other parts of the country. An' when the meetin' open there --
it ain' all close now, see; it close in September -- but when the
meetin' open there, hit don't, the door open, it don't shet a
night an' a day until the meetin' close.  'Cause, ya see, there's
so many people that some got to go on all night long.  It's
goin' all day an' all night long.  So many preachers an' so
many people.  Some's goin' on to sleep, some [of 'em] goin' back
to church, all day an' all night.  Now, that's the temple of this
Church of God in Christ.

But this handed down to him when the Lawd...

AL:     But Mason was the actual founder...

BJ:      Actual foundation, he, yeah...

AL:     Of this movement.

BJ:      An' handed down to him. Ah, an' he was prayin' -- I has a
book of it to the house.  But he was praying and after the Lord
had, had, had whupped him out, he didn't want to be a preacher.
And he had done denied that holiness.   He jes' -- I'll tell ya,
he came to it jes' like Paul.  Jes' like Paul he came to it.
