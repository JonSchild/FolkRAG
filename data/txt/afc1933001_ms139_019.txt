Detroit, Michigan

Dear Mr. Frazier:

Thank you for your kind letter. Indeed I have not forgotten
my promise to you and I will send you your duplicate
record just as soon as I get my equipment together. In regard
to the other matters we talked about, you'll have to
wait awhile, but remember that I'm doing my best for both
you and Sampson (give him my best regards and tell him
I'll write to him as soon as I have any definite news for
him).

I am very well and hope you and all of your family
are the same.

With very best regards, I am

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
