Dr. Herbert Putnam,
Librarian of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

My dear Dr. Putnam:

Miss Eve Maxwell-Lyte, of London, England, 
will give a program of folk songs at the Washington 
Club, Wednesday, March 23, 1938, at 8:30 P.M. This 
recital is sponsored by members of the Bar of the 
District of Columbia who met Miss Lyte last summer 
in London en route to an international law congress 
at The Hague.

On behalf of this group, whose names appear 
below, I extend a cordial invitation to you to attend 
Miss Lyte's recital, which marks her first appearance 
in Washington, after a tour of Canada.

Very truly yours,

Mary Agnes Brown
