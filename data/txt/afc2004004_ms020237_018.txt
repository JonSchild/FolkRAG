TJ: What's he got a table on his head for? 
BJ: Well, perhaps he carryin' it home! But that...
    But what is this here, these about the laigs? "Now, ah, two 
laigs settin' on three laigs with one laigs in his lap. Up comes
four laigs an' grabs one laig. Up jumps two laigs an' grabs three
laigs; throws three laigs at four laigs; makes four laigs put 'em --
bring one laig -- put one laig down."
TL: Not a no-legs                 !
BJ: Not a no...ha, ha, ha! That's easy now. Two legs settin' on
three legs. An' got one leg in 'is lap, see? Up comes fo' laigs an'
grabs one laig. See? Up jumps two laigs an' grabs three laigs.
Throws it at four-laigs an' makes four-laigs put one-laig down...
That's easy.
TL: What am I supposed to say, who's on the ground?
BJ: N-no, ya ask me ta, ta tell ya what the whole riddle is.
TL: There's a whole bunch of chairs stacked on top and...
BJ: No, chair cain't kick -- ah, chairs can't chuck [none] nothin'...Said 
three-laigs sittin' on, I mean two-laigs sittin' on three-laigs. 
Then got one laig in 'is lap. 
TL: It's a three-legged stool with a man sittin' on it. 
BJ: That's right.
TL: An' he's got a one-legged thing in his hand?
BJ: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! He got a ham a meat in 'is lap...An'

TL: Four-legs comes along. The dog.
BJ: Um-hum. an' grabbed it. An' he jumped up an' grabbed the
three-laigs, the stool. 
TL: No, the one-leg. 
BJ: He jumped up an' grabbed the three.
