My dear sir:

You err. I was not bitter, only emphatic. I definitely
do not care for the professional reformer and their bland
assumption that their definition of democracy is correct
and that all who disagree with them are enemies of the
South. The so-called, self-called "Liberals" of today are
the most illiberal tribe of locusts that have ever infected
our country. Take for example Eleanor Roosevelt and Sidney
Hillman. The class warfare you and their ilk promote
will reap a whirlwind if your efforts are successful.

Yours sincerely,

(Signed)
