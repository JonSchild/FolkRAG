enleid, and the German folk tale, said Grimm,
was the origin of poetry.

Close on the theoretical heels of Grimm came that
prodigy among scholars, the great and influential Gruntrig 
of Denmark, whom Child (and through Child all other
English ballad students) have taken as their preceptor.
For Gruntvig the ballads were a production of a "folk-poetic 
period in which all the people sang with one accord."
They thus expressed the individuality of a people and not 
the individuality of single poets, who perhaps made them.
Because of this, Gruntvig felt that every version of a ballad
was of equal worth and authenticity, and he believed
that all possible versions  of his Scandanavian folk-songs,  recoverable from manuscript and
oral sources, should be printed with annotations and collations.  
This gigantic task Gruntvig could not carry to its 
conclusion before his death in 1883, but other scholars,
among them Orlick and Kristman, have almost completed the
work.

Francis James Child regarded his last edition of
[ " ]English and Scottish Popular Ballads["], fashioned in the
manner of Gruntvig's editions, as the cannon for the popular
ballad in English and so it has been regarded by all
subsequent scholars.  If Professor Kittredge were asked
to define the English ballad, he would point to this book
and it is on this collection that the opinions of English
scholars about folk-ballads and folk-poetry in general
are based.
