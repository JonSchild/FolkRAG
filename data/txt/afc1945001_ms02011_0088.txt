The following rules for rumor control were released by the Office
of War Information on November 30, 1942 and may be used as the
basis for a continuing program.
     1. Never repeat a rumor.
     2. Never repeat a rumor verbally even to deny it.
     3. If you know the facts which can spike a rumor,
         cite the facts promptly.
     4. If you do not know the facts which can stop a
         rumor, ask the rumor-teller where he got his
         facts.
     5. Don't give a rumor a break.
