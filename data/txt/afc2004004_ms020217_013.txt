they didn't know how to hide those things.  But just a few -- I
was the on'y one -- I ain' got no sisters or brothers [--] dead nor
living, in no way shape or form, no -- and so, they would just take
them from one place to the other, you know.  That way I stay with
'em at different times, not known' what happin' at home.  They be 
hidin' toys, putting up everythin', makin' dresses and puttin' em
back so I wouldn't see 'em 'till Christmas, y'see? ______________________
GO OVer there, that place, but they workin', it's all right, 'cause I 
was with good people.  Those people, they wouldn't beat a child because
[*whipping*]
they hate the parents.  They would beat a child for what the child do.
And that's what I believe in today; I don't b'lieve in a person gettin'
mad at the parents and then takin' spite out on their chulren. You know;
that's why people stopped folks from beatin' their chulren so much.
'Cause some folks do it for spite.  "I don' like so-and-so," and then
they whup their chulren.An' overdo the thing, y' know. And a whole
lot of that stuff to prevent people from whuppin their chulren. "Now,
I know why you hit my chile, 'cause you don't like me." Then, that's
a big mess starts, see?  Well, we didn' have that; nothin' like that
at home.  And now nights an the sun's down, children's supposed to be
home.  But you see, nowadays and times, you got to hunt for 'em, in
the night time, you see.  That's the difference in raisin' and trainin', y'see.  
[*meaning of training*] 
The Bible said, "Train your chile in the way that you have 'em
to go."  But raise a child just like a hawg.  You give him feed and 
let him go.  An' time for feed [hi] again, he come up to the stall.
Ha, that's raisin' something'.  We use the word raise, but the right
way is I was brought up, or I was trained up, in such-and-such a place
or such-and-such a town or what-not, with your family -- if you was 
trained.  But if you was raised, why you just raised, that's all.
That's all to that.  We knew the word raised.  Raised is just -- like
a chicken; you raise chickens; you raise hawgs; you raise cows; you
feed 'em, an' that's all, let 'em grow, no trainin'.  You just take
a monkey or a ape or anything that they got in a show, and they not
on'y fee 'em, they train 'em.
