commercial artists have, therefore, become important in industry. They are in demand, —
well paid — machines can never displace them. Artistic talent is comparatively
scarce. If you can draw, why waste this rare gift? Train yourself to do
work for which nature has fitted you and which few people can do. Success nowadays
comes easier to those who develop natural ability. We have trained many
young men and women now capable of earning up to $5,000 yearly as artists. Use
this opportunity to test your talent. Read the rules and send us your drawing.

Are You a One-Eyed Menace?
-then it's time to
Check 
your 
LIGHTING WIRES
It will be a one-eyed monster
Both dangerous and dire
Until its careless owner has 
Replaced the lighting wire.
Your Car Needs Good Lighting Wires
Lighting wires wear out because vibration,
oil, and moisture ruin insulations.
Short circuits then burn out light bulbs
— run down the battery—cause
fires. They are constant sources of
trouble and danger on the highway.
Have your serviceman REPLACE worn
wiring as well as burned out bulbs.
And for SAFETY'S SAKE, use Belden
Lighting Wires. They're engineered
for modern driving conditions. Ask
for them where you see this sign.

Casey Jones was the Rounder's Name
Continued from page 26
looked at his watch. It read 3:45. They 
were only two minutes behind schedule.
Casey knew that a heavy freight train,
No. 83, was lumbering along ahead of 
him. He knew that No. 83 had orders to 
stand on the siding at Vaughan, a track
that paralleled the main track, until his
train passed.  Casey knew, too, that another 
long freight train, No. 72, was 
headed toward him and he knew that
No. 72 also had orders to put in at the
siding until he passed.
In addition to the siding, which was
on one side of the main track, there was 
a "house track" on the other side, behind
the little wooden Vaughan station.
Casey knew that the New Orleans-
Memphis local passenger No. 26 running
in two sections was waiting there
on the "house track" until he roared
by. But he didn't know...
Setup for Disaster
The siding where the two freight
trains were standing wasn't quite long
enough to accommodate them both.
Four cars of the southbound No. 83
lapped over onto the main track at the
north end of the siding. Conductor Ed
Hoke of No. 83 realized what the situation
was. It wasn't very crucial. He'd 
have No. 72 back up a bit and then move
No. 83 up so that those last four cars
would clear the north end where the
main track joined the siding. He'd flag
Casey Jones' train and tell Casey to pull
down the main track slowly past the north
switch and then wait for a moment until
his train could again be moved up and
No. 72 could then clear the main track
at the south switch. Then Casey could
proceed on his way.
He gave his orders. He said to his
flagman, John Newberry, "Take some
lights and torpedoes and give Casey
Jones on the No. 1 the 'saw by' signal."
The "sawing operation" was a common
feature of a single-track operation
in 1900. A flagman beside the track
sawing one arm across the other was all
that the engineer of an oncoming train
needed to picture the whole situation.
Newberry walked back the prescribed
3,000 feet from the south siding to flag
Casey Jones. He shivered a little in the 
rain, set his torpedo on the rail and then
moved back a bit, ready to wave his
lantern and give Casey the "saw by"
signal.
He pictured No. 72 backing up so that
its last four or five cars would be lapping
over the main track near the south
switch. He pictured No. 83 moving up
getting its four cars off the main track
at the north switch. That is what
should have happened. That would have
happened ninety-nine times out of a
hundred. But this is what actually 
happened:
No. 72 started to back up and an air
hose burst, stopping the train. This
meant that No. 83 still overlapped on
the main track. It doesn't take long to
repair an air hose and pump up the air,
but it took too long on that cold dawn.
Three miles north Casey was coming 
fast. He'd get the signal all right but 
that signal meant that the north switch
was clear and the north switch wasn't
clear.
White-faced men worked frantically
on the air hose. There wasn't time to
send another flagman half a mile north
to give Casey a different signal.
Then they heard Casey's whistle cutting
into the grayish murk of a reluctant
dawn that was still overhung with
the black of night. Casey was just 
practicing and he turned again to grin at Sim
Webb. No. 1 roared through the woods

in the hollow above Vaughan. No. 1
flashed across Cypress Creek and into 
the long curve to the left beyond 
which was a sharp upgrade leading to
Vaughan.
Sim Webb turned and threw one
large shovelful of coal on the fire,
which threw its reflection on his ebony
sweat-streaked face. Then he heard the
roar of the torpedo underneath the
wheels of the locomotive. He felt the
air brakes hiss mightily and then start
to grip the wheels. He lurched to the
gangway of the locomotive just in time
to see the flagman's waving lantern and
then, looking ahead, he saw the read taillights 
very near. The wheels screamed
as the air brakes tried to catch hold, but
those red lights were coming back at a
terrific rate.
Sim Webb screamed to Casey, "Goin' 
to hit. Better jump."
In the dull light of the cab he saw
Casey kick his seat out from under him,
and in that instant the emergency 
brakes grabbed every wheel on the train
and the whistle shrieked out a warning.
But Sim heard no more. He plunged
into the darkness from the gangway,
struck a clump of bushes at the far side
of a little ditch and hurtled head over
heels for twenty feet before he stopped.
Even as he slid along the rough ground
the brakes back through the whole train
were screaming, and the dim outlines of
the baggage and mail cars and the
faintly lighted windows of the coaches
shot past him. As the last car passed
with sparks flying around its wheels,
there was a deafening crash of splintering
wood and hissing steam from up
ahead. Then utter darkness again—as
if a great fiery door, thrown open for
an instant against the night sky, had
been slammed shut again with a mighty
crash.
Sim staggered to his feet, dazed and
badly skinned and bruised, but not seriously 
hurt, and, in the dim light of a lantern
he had found, stumbled ahead
through the shadows beside the coaches.
These were still on the rails, and passengers
and trainmen began pouring out on
the ground and shouting a bedlam of orders
and anxious questions. Up ahead 
Sim saw the dim shape of a baggage car,
off the rails and partly across the track. 
The mail car, next ahead, lay half on its
side in the ditch, while the tender and
overturned locomotive were surrounded
by a mass of splintered wood that had
been a freight-train caboose and several
freight cars. Sim tripped and fell to his
knees in a sea of small gravel which 
proved to be shelled corn, scattered three
feet deep over the track and wreckage.
The Only Fatality
Engine 382 lay in the ditch on its side,
stripped of cab and running boards and
piping as if they had been sheared away
by a huge cleaver. Live steam hissed 
from a dozen broken ends. Close beside 
the twisted rail, under the tender and 
half covered with coal and the shattered
walls of his cab, lay Casey Jones, quite
dead, with the broken end of the whistle
cord still clutched in his hand. His engine
had split through the caboose of No. 83
and a boxcar of baled hay, smashed 
open a boxcar of bulk corn and had
rammed a flatcar loaded with lumber
which lay in heaps in the shallow cut,
almost filling it to the brim. Men were
running about with lanterns and shouting
to one another and checking up on
the crew and passengers. Three of the
crew of No. 1 besides Sim, as well as
two passengers, it eventually developed,
were bruised or otherwise slightly in-
