[After the manger loi you have given, you 
promise some member of your family 
for the loi - if]
Sometimes a man who wants 
money, he gives a secret ceremony
& calls the loi and promises some 
member of his family.

After the [ceremony] manger you 
have to bury everything under 
a cross in the woods - if you 
keep a thing the Petro won't 
depart. You tell them they've got 
to go now, they've been well 
fed, generously - they leave 
and look for another person to 
kill.
