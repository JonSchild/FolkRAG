Reverend Roe  Reel 2 p. 1
I began -- well, I asked the livense topreach, ad they wouldn't allow
me to speak in the church but  there was a woman, very sick, and she
to hear a service.  They sent  me out there, and one of the deacons 
came with me.  I rode a mule bareback.  I went out and there was a 
few people around.  So I had a song and prayer.  The old deacon prayed,
and I had taken as my text, I dont remember the verse, jut the second
chapter of James -- "If there is any sick among you, call for the help
of the church.  Leth them pray for you, all of them, and they shall
save the sick."  I spoke from that text;  I don't remember anything I
said, but when I kind co me to myself, I just talked.  The people was 
all shedding tezars around me, and I couldn't say what I'd done.  The
old deacon there got ready and we went back, and he told them that priest
that is was about the finest servicehe ever done hear, and then they
had me the preacher in the church.  Some men came in to make fun --
it was in the Territory, Indian Territory and  it was awful wild
up there.  They taken seat in front of the pulpit -- "We're gonna have
some fun out of him."  And I taken them out of the pulpit.

it because the man that was pastoring there, you know, he likes for
me topreach and I wouldn8t accept the church.  Then I returned back
because I was said to be the best preacher up in that part of the
country, and I knew that was no place for me.  I had to be where
there was something for me to preach about.  I come on back -- but
let me tell you this story.

been able to understand.  Now yyou had to make a monthly report, the
