August 8, 1940

Mr. Archibald MacLeish, Librarian
Library of Congress
Conway, Mass.

Dear Archie:

     I have shown the enclosed memo to Spivacke and Jamison
and they think it's very fine, and etc., but I think it's very
important. I wrote it for you to read in the first place and
have pried the unusual channels chocked with red tape. Now, I'm 
doing a wrong wicked thing in saying here's anything you ought
to read.

     I'm not applying for the Radio Fellowship as everybody
seems to feel. I don't think I'm qualified and I'd rather stick
to my folklore for the moment, but I do feel that creative research
unit with the folklore bias can do the best propaganda
job for Defense Council and can of course, furnish leads of materials
for your writers. I've discussed the whole thing with Evans at
some length and he has asked me for some practical estimates for
presentation to the Defense Council people - all very tentative.
I've also prepared outlines for four song books for conscription
camps. Copies of these are enclosed.

     The reason for this letter is that I'm concerned about the
urgency of the present situation and lie awake nights with it.
I imagine you are too, even in Conway, and I feel therefore justified
in going over heads and if necessary crawling over hedges to
get this notion to you. The section of the Radio Project was
included as one series of examples, and that only, to the generalizations 
contained in the introductory pages.

With best wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
