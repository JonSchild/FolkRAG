RUMORS. August 10 - 15, 1942
DRAFT

"As soon as the elections are out of the way, the eighteen year olds will
be drafted."
"Young men who are about to be inducted are resorting to dope, maiming
themselves, and other methods of preventing themselves serving in the armed
forces."
In a discussion of the draft boards and their lack of uniformity in
classifying men, one man said that he had heard that in some rural sections
in the State of Michigan that if a man had $500 in cash, he wasn't classified
1A, and that besides outright bribery, if pressure was brought to bear on the 
board, men were deferred or classified so that immediate service was not necessary.
"If a married man lives in a district where there are many single men, he
does not have as much chance of being drafted as one who lives in a district
where there are fewer single men."
"All married men without children will be inducted into the Army after
the November election."

JEWS

"Bernard Baruch, along with the rest of the Jews, is now running the
country. Frances Perkins is a Russian Jewess and is close to Baruch."
"It's no wonder that we're in this war. Felix Frankfurter has been the
power behind the throne here for years and is now trying to tell England what
she can and cannot do. What right does he have to be in American politics
at all - everyone knows that he's a foreigner."
"We are just fighting anyway to give the Jews the control of this country."
"Jews are getting all the soft jobs from the government. All the inspectors
and time keepers in war production industries are Jews."
"Practically all of the doctors on the draft boards are Jewish."
"The number of Jews holding government jobs in Washington is out of
proportion."
"Jews have entered the factory field for the first time in New York in
order to avoid military service." (New York)

NEGROES

"Draft boards are not passing Negroes, because they are not wanted in the
army."
"Negroes in the army are not well treated in Australia, no decent living
quarters provided."
"Camp Custer is black with Negroes. The Army is moving colored soldiers
up here from the South now and intends to make Custer an all Negro camp."
"The Brightmoor Housing project is going to take Negro tenants. Some of 
the neighboring residents have made arrangements to sell their homes or move to
other localities."
"When this war is over the Negroes will be set back where they belong.
They are getting entirely too "uppity." They are even trying to take over Belle
Isle Park and keep all white people out."

PRODUCTION OF WAR MATERIALS. LABOR RELATIONS.

"The Ford bomber plant is putting out a bomber an hour. They are equipped
with bombs and sent at once to Europe."
