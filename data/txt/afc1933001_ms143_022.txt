My dear Dr. Stevens:

You may recall that in a chat with you at your office,
early in January, I outlined to you a project for the utilization,
in the general interest, of the records (especially the disks) con-
stituting our Archive of American Folk Song, and I left with you a 
copy of the program which we had submitted to the Carnegie Corpora-
tion embodying a budget totaling $39,500. I added that, while the 
merit of it seemed to appeal, there was hesitation on the part of
the Carnegie Corporation because of the size of the amount required;
and I asked whether it might be possible for the Rockefeller Foun-
dation, which had already shown interest in such subject matter,
to cooperate by contributing a portion of the sum required: suggest-
ing that it might consist in either one of the two groups of antici-
pated expenditure, viz: $15,000 for the plant and a three-year grant
($8,000 per annum) for the desirable personnel. The amount for the 
plant is of course small. THat for the personnel, on the other
hand, would be only an annual sum extending over three years.

You of course made no immediate coment on the program or
the subdivision of the expense. May I now ask whether I could
warrantably submit a formal application for it?

Very sincerely yours,

Librarian
