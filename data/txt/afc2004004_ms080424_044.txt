(Ray) doubt, well the man was in timber, right thru here where 
I lived. And this is a ginseng hollow. (?) I know the huntin' 
it, at one time, right thru here, up to them cliffs, you could a 
duck, probably, 5 to 25 pound every fall. Green, and then that 
would dry, about, .....6 or 7 pounds dry, it loses that much. 
And so this hollow I feel (?), the gatherin' it in the fungus, 
in the fungus of the soil that I was give a talent from my Creator, 
to know the soil, and the other people follows me. They learn 
they find more (seng? ) when they run behind Ray in the forest. 
And then a runnin' alone they see it before I do, I'm a lookin' at 
the soil. So when I see it, you can look for (seng?) , (unint.) 
a lady's slipper, and all that kind of stuff that grows in a non - 
it's not a non' but I call it a non-acid soil,...It's a pulverized 
mountain soil on the northwest side where the sugar trees....and 
Lynn, we call it, and White Maple, and all, and chesnuts, when it 
grows, the stump showed you it(?), showed you that that was a good 
'seng place that way. Well so now them older people, my grandfather, 
he got down there and worked all day, 14 hours from sun up 
to sun down. And this mill rightdown here, I got to see it, boy 
that was wonderful! It run with wood splines!...that the people 
invented in the mountains...Took a wheel piece this way and they 
drilled, cut in, and put in a (unint.) of spikes. And then they
took two other wheels and bored thru this way and put in round 
staff poles, about that long for this other spline to hook in. 
And that was the first mill that was invented, to grind the corn. 
The corn, to save, grind it like the Indians. Now I got a piece 
of rock in there I'd like to show you if you don't let me forget 
it, where the Indians grind their corn with a lot of stones. I've 
got it in there to prove it!
