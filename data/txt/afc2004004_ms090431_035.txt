Fisk, 1[2]1. 12

You know, I never did like no travellin pick.
That's all it need hyar..
Itâ€™s killin me, buddy.
It's killin me, boy.

Lean on, come now.
We can't count on none but next job.
All in one day, buddy.
All in one day, boy.

We can't count on none but next job
All in one day buddy,
All in one day, boy ..

This captain is killin me, boy.
Is killin me, boy
Say, get that thing a little down there.
[W](Why don't yo u get on up there?)
I could, but I takin that easy that time.
All right.

(But I'm behind ya)
How you like it? (That's all right)
Give em quick..
(Move on. Take that a little bit)
(All right)  (Go ahead)
