Mr. Herbert Rollins
12 Scott Street,
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Herbert:

I am leaving on another field trip to the 
Lake States this Friday. I will probably be in New York 
for 3 or 4 days, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and
can be reached there through the Presto Recording Co.,
139 West 19th street, New York City.

I wish you could come down from Cambridge for a 
day or two because I don't see how I can take the time from 
what is left of the summer to drop by Cambridge. If you 
cannot perhaps I will be able to go to Boston on my way 
home in October. Last April I called at your house in 
Pittsburg at four o'clock in the morning to discover that 
your family had moved to Atlantic City. The funny thing 
was that the people there were still up when I arrived 
and when I looked through the window I saw a round dirty-green
hat exactly like the one I remember you wearing. I 
was sure that you had just gotten home from Boston and 
could hardly believe my ears when I found out that the 
people had never heard of you.

Please communicate to me your plans, prospects,
and adventures, past, immediate, present and future.
213- B. street N. E. 'til Friday,

Yours
Alan
