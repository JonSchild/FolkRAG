Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thanks for your very nice letter of January 17. I really
do not mind your grumbling. In fact, I sort of miss it and
that may be one of the reasons for my trying to bring you up
here!

I have not yet recommended your trip to the Library because
I need still more information. You remember we spoke of your
staying here to document the records you made and to do some
singing yourself. At that time, you said something about the
necessity for a per diem allowance while you are here. Please
let me know frankly what you will need per day and about how
long it will take to complete the job. I should like to present
the complete project to Mr. MacLeish rather than a series of
separate recommendations.

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S. Have you sent Alan a list of the records you went duplicated
for your demonstration set.
