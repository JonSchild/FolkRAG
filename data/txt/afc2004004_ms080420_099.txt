TAPE:  Roll 27 p. 2
(AL) take on an American color, the way the people did.  There
are some old things here, there are some old expressions in the
language that go right back to the British Isles, but there are
all sorts of new things in the speech, in the songs, in the people.
It grew out of the life here, and right at the beginning of the
American time is the people that helped to defeat the British, and
the American Revolution, their ancestors.  They're the people who
cleared this country and first pulled over the Appalachians and
peaked on the other side, to see what it was gonna be like goin'
west; and in the process they became, in a way, really the first
Americanized Americans.  Their culture is somthing that is in
our very hearts.  Their banjo-playing, and their tunes, and their
way of thinking is now clearly the stuff for us all to grow from.
We're gonna have a mighty good time on Dellin Norton's front porch
here in Sodom -- is that right? -- a wicked place in a way, and a 
beautiful place in another way. . .
Martha:  When you start out, you better not look back, you may turn

Sheila:  (plays banjo) (sings):  "I know Donna, please say that you'll
