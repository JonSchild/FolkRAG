"Yabbadabbadeedadum"

Bessie and 'Bill Rolling Pin' Delight the Kids
By Martha Abshire
Citizen-Times Staff Writer

    The children had sparkles in
their eyes that were more 
than a hundred years old.
    Their laughter, the sound of
the tambourine, the chanting
voices that echoed through the
Asheville Junction coffeehouse
Saturday afternoon weren't
original.
    As 73-year-old Bessie Jones
got the crowd moving with
"Yabbadabbadeedadum," it
was with a spirit passed down
to her from her grandfather's 
slave days.
    "Now here's another old-
time slave song," she told the
mostly pint-sized audience at
the special children's concert,
"that my grandfather told to
me.
    "Way back then you couldn't
go from this place here to over
there without a permit," she 
said gesturing. The children on
each side of the huge room at
the Allen Center suddenly
looked rather trapped.
    "You couldn't go from one
Plantation to another one to go
visit and tell somebody 
something.
    "There was a man that went
from place to place watchin'.
He carried a big stick like a 
baseball bat. And they named 
him Bill Rolling Pin."
    With eyes wide, and stum-
bling verse, the close to 100
children formed mimicking
first and rotated them. With a
little imagination, they were
on Bill's horse.
    "Up the road and back
again," went the song, and the
children were right there with
him, in Dawson, Georgia, her
grandfather's territory, or in
any of a thousand other places
in the South.
    The children may not have
understood that the sprightly
woman before them was 
sharing history with them.
    They were too involved in
the embarrassment, and proud
confusion of being "chose" to
demonstrate the games.
    They didn't know that a sec-
ond woman, before them "Sis-
ter (Bessie) Burke, " was also
from slave family.
    "You helpin' 'em Sister
Bessie?" Mrs. Jones asked.
    Or that the third leader,
Vernell Pennington, is also
among the 27 members of the
Georgia Sea Island Singers.
The three were featured,
particularly Bessie Jones, at
the coffeehouse for Friday and
Saturday night concerts and 
the Saturday afternoon special
performance for children.
    When home, the group can
sometimes be found on old
slavegrounds on St. Simon's
Island: "Walk in Jerusalem, "
"Just Like John," and the 
inevitable "Saints Go 
Marching In" rising above the
firelight.
    Bessie "came up singing,"
she said. All it took were 
grandparents and children and
the games, riddles and songs
started. When it got dark, they 
build a fire in the yard and 
kept going.
For a long time, Bessie's
singing was primarily "just
me rememberin' "singing to
herself, or in churches and
special performances around 
the island.
    "About 33 years ago," she
started traveling away from
St. Simon's. Hometown con-
certs include local hotels, a
pattern after her being called
in former days, "sing for the
white folks" in the big tourist
hotel on the island.
    She now "goes where they
call me," which has meant a 
concert with Pete Seeger and 
Judy Collins, several trips to
Canada and Mexico for the 
summer Olympics.
    Wherever she goes, she 
brings with her the strength of
a culture still moving.
    Bessie's great-great-
granddaughter slept during
most of the concert Saturday.
But the mother of the year-
and-four-month old Patrice
was singing and laughing as
enthusiastically as anyone.
    "I really enjoy this," said
great-granddaughter Patricia
Wise. "Those were my people
too. I like to know what she
did, the stories of the older
days."
    "This is a carrying on," said
Bessie Burke, "so this
generation can learn."
    As Vernell Pennington in-
troduced Bessie Jones she told 
the children that slaves came
in wherever there was water.
She told them that they were
from St. Simon's Island, part
of the Sea Islands off the coast
of Georgia.
    Bessie's grandfather was a 
slave, she said, and Bessie
played the same games when
she was "your size" that
"she's going to teach you,"
she said.
    "We're going to take you all
the way back to the beginning,
and it's going to feel good."
    Bessie then told the children
that only a few could play at
a time and warned them not to
laugh at "the other ones"
when they were up playing
because "we're all funny."
    She introduced "Yab-
badabbadeedadum," (the
sound a squirrel makes when
it runs through a pile of 
leaves,) a song she said she
made up, with Harry
Belafonte's help.
    Rhythmically she said the
word. The young voices
echoed in her resonance, in
higher ranges. Then she
started swaying. The syllables
took on lives of their own.
    She closed her eyes. The
chant began to take on a bit of
music. Her tambourine
reached for her side, then
bounced back for more.
    By the time the song ended,
the crowd had broken out in
community smiles.
    She then stepped gingerly
off the state for "Bill Rolling
Pin," warning Vernell to be 
careful about helping 
her down, "I'm ticklish. The
reason I'm ticklish I had three
broken ribs. I ain't been to a
doctor since 1924."
    The children then gathered
into squares for a hilariously
disastrous "Go Under Sister
Sally."
    "This is an old slave game
from Dawson, Ga." Bessie
told them, as they shyly
looked over the people beside
them, and carefully held
hands. "Back then the black
people had to draw the water
from the wells."
    "All the white people's wells
was covered up, under their 
porches and things. But not
black people's. Frogs got in
there, and lots of other things.
Eveythin' came out with that
water. But we're still livin'.
    "Everybody say for me,
'draw me a bucket of water,' 
now 'for my oldest daughter.'
"As the crowd stumbingly
echoed, "Don't say it proper,
say it flat as I'm saying it."
    Because they were carefully
shown before the song started
how arms crossed in the 
middle were to end up on the 
outside of the group, miscued
"goings under" began to sort
of happen whenever giggles
warranted.
    But the game stayed semi-
together, until Bessie sur-
prised them with "a frog in
the bucket and can't get 'em
out," and started frantically
shuffling her feet.
    When everybody else started
shuffling, it got to be just too
funny. They went back to their
seats exhausted, eagerly
waiting the next game.
    In another week, an album
of her songs, "So Glad I'm 
Here" will be cut by Rounder
Records.
