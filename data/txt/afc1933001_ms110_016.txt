I did a little scouting work for you yesterday
when of the several hitch hikers picked up
one proved to have ballad possibilities. He
is 80 odd years old, an ex-slave, born in Houston
County, Texas, one (Candy) Bill Wyatt, not the
clown of Georgetown. He has a collection of
varmints which perform with bells to the leadership
of the old man, who dresses in one of several
gaudy uniforms. The old man had been entertaining
some soldiers in Temple and had with him
his pet skunk, from which, he chucklingly stated,
had been removed it's "credentials or degree".
His memory is impaired, but he does know some old
and non-religious songs, some of which he has written
out and some others he will write pending a visit
from you. One starts like this with a good tune:

"I went up on the mounitng
And give my horn a blow,
And I think I heard my true love say
Yonder comes my beau." 

He reports that Sadie Jones, an old colored lady, there 
knows plenty of old songs.

If I didn't tell you in the last letter, Alan's
missive was appreciated. However, your admonition
to let this serve as an entering wedge of corresponden-
ce betwixt us fell on somewhat cynical ears. This
since, in my honest memory, it was the first letter
he had writ me since August, 1937 during which
I had aimed several but eschewed tendrils at him.

Your brief case with manuscripts was seen
safely on your desk by my eyes.

I enclose a letter from my Atlanta friend,
and I think a week-end trip to South Georgia as
she plans would certainly be worth the effort in 
many ways. 

You affectionate son,

John
