Roberts: Oh, I just picked it up aboard a ship, that's all.
Lomax: When?
Roberts: When I was about fifteen, 
Lomax: Who sang it to you?
Roberts: O the mate standing at the wheel so that I
couldn't sleep. (Pause.) You want me to sing
something else? I though you'd got that one.
You want me to sing it all over again.
1)  Twere once I had an Irish girl, but she was fat and lazy,
Away, haul away, we'll haul away, Joe!
And now I got a Suffolk girl, she drives me nearly crazy,
Away, haul away, we'll haul away, Joe!
2)  For girls were made to love and kiss, or so me mother told me,
And if I did not kiss the girls my lips they'd grow a-mouldy.
3) King Louis was the King of France beforethe Revolution,
King Louis got his head cut off and spoilt his constitution.
4) Away, haul away, we'll haul along the bowline,
Away, haul away, the packet she's a rolling,
5) Away haul away, we'll hang and haul together,
Away haul away, we'll haul away, Joe!
Lomax: Did you learn that on board ship, too, Bob?
Roberts: Yes, donkeys years ago.
Lomax: That's one of the best of all the tunes.
Roberts: I don't know.
Lomax: What about this one about Mary Anne? You sang it in
the bar.
Roberts: That's a local song - Maggie May. Butterman's Bay's
out here.
