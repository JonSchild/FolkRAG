Dear Mr. Lomax:

   I am enclosing a note from
Mr. Peter Bowers who ordered the recordings to
which you refer in your letter of January 22,
and asked us to forward to you the bill for
$23.30 dated January 8.

   I hope that his has not caused you
any inconvenience, and that his explanation will
suffice.  When making your remittance will you
please make it payable to:
   MARVIN ROTHENBERG, Treas.

   Present critical conditions have
put the entire radio and recording business on
a strictly cash basis if one is to obtain materials.
Therefore we would deeply appreciate an
early reply.
   
   If any difficulty still remains, will
you please let me know by return mail.

Sincerely yours,
[*Harold L. Friedman*]
Harold L. Friedman
Vice-President
