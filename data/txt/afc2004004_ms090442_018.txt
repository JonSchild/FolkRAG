Fisk, 9. 12.

Brother and the Pop on the R. C. line.

Casey Jones was a man, you know,
Who loves good times; he's always have good dough.
All you farmers should be like me.
I have a good-looking woman that you call Jane Bee.

Casey Jones was a might good engineer.
Casey Jones was a man, you know.

Levee Camp Holler.
Will Stark.

I've got something to tell you,
Before I go, I go.
Put on your blankets,
Put on your robes.
We're gonna have a stand with the life in goes.
Oh, Lord, brfore I go.

The home spring brackets,
And the camp's cryin, the camp's cryin.
The women in the levee camp hollerin
"That man is mine;
Oh, Lord, this man is mine."

You can't do me
Like you done Paul Shine--
Work him on the levee
Til he went sone blind,
Til he went stone blind.

I heard a mighty racket,
But didn't see no trains.
It must have been my boss
Legging his money chains.

A: Wel, what else do you -- put on Bud Doggett.

S: All right.

Bud Doggett.
Will Stark.

Come, all you sorry bootleggers,
And listen to me.
I have a little example
I want you to see.

It's better to hit your maw
Or hit your paw,
Than try to run liquor
Under the new Jones Law.

Mr, Ferd, Mr. Chapman
arries too big a gun,
And he'll shoot any bootleggers
That breaks and run.
