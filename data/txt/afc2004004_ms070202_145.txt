Haitian Folk-Lore

[Obscure countries, like obscure, people]

Small countries, like small people, make news when they are visited 
by death. The other day Haiti made news when between eight and twelve thousand 
Haitians were slaughtered in San Domingo. [Later] After [this] the [naked the]
[corpses] bodies were safely underground, the [diplomats got together and] Haitians & Dominican governments 
estimated what this lot dead Haitians would come to. They finally decided 
on $80,000. That makes a common, ordinary, garden variety Haitian worth 
[ab] in the neighborhood of $10. What an upper class, educated and refined 
Haitian is worth [y] has not been determined since none of them were killed. 
[Some of the] One of the reasons that lower-class [One reason that the estimate was] Haitians [were] are [estimated to be] so
[so] inexpensive [was] is that is that they are generally [known presumed] supposed to be dirty, /illiterate, [stupid]
uncivilized and full of disease. [Besides this] They are [known] known to practice 
a barbaric[, bloody], African religion [e]--- Voodoo, and said to indulge [at all times]
in orgiastic rites. [Besides this they are Negros, their skins are black. In] Some or all of this is urged as an excuse for the above hargain. 
[In the course in the course of this talk I should like hope plan to supply material]
[in terms of records, pictures and my own the impressions of four month's stay on the island, which, will, I hope]
[make some of these presumptions a li much less acceptable.]
