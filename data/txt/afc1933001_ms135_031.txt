Dear Mr. Middleton:
John A. Lomax is at present in Europe and so I am answering your letter before I forward it to him. He is no longer in charge of folk lore of the the Writer's Project, Mr. G. A. Botkin now holds that position and I suggest that you write him for additional information. Your thesis project is quite suggestive and I should like, for my own sake, to be able to look into it more thoroughly than I can now. I am leaving in a few days for a summer field trip and will not be able to do more than make a suggestion or so before fall.
Last summer I recorded a fragmentary version of "Harvey Logan in Kentucky" (enclosed) and I forward it with the stipulation that it will not appear in print before the publication of American ballads and Folksongs no. 2 to appear in 1939. As for the other ballads, I am afraid I can furnish you no information at the moment although next fall I might be able to find some material. There is  a whole category of BadmMan ballads that you have neglected and that allow for historical treatment more easily than any other group of indigenous narrative songs. I refer to the feud ballads of Kentucky and Tennessee, the 'Rowan County Crew', the 'Vance Song' and others. You can find a number of these in Cox. I should like to hear more of your project as it advances and will be happy to cooperate in any way I can.
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge
