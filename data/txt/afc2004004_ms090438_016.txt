Boll Weevil-- Sid Hemphill
I'm gonna sing you something,
The latest of my own,
Sing you about the boll weevil
Is trying to take our home,
Ain't got no home,
Ain't got no home.
Well, the farmer went to the merchant,
"Merchant , I'll tell you a fact,
I'll catch and kill a boll weevil
Will you give me a Steson Hat-- ?
I'll have a time, I'll have a time."
That farmer cotch a boll weevil,
And he roll him in the sand,
When he seen him that morning
He was actin like a man,
He's havin a time, he's havin a time.
That farmer went back to the merchant
"Merchant, I'll tell you a certainly fact--
Best way to kill a boll weevil
Well, gimme a cotton sack.,
I'll have a time, I'll have a time."
Then the farmer went to the merchant,
"Merchant, I won't have no mo,
Done et up all my cotton,
Done started on my corn."
That Farmer say, "Now, Boll Weevil,
You are doing him wrong,
Eatin up all of his cotton,
And startin on his corn."
The farmer went to the boll weevil,
Says, "Boll Weevil, where in the world your home?"
"I stays over in Texas,
Won't be here very long,
Got to have a time,
Got to have a time.
That farmer went out in the field one mornin
That boll weevil 's flyin in the air,
Weent out there this evenin,
Done moved his family there,
Havein a time, havein a time..
That farmer says, "Boll weevil,
What are you tryin to do?"
"I'm tryin to carry six rows,
And My children all carryin two."
Farmer say, "Boll Weevil,
I thought I buried you in the sand?"
