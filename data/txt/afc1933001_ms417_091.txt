What to do about it? UNION. I am a union man, I am a union
woman now. They tell us to wait, but we had that old hungry feeling
so long that we tell 'em they know what they can do, 'cause the
workers are a-moving, and ain't nothing stopping them. We tell we
hate their capitalist system, and say, come on friends, and lets
go down, down to that picket line. What do you say to the scabs?
Come all you hardy miners! Which side are you are on? There is no
neutral there; you'll either be a union man or a thug for J H Blair

All this resulted in the fact that we demanded that our government
stop being a rich man's government. So we got the New Deal. We
thought we'd got it for good, but there was a reshuffle. But then
we were sure all glad then. Roosevelt said, stand up and dry your
tears, you've had Willie Hoover for four long years. We sang
all the songs we could think of, we were so happy about the CWA,
the TVA; but what's happened now. Somehow, something never broke
through, and I'm still looking for that New Deal now. I'm still
waitin' on Roosevelt.

But the New Deal did one thing; it started a new wave of unionism
that spread from coast to coast. We went on strike, and we sung on
the picket line. We sang on picket lines around the Aluminum Co[unty]mpan
the shirt factory, the Blue Bell factory, in Birmingham, in Roane
County, in Marion, across a thousand miles or ocean. We said, it
ain't gonna work no more, no more. You bosses are gonna have to
pay up. It's write me out my union cars, for you guys got to get
organized. Knuts to Knudsen and slush to Sloan; sit down!

And by george, look over your shoulder back there: the farmer
are gettin' together too! Ten little union men became ten million.
They said, there is mean things happenin' in this land, and raggedy
raggedy are we, and Landlord, what in hell is the matter with you?
It's roll the union on.

So what's the situation now, U S A, 19 and 40, Anno Dommini ? 
The dustbowlers don't like the way they been blowed aroun'. 
East, west, old, and young. We're speaking our mind; we're
singing our mind.
We just see that we ain't got no stake over in that war. A fool
