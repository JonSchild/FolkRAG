Dear Alan:

You'd better see Mr. Spivacke
about the enclosed letter which came
a few moments ago.

If the work impressed Livingston
he deferred until next Spring,
I can either return the recording
machine at once or go on to
San Antonio, the Texas coast and to
the Southern region of Louisiana
pointed out by you. After making
these recordings I am sure that
I can pick up good stuff here
in Deep Ellum through Mike.
I have in mind also our trip
up Amarillo way to pick
up more cattle calls. This
use may or may not justify
