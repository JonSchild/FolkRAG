any case. I remember that you came to Denver following a letter from me, and I hope that what I say now will have a similarceffect.  I can hope, can't I?

               In any case, Marion and I both send you and Mrs. Lomax our best wishes and look forward to seeing you whenever and wherever we soonest can.  I regret the delay between your letter and this answer which will not happen again. This letter is, of course, a personal one and I shall not mention acquisition of your material with Dr. Spivacke or Luther Evans. In which event, I feel that the Library should approach you, recognising on its part what you have done for America.
                 Again, my best wishes.
