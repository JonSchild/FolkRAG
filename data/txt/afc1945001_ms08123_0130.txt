An Anecdote

Only five men were left on the small boat.
Their ship had been sunk by a German submarine.
Their supplies were almost out and the fact that
they would have to endure hunger was more than
they could bear.  The water was full of crocodiles.
They tried and tried to catch one.  Finally when they
realized it was impossible to kill a crocodile one of the
mates shouted," Let him go.  These thing have too many
legs.  See, He hasn't even put his front legs down!"

Wife:  "I shall try to manage with only 6 pairs
of shoes this year."
Friend:  What is your husband going to wear to work?"

Barber:  "Haven't I shaved you before, sir?"
Soldier:  "Nope, I got that scar at Pearl Harbor."

Neighbor:  "Nice little wedding wasn't it?"
Friend:  "Yes, and do you know, the bride's father gave
them a pound of butter to start with.
