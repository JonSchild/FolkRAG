October (?) 1934
Letter from JAL to RTL
From Little Rock, Arkansas
--------- The party was a great success, with Leadbelly
singing and me interpolating. Again Johnny told me that he was proud
of em. Leadbelly is shouting happy over his clothes. Johnny gave him
some too. (Note: "The party" was given in a hotel for John A. Lomax,
Jr.'s friends of RFC accountants who happened to be stationed in L.R.)
Yesterday and the day before we had in our cabin two street
corner singers, Blind Pete and George Ryan: 5 songs, four new and one
an interesting variant. After another session with Blind Pete this
morning we drive to Tucker, thirty miles away, to see the penetentiary
officials. The main Negro farm is 60 miles distant. If things work well
Leadbelly will drive back Saturday afternoon for Johnny who wishes to
ramble with us Saturday afternoon and Sunday.
