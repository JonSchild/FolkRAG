[*DRINKING - EFFECT ON PERSONALITY*]

         I think some to myse'f like I feel like I look like I 
knew how, hah!  Yeah.
TL:    What do you think about music, Bessie?  In the parties you
were at, did the music get better as the people got drunker?
BJ:    Hum-um, I don' reckon it did. . .But I guess it got better to
them, you know.   Yeah, Lawd.  They look like it's real -- You know,
lot a peoples just has ta -- has ta have sumpin' to make them
happy.   But even when, ah, ah, the lil' drinkin' that I did do,
ah, I'd git, I'd git happy with music, without [a] any drink, ya know?
I [wasn-- 'c] reckon 's because I jus' liked music.  That's right.
I would hear music, oh, workin' in the field.  I would stop an'
listen, I didn' -- hah -- yeah, an' I guess it's jus' a, jus' attrack
me somehow or other.  I jus' like music.  So tha's why.  I, I. . .
          But lot a folks, ah, they is dead as don't know what until
they -- you know, don't care what kinda music, they'll lay there
an' sleep on ya.  You gi' 'em a drink, then they git up an', an'
best ya kickin'!  Ha, ha, ha!   But that's jus' the way it -- jus'
the diffrunt (difference) in peoples, diffrunt in the raisin'
of 'em. (?)  Everybody ain't jus' alike, no way, shape nor form.
         I, I ar, like to see peoples happy with anything they do;
even if they drink, ah, let 'em be merry with it, not mad with
it.
TL:    Were there all kinds of drunks that you
BJ:    Well, all kinda drunks yet.  You meet 'em right down there in
the street.   You be scared to meet some of 'em; you know they
ain't doin' right.  Tha's right.   We met a man yesterday, I an'
I an' um, Dena.  An' he had his hand stretched out, "Aww-aww, aww-aww."
He looked like he tryin' ta                 bof of us up
this way, that way.  "Aww, aww."  I walked around there with Dena.
