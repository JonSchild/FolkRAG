I heard of a woman buying 75 ships.

I heard also that they were rationing
things to keep the people from spending
their money like they want to, and 
not because of their distributing to every
source so one will not have more than
the other and that.

Rationing was stupidity. Also
Some said they did not believe we
should help the other countries such
as Greek relief and English & etc.
