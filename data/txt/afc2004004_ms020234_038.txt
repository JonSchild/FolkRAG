BJ TAPE 20, p. 35

        I mean when I, I, I ain't had just a husband.   I had some
good guys between husbands.  An', you know, I mean some good ones.
I mean.  An' some good breaks.   But if I -- If they don't
know nothin', I can go around today and tomorrow, if I was to
see 'em, they'd be marries or livin' or dead...ah, you know what
I mean?   If I had to meet 'em, I'd meet 'em in peace.    'Cause I
didn't -- I didn't give 'em no trouble.   'Cause I'm afraid to do
them things.  An' if I walk away an' leave ['em] one, it ain't about no
woman -- I mean about no man...[No]Y'know...'Cause I mean --'Cause I
wasn't there to stay, nohow.   Not me.   'Cause I ain't never had
no, nothin' stationary, to stay, you know, with my man proposition.
          ['Cause] But I let a man go in a hurry.   I, I just think (?) I
ain't got to go do it.  As, as long as I'm workin'.   An' an' I believe
that if I pass workin', I tell 'em to send me to the poorhouse,
see?   Send me to the poorhouse if I pass workin'.   Or doin'
anything for myself.
[*CARE OF THE AGED (ATTITUDES)*]
           So therefore I don't have to be worried.   They ain't -- I
ain't knucklin to a man.   But a lot of folks feel like an' look
like they think they knuckle to 'em.    But they feel that way,
that's them...That's them; that's the way they feel.   They feel
that way they just knuckle to a woman.  That's them.   I can't
he'p [it] that.  They, they can say what they wanna say [but I] about me,
like a hint (?).   I just ain't knuckle.   If I -- Long as (I')m able
to work an' able to go out, that little...lil' bit I make'll take
care  a me, so far.  An' if I git he'pless an' cain't do nothin'
for myse'f an' ain't got 'nough money to go to th' hospital or
go to nothin' or charity ward or whatnot, charity or sumpin' will
take care a me.   You know?    Somebody gonna take care a me.  Because
I done the best I could, an' God's gonna open a way.  Ya see.
