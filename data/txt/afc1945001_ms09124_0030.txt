"America's War"

Today's war has not affected the
people of America as much as it has
the people of other countries at war.
England has been bomb many
time. The Germans have taken over
France, are fighting in Russia
and have taken many small countries.

The American people are very lucky
to have such a wonderful country. We have
not been bombed and have no German
soldiers walking around in our country.

The United States army and navy
are the best fed and highest payed in
the world.
