Last night just before bed I was looking at Archer Taylor's book
book on the proverb.  On the first page he explained that he
would like to [have] define the proverb,  but that was practicall
impossible.  The essence of the proverb,  he said,  was
incommunicable. Much,  therefore,  as I 
would like to begin this seminar with a definition of folk-lore
I [should] shall accept Archer Taylor's hint that the essence of
the thing is mysterious and incommunicable. 
Shall we say that folk lore is what folk lorists have made it? 
Then For the moment,  let us assume that folk-lore is whatever
folk-lorists x have been interested to call folklore,  for [cert]
certainly they must be [acquainted]  best acquainted with this
quality of that is incommunicable,  must be able to recognize
it.  Let us then begin with a description of the folk lorist,
himself.
