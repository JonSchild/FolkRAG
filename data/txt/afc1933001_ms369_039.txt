Sharpe----3.
Certain number of vulgar songs Sharpe believes are not 
communal but individual productions. Verdict of community against them,
"because they are bad, vicious and indefensible."
Chap ix.
Interesting notes on ways of folk-singers.
"When I were young I used to dance thicky song, but I be too old
now."
". . . . the popular songs of the towns have always been sung to a limited
extent by folk-singers, side by side with their own songs; though none
of the former, apparently, have succeeded in obtaining a permanent
resting-place in their affections." (111)
"It would be very hard in the art-music up to the end of the 16th century
to find a single tune that was wholly the composition of a
professed musician." (112)
"The peasant singers would natyrally prefer their own songs as they
had themselves fashioned them, to the forms in which they came down to them
from the hands of professional musicians." (115)
Chap. x. 
I wonder if Sharpe, in deriving all his songs from old people, did not
record old folks' tunes, much colored by age; thus he would
naturally supposed that there is a great recent decline in folksinging?
Tunes were preserved in folk-memory, while words were corrupted by broad-
side versions; the pedlars, who memorized them in country, recited garbled
versions to the city printers; then, too oftentimes on a broadside a modern set of words was substituted for the more authentic ones.
P. 126. Folk probably invented modes; great majority of f. songs sung in
modes. Therefore, no sign of age. "If it is beautiful, it needs nothing
to recommend it. If it is not beautiful, declaring it to be as old as
Moses will not make it so."
