you, they punish you, sometimes we stay about a half a day,
we didn't say a word.
AL:  Of any kind, English or French.
Octa:  Well, we couldn't talk English, we can't talk French, so
we stay there until we have achance to hide somewhere and
talk French a little bit.  But they had someone to guard and
watch us, bring to the teacher, you know.  Oh, we had a hard
time.  No, no, I stopped school.  I don't wanna go to school
for nothing.  My daddy said, if you don't want to go to school
you need to work.  I'd say give me a pair of mules.  Idon't
want to go to school, so he gave me a pair of mules, and he
give me the work too.
AL:  But you could talk French to the mules, couldn't you?
How do you say whoa in French.
Octa:  Just the same, and go, and get up, we say come up here 
AL:  You never did sing to your mules, did you?
Octa:  No, we didn't have time, we got to work in the back.
