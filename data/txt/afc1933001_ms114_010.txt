I have been working on some more lessons for Daddy for those
others that I did got such a high grade that he wants me to
do as many as I can.
                      
Please try your best to be of no trouble to Tommy
and Deanie and love them both very much for me and for you
too every time you can catch one of them. Mother is very
lonely and sad away from her big girl and one of these days
I will be coming back, save plenty of loving for me,

Mother
