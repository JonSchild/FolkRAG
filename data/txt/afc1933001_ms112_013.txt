Dear Father
Thanks for your letter of the 
6th.  We wish very mucho go to Corpus with
you.  However, we are honor guests at a party this 
Saturday, and, therefore, much prefer the weekend
of the 20-22.  If this suits you, come on down any time
next week for a visit with us, and we'll go on as 
soon as we're able.  But if it must be this week,
say so by return mail, and we'll do what we can. 
Have tried all day unsuccessfully
to locate Mr. Pincknay, but his Secy. thinks he 
will be here both weeks.  I'll talk with him and 
inform  you only if he's not to be here. 
Am glad your trip East turned
out all night. 
Your son, 
John
