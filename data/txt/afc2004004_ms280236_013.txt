Joe: Ain't it!
Lomax: Now tell me, why was the basin of blood lying there, anyway?
Joe: Don't know what was the cause of that.
Lomax: Was that part of his sickness?
Joe: I should say so, yes. Well, he was brokenhearted.
Lomax: Had he been wounded, or. . . .
Joe: No, no, no. . . .
Lomax: Do you know where this happened. . . .where did the story
of Barbara Allen happen?
Joe: No, I never did hear.
Lomax: Or how long ago it was ?
Joe: Oh a long while ago, you see -- that's an old song.
Lomax: Is it a true history?
Joe: Yes, that's atrue song, they reckon, you know.
Lomax: Well, who was at fault in the song?
Joe: Well, I couldn't say what was his side and what was her side.
You can't tell, can you?
Lomax: You don't know how the quarrel actually began?
Joe: No, I don't.
Lomax: But it seems to me she was an awful hard-hearted woman,
wasn't she?
Joe: Why, of course she was. Certianly so.
Lomax: Maybe she was too proud, or something.
Joe: Something like that, yes.
(He repeats first verse again on Lomax's request. Lomax then asks
if he knows various songs, with no results. Then straight into song.)
