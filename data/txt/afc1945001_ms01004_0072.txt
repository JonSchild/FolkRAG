TO:          Neil DuBois
FROM:     Don Bussey
SUBJECT:                                                 Rumor Study

                           In line with our telephone conversation this date, may
I suggest that the contemplated rumor study be geared to the proposition:
              
               that in an atmosphere of silence, that which is said may
               carry undue weight or influence.

                           A recent report by the Channels Division showed that
when the media are provided with inadequate information about the war
fronts, particularly with regard to our losses, they come to rely upon
enemy news sources.  Similarly, it may be possible through a rumor study,
to show that the circulation of rumor and the credence attached to rumor
is greatest in those areas where the Government is releasing little or
no information, or where the media are not bringing this information to
the attention of the public.

                           Accordingly, there would seem to be good justification
for bringing the Sources Division, the Channels Division, the Surveys
Division and the Polling Division into the rumor study in an effort to
establish the existence of this correlation or its absence.
                     
                         If the theoretical assumption that people will believe
anything within the limits defined by their 
preconceptions of the possible when they don't have enough information proves to be valid, it
might be possible to convince the military authorities that more adequate
information about military events is needed if rumor circulation is to be
prevented.
