Fisk, 1,2.

I [was] your servant , coming on anyhow.
Please have mercy.

O my father, [xxxxxxxxxxx]
Would you be so pleased To look upon us tonight
With an eye of pity. And smile on us.
Move back the dark cloud that hang heavy over our pathway.
Let your kindness shine in our midst.
Let us feel that we're your children and You's our father.
On our steady march to heaven and tomorrow's glory.
Please have mercy tonight, I pray thee.

My father, would you be so pleased
To bless these, your servants
To go into the far-off land for you,
My master, sing praises unto Thy name.
Please, my master, strengthen them, I pray thee,
Whilst going to and fro through the land
Would you be so pleased [as] to [raise] build a wall of protection around them.
Please guide them home, I pray for Jesus' sake.

Now, my father, when the victory is achieved in your name
And the Warfare is over,
Would you be so pleased as to [let me see thee] meet us somewhere in [my] a dying hour,
Accept us to Thyself, my father.
