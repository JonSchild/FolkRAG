Last Saturday night young Nancy lay sleeping, 
And into her bedroom young Johnny went creeping 
With his long fol-the-riddle-i-do right down to his knee. 

2) He said, "Lovely Nancy, may I cometo bed to you ?" (2) 
She smiled and replied, "John, I'm afraid you'll undo me." 

3) "My breeches fit tight, love, I cannot undo them." (2) 
She smiled and replied, "John, you must take your knife to them." 

4) My knife it won't cut, love, it ain't worth a cinder (2) 
She smiled and replied, "John, there's two on the window" 

5) He picked up the knife and he unlaced his breeches (2)

Lomax: What does a knife-mark in the window mean ? 

Cox: Buggered if I know! 

Lomax: What does it mean "pretune ?" 

Cox: Pretune ? Get rid of ! 
Lomax: No, but he said "he performed and she pretuned." 

Cox: Yes, well, I suppose she got herself ready. That's how I'd put 
it 

Lomax: She prepared herself ? 

Cox: Yes, like - pretuned. Yes, same thing I should think. 

Lomax: How would a woman prepare herself ? 

Cox: Pull all her gear out of the way ! 

Lomax: You haven't got another one coming up like that, have you ? 

1) It's of an old miser in London did dwell, 
He had one only daughter - such a beautiful girl, 
Five hundred bright guineas was her portion in gold 
Until she fell in love with a young sailor bold.
