recognizing the relation of rumor to morale in general, and the
undesirability of increasing anxiety around the focus of material which
in large measure is innocent.
        The following illustration [if very] is fairly good: It deals with a local
rumor [which] with answers in specific terms, including giving the reader an
orientation which will make it possible for him to handle future situations
which might otherwise cast doubt upon the continued truthfulness
of the current answer. Notice that it does not feel the need to
[encourage this] encumber this particular response with the official source of the information,
but relies, rather, upon the confidence the people have in the
column and newspaper for a fair report.

                "RUMOR--New York is full of English soldiers and
                sailors. All you have to do is walk around Times
                Square; it looks like more than you find in England.
                Brooklyn is full of them too. Why are so many
                soldiers here when our boys are being shipped
                across? And why aren't the sailors out with their
                ships instead of hanging around New York?
                "ANSWER--By a British official in New York--'There
                have been no British soldiers here since a detachment
                of about 200 passed through about eight months
                ago from a South America base--Cameron Highlanders
                and the King's Own Shropshire Light Infantry. The
                ones you see in khaki belong to maritime regiments
                and are assigned to merchant ships as Army gunners,
                to replace Navy gunners. They can be identified by
                an emblem on their right arm, an anchor and a 
                double 'A.' They are in and out of town constantly.
                "'The cadets, training for the RAF in the South under
                the Empire's air training scheme, are all being moved
                back to Great Britain.
                "'The British sailors quartered here at any one time
                are never more than a few thousand at most. They
                are: 1. Waiting for repairs on their warships; 2. 
                recently arrived on troopships to take back new
                vessels; and 3, shore-based naval attaches."
