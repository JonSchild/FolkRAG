     There was a "cocky" young Lieutenent
who, this particular day, was feeling
very, very superior. A buck private
passed without saluting. The Lt.
called him back & told him to salute
on hundred fifty. The young
private began the ordeal, when
a commanding officer, (a superior
of the Lt.) who was watching, came
& reminded the Lt. to return
every salute. When he left they
were still saluting.
