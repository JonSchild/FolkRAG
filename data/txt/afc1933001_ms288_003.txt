"...it must not be supposed as some philological pedagogues have supposed with the mincing inaccuracy that is usual in this kind of people that Old Catawba is today a magnificent anachronism populated with roistering and swash-buckling Elizabethans, 'singing' (the pedagogues gloatingly remark of the mountaineers) 'the very songs their ancestors sang in England four centuries ago, in a form that is practically intact' or with warlike and madeyed Celts chanting the same ballads as when they stormed across the border behind the Bruces.

"No.  The Catawban of today is not like this, nor would he want to be.  He is not a colonist, a settler, a transplanted European.  During his three centuries there in the wilderness he has become native to the immense and lonely land that he inhabits, during those three centuries he has taken on the sinew and color of that earth, he has acquired a character, history and tradition of his own:  it is an obscure history, unknown to the world and not to be found in the pages of books, but it is a magnificent history, full of heroism, endurance, and the immortal silence of the earth......"

The lords and ladies left their imprint on the land they helped to settle.  Their elegantly bloody histories in song were sung at firesides of pioneers throughout the country.  A prime favorite has always been "Barbara Allen", who slew her Sweet William with virginal cold heartedness and, suddenly surprised by love when she looked at his pale dead face, was smitten, herself, and died.

"Barbara was buried in the old church yard,
Sweet William buried nigh her,
And out of his grave grew a red, red rose,
And out of hers a briar."
