The Forster Family
Lauriun, Mich.

Dear Forster family and especially Abo Johyani:

You have not heard from me because I only got
back to town last Thursday and I can tell you that I
have been as lonely for you as you have been for me.
Everyone I saw in the rest of my trip I told about you
and how if they were to have a good time they should
come and see you. How long it will be before I can
come, I do not know just now. I have an awfully busy
winter before me and that means an equally busy spring.
There is a chance that I might dash out to Upper Peninsula
for New Years but t at is very unlikely. I am
awfully sorry to learn that the Yalmer has been ill and
I hope he is better by this time.

Don't forget me and as soon as I can I will
send you a record with everybody on it. Tell Abo that
his peppermints were really very effective and give
him my greeting in this sentence that I learned in
Minnesota "Ken kansa halveksu sortuvi niinkuin
jureton puu"

Sincerely, your friend
