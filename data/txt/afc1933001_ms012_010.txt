                     Again I repeat, I think you or Mr. Leland or Mr.
           Putnam are in a position to confer with The Carnegie
           Corporation and explain to them the situation. As
           for Mr. Stevens, representing The Rockefeller Foundation,
           you might also repeat to him my report of my
           conversation, in case I have failed to set out precisely
           what he said. I am deeply grateful to you,
           Mr. Engel, for your very great kindness to me. I
           feel sure that you have been kinder than you
           realize.

                                                       Sincerely yours,
                                                     John A. Lomax
                                                     JOHN A. LOMAX,
                                                     % Oscar Callaway,
                                                     Comanche, Texas.
