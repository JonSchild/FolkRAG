1. Gaelic Catechism.
2. Roger Esquire: Phil Tanner.
1) Young Roger Esquire came a-courting of late,
To a rich farmer's daughter, called beautiful Kate.
And she for her fortune had five thousand pounds,
With rich rings and jewels, with rich rings and jewels
And a piece of fine ground.

2) The daybeing appointed and the money laid down,
Was not that a fine fortune of Â£5000  ?
Young Roger he swore by his curly long hair
"I'll not wed your daughter (2)
With the grey mare."

3) Then up spoke her father and thus said he,
"I thought that you loved my daughter indeed.
But as I have got her thus far in my care,
You shall not have my daughter (2)
Nor yet the gray mare."

4) Twelve months being over and a little above,
Young Roger Esquire met Katey, his love.
Saying, "Katie, loving Katie, o don't you know me  ?"
"Such a man of your likeness I chance for to see..
Such a man of your likeness with curly long hair."
That once came a-courting (2) my father's grey mare."
5) Says Roger to Katie, "Them words I deny,
And the truth of the story I will on you try.
I thought that your father would have made no dispute
But to give me his daughter (2) and the gray mare to boot."

The Blaydon Races: Isla Cameron.
1) I went to Blaydon Races 'twas on thr 9th of June,
Eighteen hundred and seventy-two on a summer's afternoon,
I took a bus for Bangor and she was heavy laden,
We all went 'long Palmer Street, 'cause that's the road to Blaydon.

Chorus:
O me lads, you should ha' seen me ganging,
Passing the folks upon the road, just as they were standing,
All the lads and lasses there, all with smiling faces,
Ganging along the Scotswood Road, to see the Blaydon Races.
