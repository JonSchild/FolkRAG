LARRY:
I was just thinking of Brother Davis on the way out here, and I was thinking about how when I began to study out here, you know, the advise he gave me along the way, you know/  When I say a long the way I mean my first meeting up till now. How one day he told me, I was straining; and trying to learn this piece of music you know exactly like he was playing it, I forgot what it was now, but anyway, I don't think I'll ever learn it, that was the big thing and one day he saw me just straining and
straining and he says "Larry, he says "Listen, it won't help you to play just like I do, but it'll help you to keep me in mind" you know, and things like that meant I took a piece of music and started to play not like him, but just to play and it made so much a big difference.
