1 The Tinkers Wedding pg 535-6 - 
7-8 of a Book 'The Tinker-Gypsies ‘“
published by me, but now out 
of print.  I feel sure you will find 
it in any good Library or with a 
bit of luck in a good Second Hand 
Book shop.  Sung in farmhouses through 
out Galloway. Look for the second edition.

2.  Dick Darby the strong [???].  I enclose 
a copy - the tune is 'mush-mush" 
 I have only once heard this rollicking
 folk song sung and that by Geordie 
MacMillan, Tinkler Gypsy.  If you 
[turn up?] [p3?]01 of Tinkler Gypsies
 you will find a reference to it there.

3  "The echo mocks the corncrake among
 the [Broomie?] [Knowly?] alas the gentle
man I heard this one sung by - and 
here comes in some intense work for
 you.  Mr. Robt G Jardine, presently in 
Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia.  The name 
of his new house there is Ben[yellary] Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia [
South Africa?]  I think 
he will be into his new house ere your Letter would reach him.  Say I told you 
to ask him for a copy of that song 
which one of the farm hands at [Arbeack??] 
near [Whisthome, Wigtoronshire???] sang 
& which R.G. J has often repeated to me 

4.  Better ask for the [tune] as well.
