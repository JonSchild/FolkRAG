to London on Monday 29th and if 
you were free between, say, 4.30 and
6.00, I should be most pleased to
come out to Highgate.
However, I realize that it is
highly unlikely that this time will
be convenient, so maybe we could
find a time in June, if you are
still in this country.
Yours sincerely,
Colin Tilney
