The place to look for him is in a crowd - among the millions we call The People         Acme

THE COMMONES TMAN IN THE WORLD
This is one of the most unusual articles we have
ever printed. It breaks many of the conventional
editorial rules. But we believe it will stir and
thrill you... and keep you guessing to the end

HE'S the commonest man I know. He's
so common he never talks about "the 
common man." He talks about "bozos"
and "geezers" and "eggs" and "galoots."
   Let me tell you about this galoot.
   He's a Swede, the way most of the people
who made this country in case you've forgotten 
it, are Swedes or Poles or Irish or
Italians. He was born in a prairie town in
Illinois sixty-three years ago. His father came
over in the steerage and worked on the railroads
and couldn't write his name.
   So, you see, he came from the people who
made this country and who, to look at the 
front page or the society column, aren't there
at all and never have anything happen to
them. There are millions of them, and they're 
called The People.
   His father's name was August Johnson,
but there were so many Swedes named Johnson
working in the railroad shop that one
day the paymaster said to August Johnson, 
"There are too many Johnsons to keep track
of." So August Johnson changed his name and

his children's name. Let's call the son Johnson,
anyway.
   When he was thirteen young Johnson was
working on a milk wagon, dipping out a pint 
of milk for a pink ticket and a quart for a
green one. Then he got a job as a porter in a
barbershop, and once he shined the shoes of
three Congressmen who came to town for 
another Congressman's funeral.
   Then he hit the road. He got a job as a 
scene shifter in one town and a truckman in
another, as an apprentice to a potter somewhere,
as a helper to a house painter somewhere
else. He washed dishes in Omaha and
Denver. He harvested wheat in the fields of 
Kansas.
   Everywhere he went he found common men
and lived with them. But though he called 
potatoes "spuds" and coffee "java" and
money "mazuma," there was something uncommonly
common about him. He wanted to 
find out something. he wanted to find out 
why he was here and here he was go-
and what was worth living for and why. C-

mon men all want to find this out, but Johnson
made it his business.
   He arrived in Denver in a boxcar and almost
got nabbed in the yards. He rode the
"bling baggage" over Hagerman Pass and
almost got choked by the smoke in the tunnel.
He slept anywhere and everywhere. Once he 
slept in a new house that didn't have the roof 
on yet. He thinks that that was the funniest 
place he ever slept.
   Working everywhere at everything he grew
strong. (His father had been a blacksmith in
the old country.) His hands grew brown and 
knobby, and his shoulders big and mobile. 
Time and trouble, wind and weather, blind
baggage and boxcar drew long lines down his
Swede face. To a soft and civilized world he
came to look like something out of rock, or
maybe a relief map. Hardly anybody remembers
him when his hair wasn't white.
   It wasn't his own troubles that lined his
face and turned his hair. It was all the troubles
of all the other people in the world. Johnson
ate regularly, laughed regularly, sang regu-

and at night he sat at Pabst's and drank beer
and listened to the free concerts. But he
didn't find out what he went to Milwaukee
to find out.
   So he went to Chicago and got a job o-
newspaper. Reporters found out things. -
Johnson wasn't a good reporter; he -
things his own way. So he didn't find out wh-
he went to Chicago to find out. And there he
was, getting on, and he had no profession, no
business, no "racket." There was only one
thing he knew about: the common people, 
and their songs and stories and the myths they 
lived by, their dreams, their troubles, and the 
hopes they fed on. There was only one thing 
he could do: he could tell their tall tales and
legends and sing their ballads and their ditties.
   He carried a notebook around with him,
and his pockets were stuffed full of papers, 
notes of old songs and old stories, and this 
and that and anything and everything that 
belonged to the people. It all belonged to 
Johnson. His pockets were the people's songbag,
and his noodle was their question box.

Another Common Bozo

ANDt then he heard about a bozo that was
supposed to be the commonest man that had
ever lived in this country. This bozo was dead, 
but people were still talking about him, singing 
about him, lying about him. He had become
a kind of saint to a lot of common people.
Johnson though he'd look him up and
see what he had to say.
   This bozo was a lot like Johnson. they
both came out of prairie poverty. The father
of one of them couldn't write his name, the
mother of the other couldn't write hers. They 
both had to quit school to work with their 
hands, and they both read books, good books, 
when they could. They both told jokes and 
stories, and laughed and shocked respectable 
people. They both had a rhythm to their 
words that made people listen. They both had
knobby hands and faces lined like fissured
rock, and they both love what was common
for no better reason than that it was common.
they both volunteered in wars, and both of
them wondered, before and after, what war
was about. Neither of them was sure he knew 
anything for sure, and both of them had a 
fanatic faith that the people were worth the 
trouble God took to make them.
   The more Johnson found out about this 
bozo, the more he wanted to find out. "The
