      Office worker whose home is in Virginia Beach:  ("They say that during maneuvers the night of the wind storm they made the boys practice using life boats and 60 of them were left in the ocean.")

      Question:     "Do you suppose there's any truth in that?"

       Office worker:   "Well, they finally got the number reduced to four."
