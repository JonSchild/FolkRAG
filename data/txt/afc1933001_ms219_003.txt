Dear Father,

A small note of inquiry only-- a cousin of Ben Robinson's
called me yesterday to ask whether you had received the book
of old songs by Elija Owens which Ben has  already sent you.
Ben has not received notification that this book has come,
and would like to know about it. if you have not received
it write him and let me know, too, so that I can run it down
here either at Hyatsville or at the Library address

Not much news from me except that I am very busy. I
will be in New York Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for the
International Congress of Musicologists.

These appearances are on the cuff; the library pays my
way.

Write me. With much love to you both
