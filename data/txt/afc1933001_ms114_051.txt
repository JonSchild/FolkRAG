Chirstmas was a lot of fun; I had a little cold so it was a 
very quiet one. We mostly lay around and caught up on the gossip and
drank tomato juice. My Christmas was certainly a luxurious one -- I
haven't xx got my typewriter yet, but I will soon. And, you will be 
glad to know, I finally got my suit made. This is its birthday night
and I'm wearing it proudly. It certainly turned out pretty; I got a
very good man's tailor to fix it up for me, cost me thirty dollars
including the lining, buttons, inner lining and everything. I feel
so elegant.
Alan and Elizabeth seemed well, pretty uncertain as to what
exactly they were going to do, but very happy. They have a lovely
place to live, though its horribly expensive. The book of Gilbert
and Sullivan came -- thank you so much.
Please remember that I do love you very much, even though you
don't hear from me very often. Things happen so fast, and so frequently,
I think back about Texas and wish so much to see you.

I hope you heard the School of the Air the other day that Pete and I were on. I was
pinch-hitting for another girl who woke up Tuesday morning with a sore throat, so
I had no time to let you know. I love you.
