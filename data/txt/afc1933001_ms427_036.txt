THE STANDARD OF REVOLT.
(The Red Flag)

The cruel tyrants of the nation
Have always shed the workers' blood;
The people's wrath and indignaton
Arises in a mighty flood. (repeat)

Refrain: Far and wide
Spreads the tide
Of our wrath.
We hoist the flag of revolution,
It proclaims;
W orkers' aims,
Rebels' path,
Tyrants' defeat, retribution.
We raise our standard,
Freedom's banner,
Its coulour is the deepest red,
For it the workers' blood was shed.

The en'my's brutal rage and fury
Our day of reckoning won't stay;
The people will be judge and jury
To try the tyrants of to-day. (repeat)

Refrain:

March onward, brothers, into battle,
The dawn of liberty is near;
No more shall we, like voiceless cattle,
Be driven by the goad of fear. (repeat)

Refrain:

Let now the tyrants fret and shudder,
The hour approaches of their fall;
The working class will turn the rudder,
Give life and freedom to us all. (repeat)
