(1) Dear Mother it is so cold here
and we have to sleep out
door's.  We sleep in sleeping
bags with blankets and an
additional sleeping bag.

(2) [There is two things which 
make writing to you hard,
one it is so hot that I 
don't feel like it and two
the mosquito are so thick
that it is practically 
impossible.]
This letter is written by 
candle light so mistakes are,
I hope, permissable.  Of late we
haven't enough power to run
lights throughout the camp.

The mosquitos and other
insects are too thick here
and concentrating on letter
writing is about impossible.
