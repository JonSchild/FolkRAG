Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was greatly pleased to hear that you will participate
in the broadcast of December 27, and also to

doubt as to the best way of organizing that broadcast,
which, as you know, I planned to devote primarily to
recent books of poetry. I see two general possibilities;

beginning of the broadcast and you near the end; second, 
that you would join in a conversation for 12 minutes - 
say from 2:08 to 2:20.

I am inclined to prefer the first of these plans. If, 
however, you and Mr. Van Doren think the second is
preferrable, please feel free to adopt it. In that case
you will perhaps wish to arrange between yourselves the
substance and direction of your conversation, merely
letting me know about it in general.

If the first plan is acceptable to you I shall begin
by talking about Mr. Van Doren's new book and shall
introduce him at 2:05. He will then speak about the
book for approximately six minutes. Following his talk
I shall review briefly other new books of poetry and
then will describe OUR SINGING COUNTRY and express my
own admiration for the book and pleasure in it. At 
2:20 I will introduce you. It seems to me that your
