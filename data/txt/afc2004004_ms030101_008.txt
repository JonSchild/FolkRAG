Two Major Folk Singers With Blas to Burn
By Alfred Frankenstein

IN HIS NOTES to Shirley Elizabeth Collins' first Folkways disc, False True Lovers, Alan Lomax contributes a nice new word to the vocabulary of musical criticism.

 "In Gaelic-speaking Ireland," says Lomax, "when a singer has full command of certain techniques of ornamenting tunes, they say he has blas. The equivalent expression in English would be singing style, but that does not quite express the whole of the idea contained in the Irish word . . . Blas does not stand for just musicianship, but for the manner in which the singer varies the tune in slight but metrically and emotionally significant ways from stanza to stanza, and without obtruding his personality too blatantly; if refers to subtle tempo changes which accomodate lines of varying length; it has to so with the way in which certain phrases are emphasized or given color by changes in vocal timbre;and all of these things are ways of linking the verse to the tune and require talent, practice, and taste on the part of the singer."

Blas is not a virtue limited to folk singers.  The term would seem to apply to the somewhat mysterious qualities of personality and projection which distinguish the real artist from the routine performer in every field, from clacking the bones to conducting symphony orchestras. But in the field of folk music, blas is most likely to be possessed by performers with a folk background; the academically trained artist seldom acquires it in this area. 

Miss Collins, of whom more later, has blas to burn. So has Harry Jackson, whom
Folkways has recorded in one of the most remarkable album sets of the year. 

THIS album is called The Cowboy, His Songs, Ballads,  and Brag Talk. It is a two-record set (Folkways FH 5723) containing 27 songs and four bits of "brag talk." It is the most extensive and elaborate survey of cowboy music ever issued at one time on records, and compares most favorably with the great recorded documents in this

the notes, is a real character. By profession he is a painter and sculptor, but he spent nearly all his adolescence and young manhood as a ranch hand in Wyoming, where he learned the cowboy repertoire in cowboy style. No American folk style has been so generally prettied up and falsified as this one, and to hear these songs performed in the authentic way will be a revelation to many.

 Jackson sings everything without accompaniment in the objective, impersonal, yet marvelously expressive manner which is the sign of the true folk musician throughout the Western world. He does many of the classics — "Little Joe the Wrangler," Strawberry Roan," Tying a Knot in the Devil's Tail," "The Zebra Dun," "The Streets of Laredo," "I Ride an Old Paint," and so on—and many cowboy songs of equal value but slighter fame; also included are a few ballads.
