Mister Furr and Mister Chatman totes too big-a guns,
They kill any man that 'tempts to run.
Don't make Mister white mad,
He's got a high powered rifle and it's too black bad.
You just as well's to hit your ma as to hit your pa,
As to try to make whiskey under the new Jones law.
If they catch you, they'll put you in Coahoma County jail,
Then [you wonâ€™t] you'll want bad Mister Doggett to go your bail.
But since he's dead,
They'll give you six long months in the Coahoma County jail.
