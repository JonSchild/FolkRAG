"A boy I know who was in the attack at Pearl Harbor came home
after to get well and said this was supposed to be a military
secret. They buried the boys who died at Pearl harbor in big
pits dug by power shovels -- as many as 500 bodies were put in
the hole, carried by other soldiers who wrapped each body in a 
blanket and put it in the pit."
Said a mill girl who heard this from the boy's family.
