BJ TAPE 7A, p. 55

we lived in they didn't do it 'cause there was like, like my
Papa an' uncles an' diffrunt ones around there an' the other
friends that they know -- That I know of, ah, I'm sure they
wouldn't even know how it be done. Because, you know, when
somebody go to far wit' these things, they call 'em off an'
talk to 'em. "That's not the way to treat a child." Or
so-and-so, how, [they] how do it, you, you know? But you can't do it
now. Ya can't even tell 'em about it like that. you see?
No! Not now, um-hum. Ah-ah...
TL: Why not now?
BJ: 'Cause lots of people jes', they too high-minded an' they
too unthoughtful to not to think -- 'Nother thing, they think
you tryin' to rule they house an' they business. Jes' isn'--
Tha's right. Jes' like you, you git to tell me [about my doin'] if I done
sumpin' wrong someplace, like ah, walkin' along or goin' someplace
I shouldn't go to; anybody ask me where I'm goin'. "Does
your mama know where ya at?" or whatnot. See? You ask chilren
that now, they, they, the chile hisse'f'll insult ya. Ya see?
It's a diffrunt...Hit's altogether diffrunt. Everything come
along jus' humble an' good. Hit's better days. Them folks said
"the good old days;" they was better. With the, with ah,
spiritual mind of peoples, they wa' much better. Much better.
The chilren went out at night; you knew where chilren were when
night come. But now ya don't know where -- Some of the peoples
don't know where their chilren is when night come. Got to go to
call 'em. An' see where they at. Sometimes wway in the night
lookin' for 'em. Tha's bad stuff, I'm tellin' you! It jus' ain't 
that way; it wa'n' that way then. An' that...an' ah, they was 
raised up more diffrunt.
