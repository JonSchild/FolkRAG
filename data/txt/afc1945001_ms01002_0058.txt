Worksheet on Morale. 
This memorandum represents one of a series of 
explorations undertaken by a seminar in Psychological 
Problems of Morale in the Department of Psychology at 
Harvard University under the direction of Dr. G. W. 
Allport and Dr. H. A. Murray 
Tentative and incomplete in character, it is released 
at this time for the use of morale-building agencies, both 
private and governmental, and for the use of other groups 
interested in pursuing studies in the field of national morale. 

The A B C's of Wartime Rumor 
I. What is rumor? 
Rumor is a specific but unverified proposition for 
belief, disseminated through a series of persons. It 
has three important characteristics: 
a. It is a way of communicating information, namely, 
by informal interpersonal relations. While 
rumor, once current, may be disseminated by newspapers 
and radio, it is to be distinguished from 
verified information transmitted by these means. 
b. It purports to state an objective fact concerning 
some person, happening or condition. As such 
it reflects an interest in and a desire for knowledge 
about certain subjects. 
c. Rumor expresses the wishes, fears, and hostilities 
of the group through which it is transmitted. 
It is therefore an index of the emotional state of 
the people among whom it is current. This we shall 
call its expressive aspect. 

II. How is rumor related to morale? 
Rumor bears upon problems of morale in four primary 
ways. The first three parallel the basic characteristics 
of rumor outlined above.
