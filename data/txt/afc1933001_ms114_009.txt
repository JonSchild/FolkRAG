Saturday

Dearest Patsy:
   I am so sorry that it seemed so long to all of you
before I got a letter to you.  I had a lot of things to do of
course but I was so worried about daddy and trying to decide
what was best for all of us to do that I could not make myself
do anything.  So I just walked and walked and thought and
thought.  Daddy still thinks that it would be best for us to
go to Lubbock and settle down since it will probably be very
long before he will be where we could see him.  After I have
seen how terribly crowded and dirty this town is and no nice
places to go or places to eat and not anything like a place to
live and when people who have been to the other sea ports tell
me that it is much worse other places I guess we had better give
up the idea of trying to be anywhere that he might be.
   I do not know how much longer I will be here, but
not too long.  I have not seen the ship yet, since everything is
very dirty and messy on board but I will before I come home.
It has rained all day yesterday and today and just now stopped
