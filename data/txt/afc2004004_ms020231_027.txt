wasn't comin' to look at them, but I was comin' out that side.
An' that car come up there.  An' the funny wheels on the car,
'long in them days.  High, funny seat.  They, they put the lil'
clo'es or sumpin' in there, in there.  Then they put the baby on
the [tin] thing.  An' so, an', an' he wouldn't lay down.  An' so
she said, the colored woman told 'em, said, "Let him sit up."
Said, "He'll sit up."
         An' so, then he want her to go with him, you know, the time,
to, to hold 'im.  She say, "He'll set up."  An' she set him up.
         Now, that's only thing that I could see of 'im, just a lil'
side of 'is face.  I never [could] did see the ho'ns, ya know, or 
anything[, ya] on it, 'cause they had him (on a coat?).
AL:    Oh, it really had horns?
BJ:     It had two ho'ns.  It had two lil' ho'ns an' a, a lil' tail.
An' two -- an' three fingers, you know, jus' -- it like a devil's
toes an' things.  They jes' prawn out, like that.  Yessir.  You
know she had him.  Said the devil from hell in her house.  So that

         An' so. . .An' this doctor -- hit was in the papers about it --
this doctor say -- Hit, hit was a doctor that come an' got 'im
from town.  -- The doctor say that hit -- ah, Dawson was five miles --

go that fast, hardly, in them days.  But he [said] say he guarantee he
went there in 5 minutes.  Ha, ha, ha!  The de-- He, he said that
thing, that baby -- he called it "thing" -- said that baby jus'
looked [out] down, an' looked up; looked down an' looked up.  He
had it wropped up, ya know, in that, in that, in 'is clo'es an'
pillows around it.  An' say he looked down an' looked up.  Boy,
that man was scared to death!  Never seen such a thing in his
[life]
