A First aid Lesson.
     Miss Brown had been attending first
aid classes. One day two cars collided in
front of her home. A man had a broken
leg, a lady a broken wrist and arm,
another suffered with a brain concussion.
     The next time she attended her class
she told them, "I am glad I took first
aid, for when I saw them lying there,
I put my head down and I didn't
faint."
