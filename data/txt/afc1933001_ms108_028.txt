 unchaperoned! Anyway we shall 
certainly hold the thought.
I have discovered that the 
nets on our bed are not 
merely for show, or so I believe 
I'll leave you and crawl under 
before the mosquitoes do 
me further damage.

New dishes:  (1) Cabbage leaves 
stuffed with ground nuts and sort of 
stewed, (2) chicken-livers 
halved, strung on skewers or 
long nails, [with] liver alternated 
with pieces of bacon - the whole 
broiled. (3) omelet served with 
lemon, sometimes with a 
sugar sauce, sometimes 
with syrup, or a little rum 
set on fire just as it is 
served. (4) cauliflower fritters
covered with a batter & fried 
(5) artichokes with a hot vinegar-butter
sauce. For patisseries or sweets 
consult Bess and Elizabeth.
We had a nice letter from Johnny
but nary a word from Alan.
Mrs. Seeger said he was to take a 
recording trip latter part of March. Hope 
you get your Dallas trip. Glad times are 
better -Love to all of you
