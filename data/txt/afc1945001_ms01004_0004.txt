FOLLOW-UP LETTER TO INTERVIEWERS

August 7, 1942

Mr. Thomas E. Hutchinson
1527 North Colorado Avenue
Indianapolis, Indiana

Dear Mr. Hutchinson:

How did you like your position as listening-post for the Research
Center last week? We're anxious to learn how you made
out, but in the meantime would like to take the liberty of
asking you to continue the experiment for one week more.

There's a possibility that this preliminary work on the subject
of rumors may lead to more extensive studies in the
future, and we'd like to give the experiment seven more days.

If possible, therefore, we'd appreciate it if you would remain
"rumor-conscious" until Saturday evening, August 15, and mail
us at that time whatever additional rumors you collect between
now and then. You probably still have some cards left over,
but if not, feel free to purchase more and to bill us for the
amount.

Thanks greatly for your fine cooperation on this.

Cordially yours

Paul B. Sheatsley
Eastern Representative
