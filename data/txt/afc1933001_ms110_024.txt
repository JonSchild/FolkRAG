other things. That was all bought at Craig-Gholson's at their
spring sale. At Hemphill Wells I got two slips, a blue flannel
dress for school for three dollars! and a pair of shoes. None
of these, except the pajamas, didn't I really need, if you follow
me, and they were all bought on xxxx sale! I hope this isn't
pushing you too hard. I won't do much more of it, I promise. 
I'm enclosing the bill back from Hemphills. It is for the
clothes itemized above, so I guess you do owe it.

I'm just having a wonderful time, my weight's going
down (slight rise while my visitors were here-- I've never eaten
so much in my life--) and I'm getting quite brown for me from 
going swimming so much. I've had the tag ends of my old xxxxxxxx
permanent cut off so it's short and straight now and I'll keep 
it this way until just xx before I leave Lubbock; I've had such
good luck with permanents xx from Shilrey's hairdresser and she
charges less than a third of what they do up North and other
places in the state. Please write me soon; I must run now and 
study my German. My exam's tomorrow. Wish me luck.

Your loving daughter, 

Bess

I'll write as soon as the correspondence and the "conferences"
start and tell you how they come, and whether I think I can do
xxxxxxxx as well away from conferences. z You see that with only
the second semester offered at SMU that I couldn't start
in on that. Dearest love from Shirley, she says, and from the
children to you both.
