Oh, Mr. Blank, the Civil Service Authorities are looking for you.
Say, Bob, why don't you join the [Marine] Navy. I hear that's it's
lots of fun. Why join the [Marine] Navy when the highest a
colored boy can [go is] be promoted is second messboy.
As a ship was sinking with [some] one boy on
board, I heard him say to himself, Is this what I am
fighting for?
After some colored soldiers had had a 'riot'
down in Georgia, I was standing around as they
loaded them into the truck and took them to [?]
their commanding officer. One of the colored
soldiers who were standing around remarked 
and said, "So this is what we are fighting for.
A[n] man can't even speak his own opinion those
days without an officer walking over and
knocking a man down which causes a riot.
A young boy walked in the [stone] store &
asked to buy some [grapefruit juice] tomato soup where
upon he was [state] told that it [?] was frozen.
He replied innocently "That's allright
madam, I'll warm it."
