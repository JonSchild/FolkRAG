"RUMORS RELATED TO THE WAR EFFORT"

II.  Observation on Rumors Heard:
My entire time has been spent outside of the office endeavoring to
pick up current rumors, and I not only had to make an unusually large
number of contacts to obtain the rumors listed above, but I also had to
encourage and direct conversation along that line.  You will observe that
two of the examples were heard in some form twice, and all the others
were heard only once each.  Neither the frequency heard nor the individual
reaction of others to any one of the examples impressed me as particularly
significant.  While it is entirely possible that there are rumors
prevalent in the State, which one person would not pick up or come in
contact with in the short period of a five-day survey, still I am confident
that there are no rumors reaching serious proportions in Oklahoma
at this time.
