Lomax: What is a bothy ballad?
Hamish: A bothy-ballad - it's the name given to songs that the
farm hands, the farm lads and lassies made up when they were
together at nights in the bothies. A kind of farm-buildings, sheds,
where they would sleep at night. And as they were all there
together, one would start a ballad and another would take it up
until finally they had a complete ballad going, as they were lying
there together in the shed. . .
Here is a little collection of reel tunes - amongst the livliest
of highland dances. It's mouth music. When the people haven't a 
pipe or a fiddle, welll, then somebody of the company would sing.
and this was the sort of affect it made.
Cho:
Tail toddle, tail toddle,
Tammy gars my tail toddle.
But and ben wi' diddle doddle
Tammy gars my tail toddle.
Our goodwife went ower to Fife
For to buy a coal riddle,
Lang ore she cam' back again
O Tammy gar'd my tail toddle. (CHo.)
When I'm dead I'm oot o' date,
When I'm sick I'm full o' trouble,
When I'm weel I stap aboot
And Tammy gars my tail toddle.
Jessie Jack she gied a plack,
Helen Wallace goed a boddle,
Quo' the bride, "It's ower little
For to mend a broken doddle. . ."
 
2) O warp and row, warp and row,
Warp and row the feetie o't,
I thought I was a maiden pure until I heard the greetie o't.
My daddy was a fiddler fine,
My minnie she made mantie o,
And I myself a thumping quine
Wha danced the reel o' stumpie-o.
Lomax: Would they be able to dance to that?
Hamish: Yes, very nearly. But as there's nobody dancing here, I
don't have the impetus. . .
Lomax: Would that song be sung in a group of people? It's slightly
improper, so would anybody be singing it?
Hamish: In the old Scottish society anyonewuld sing it. There wasn't
much prudishness amongst the old Scots people.
Lomax: How far back?
