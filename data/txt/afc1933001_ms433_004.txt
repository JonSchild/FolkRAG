Johnny Darm and Johnny Bull
The Dutchman and the Wop
In Union Square they meet our Sammy Boy
Said Johnny Darm to Dutchy
What was the war about
Said Dutch, I ain't no crossword puzzle toy.

Chorus

We ain't goin to war no more, no more
We ain't goin' to war no more
Why in the heck should I carve your neck
Boy! We ain't goin' to war no more.

Said Bull to Dutch they tell me
You eat children in your soup
Oh, no, said Dutch we keep good pip for that
Said Sam you want the sun to shine
In your backyard alone
And only miners can live in the dark

So Dutchy boy he up and says
All them queer tales you tell
Is news to me and sure makes my head ring
Because the big guns in my land
Hav told us right along
T'was you the fellows did thisvery thing.

So Woppy spoke I think my boys
Its a conspiracy
To keep us knocking heads so we can't see
The little game of swapping lands and people all around
Which they call by the name of diplomacy.

So Johnny Darm and Dutchie
And Sam, John Bull and Wop
Swore no more guns to tote in far countree
But leave it to the generals and the admirals to rot
In trenches far from home and familiee.
