Actors Entertain Soldiers

Many of our friends and relatives
are in different branches of the armed
forces. These men like some kind of
entertainment so many of the actors and
actresses render their services to
the armed forces for entertainment, and
the selling of war bonds and stamps.

One night I went to the
theater. There was a stage show to.
One comedian asked the another "Why aren't
you in the army?" The other replied, didnt
you hear the president say on the radio
"that we were going to fight until the last
man?" The other man replied "yes I heard it
What about it?" Well replied the first
man. I'm the last man
