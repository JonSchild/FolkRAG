London. Feb. 26, Monday
This diary begins in the 
Caf√© Columbo, Great Portman
Street, London, round the 
corner from the BBC. I have 
just ordered a small moule
and Spaghetti Bolognaise. In 
my pocket I have approximately 
50 pounds, small silver in side 
coat pocket because there are 
holes in both pants pockets.
From that it is clear that
I badly need a wife. The
young lady at my right hand 
with brown hair and blue
green eyes makes me very
happy because of her deep
childish connexion with all
beautiful tender things, but
probably will not marry me.
