Chain Gang Negroes - Page Nine

no group forced to trot to the fields or to trot back at night.
One rainy afternoon in Louisiana, I saw a large group of Negroes
come slogging through the mud from the cane fields. They looked
spent and utterly exhausted. Probably the dreary rain,
semi-darkness, the sordid gloom of the prison camp added to their
despair and dejection. I felt the depression. That group gave
me no songs.

Out in a Texas prison camp the Negroes sing a slow work
song the words of which fit the mood of those weary Mississippi
boys. Calling the sun "Old Hannah, dat hot broiling sun turning
over" the song runs:

"I looked at Old Hannah an' she's turnin' red,
I looked at my pardner an' he's almost dead.
Go down Old Hannah, don't you rise no mo',
If you rise any mo' bring Jedgment Day!"

Unfortunately, penitentiaries, like institutions for the
insane, reform schools, and other homes for social dependents,
with officers appointed through political influence, have too
few interested visitors. What goes on inside of such places is
sometimes a grave reflection on organized society. Moreover,
prison managements cannot know always what happens when inhuman
guards are away with a gang of men. Guards are generally underpaid
and sometimes are unable to live with their families. The 
work is brutalizing. Now and then terrible conditions come to 
light. Happily I escaped being a witness.

In Louisiana and in Mississippi, all the guarding is done
by long term convicts. No official in the Mississippi system
