He read the name, and the name read like this--
"Death and Hell followeth him."
I heard the dying thief say,
"Lord, O Lord! Lord, O Lord!
When thou come to thy father's kingdom,
I pray remember me.
Oh, motherless child,
Hangin' on the cross,
An' I want you to remember me."

7 Jesus, my dear friends--
The dying thief had so much confidence in Him--
Jesus, hung just like he was,
Jesus, daggered in the side,
Blood dripping, great God!--
Jesus caught ahold of the bridle, my dear friends,
Caught it by the bridle,
And the old horse began to paw,
Oh-h-h, Elijah didn't catch ahold of him, when he was comin',
Oh-h-h, Job didn't catch ahold of him when he was comin',
Oh-h-h, Great Godamighty!
Moses, the great lawgiver, didn't catch ahold of him,
But over younder, the incarnate Son of God
Caught the horse by the bridle and held him still.

8 Jesus begin to speak,
Yes! says to the dyin' thief,
"Pay no attention to death."
Says to the dyin' thief,
"This day your spirit will be with me in heaven."
Says, "Oh, yes, this day it will be with me. . . ."

9 God met the Devil when he seen him comin',
We began to wonder where he was goin'
You needn't wonder, but just keep still,
He'll let you know what He's comin' for.

And then He fastened the great dragon,
Great God! bound him for so many thousand years,
Seen Him, my dear friends, when He got ahold of Death,
Twist the stinger away from Death--
Death haven't got no dominion over a child of God!

10  I seen Jesus whisper hell to his father,
Told him to send down angels of grace--
"Let them roll back the stone,
Then stay there and let my mother know I am gone as I said."
Great Godamighty!
We seen when Godamighty with His omnipotent power,
Good God!
Called Michael and Gabriel,
Both peaceful angels,
"Both angels that obey me."
Praise God! Seen when Jesus told the boys,
"Don't, don't harm those peoples that is settin' at the grave,
Don't say nothin' to 'em,
I'll give power,
I'll cause the earth to quake ahead of yuh!"
