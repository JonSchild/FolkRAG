Sophomore     White   Female
1.  A sergeant was writing down the names of the
boys in a certain camp. He asked one boy his
name and the boy said George O. Brown. The
sergeant said George O. who and the boy said
well practically everyone sir.
2. I heard that a boy overseas hadn't heard from
his wife for a long time and he wrote and
told her to go to censored.  The next day he
got 50 letters from her and he spent his
whole pay check in sending her a telegram
that he didn't mean what he wrote her and
that he loved her.
