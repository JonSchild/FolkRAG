4. Don't all "White folks" music 
except the old longmeter tunes.
5. Probably too much clapping 
is employed and it begins 
too early in the program to 
be most dramatically effective.
6. Somewhere in your 
program you should include
some of the beautiful
work songs sung in the 
fields; also some of the "hollers."

It is  easy, I know,
to criticize. You will 
know best if any of my suggestions 
are feasible.
Sincerely yours,
