poet laureate . . . .

   "All Texas is to be congratulated upon the selection
of Lexie Dean Robertson of Rising Star to be the next
Poet Laureat.  The joint committee of the House and
Senate could have made no happier, no more popular
choice.  Fourth in the succession of laureates, Mrs. Robertson
will be the first native of the state to be so designated,
a fact that will lend added distinction to the post
during her incumbency.  The new laureate was born in
East Texas, but has long been a resident of West Texas,
which claims her as its own, and is proud of her achievements.
She will bring to the all-Texas post not only a
record of worthy accomplishment as a writer, but a personality
in which the sunlight and sincerity of her own
west are happily blended, and the well-wishing of a legion
of friends throughout the broad Southwest." -- Editorial,
The Dallas Morning News.
