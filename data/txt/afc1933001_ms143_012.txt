Dear Dr. Lomax: 
I am in receipt of your letter of March 16 and thank you for 
your suggestions regarding the kinds and types of recordings 
of Amish tunes still necessary to complete our study of Amish 
hymns and hymn tunes. 

We have been able to secure the consent of a small group of 
Iowa Amish to help us with the recordings provided we can give 
them an absolute guarantee that the recordings will not be 
commercialized. I think our knowledge of Pennsylvania Dutch 
and certain connect ons which I have in Iowa may help me to 
persuade them that we have no sinister motives in wishing to 
record the hymns. The work must be done during the first week 
in April, probably about the fourth or fifth. Hence I am 
writing to the Archives asking for a loan of one of the recording 
machines. We do not know to whom to address such a request; 
hence, I am enclosing my formal request, in the hope that you 
will direct it to the proper person or persons. 

Perhaps I should admit, too, that I am not exactly a skilled 
recording machine operator, although I have done some work 
along that line. If you do not care to trust me to do the 
recording with the machine, perhaps you could designate someone 
in the Department of Speech at the University of Iowa to whom
you would feel like entrusting your machine and helping us with 
the recording. The University of Iowa will not be more than 
fifty or seventy-five miles from the community where our recordings 
are to be made. 

Sincerely yours, 
John Umble
