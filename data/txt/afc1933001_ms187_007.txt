I should like to work out a program in
the South along lines which I have seen
and dreamed for a long time. Now that
Negro men from "everywhere" are being
brought together in camps there is an
added chance to do marvelous things for
the causes of our interest, morale and
the nation, now and forever. The Negro,
in his music and contagious spirit
of durable faith is bound to be doing
wonderful things at present!
I would be pleased to hear from
you in detail. When that happens I 
shall be in a position to make out a
program for your inspection. I would like
to work on a broad basis - there is
much to be done.
With best wishes
Willis Laurence James
N.B. since I returned, I have been trying to locate McTell. I think I have him.
