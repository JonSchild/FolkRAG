"the Battle of Lake Erie"
EMELIA C. BARK, Erie, Pa. :
The only well-known poem extolling 
a hero of the battle of 
Lake Erie, other than Perry, 
wanted by E. W. Jan. 14, is "The 
Balled of James Byrd," author 
unknown, a copy of which I enclose,
cut from an Erie newspaper
of 1895.  There are twenty-one 
four-line stanzas beginning:

Sons of freedom, listen to me,
And ye daughters, too, give ear;
You a sad and mournful story 
As was ever told shall hear.

The only place to find the poem
 in print, I believe, is in the appendix
 (page 289) in Charles Dutton's
 "Oliver Hazard Perry, "
published by Longmans, Green &
Co., 1935.  Mr. Dutton was an Erie
man and probably got it from the
same source as I did.  The complete
story of the episode is also
told there by Mr. Dutton.

E. W. writes upon receipt of a
copy of this poem that " it seems
to be the one I was after."
