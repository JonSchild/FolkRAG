So they tell me when Daniel walked up there an begin to talk with the
king, king tell him, "Well I'll give you a few days in prayer."   Went an
talked with Him a little while.  Tell me th at after Daniel prayed he
went an tole Daniel his trouble with the dream:  Hi s weakn ess caused
him to be brought to sorrow.  An what I'm tryin to git you to see, friend,
the thing that the king had, the reason it got away from him, she akin
to the point that peo ple sometime don't know what they where they got

Mrs. D:  Yeah!
Rev. D:  (harsh shout)  Som e lost it -- in the bar room.
Mrs. D:  Yeah!

Mrs. D:  Oh yes!
Rev. D:  God want yo u to keep everything that He give you!  The way that
we conduct ourselves causes us to lose out in the si ght of Christ.  The
king had lost out cause he had mistrusted hissef doin the thing that God
had told him to do an had lost the thing th at God had given him.  Wadn't 
able to tell what it is.  Somebody is gone out of love of Christ.  In that
