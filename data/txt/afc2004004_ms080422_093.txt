Tape:  897 cont. Nimrod Workman  3
Nimrod:  Yeah, that's right.  And women that destroys infant
babies that got breath in them.  Anything that destroys, shooting
with a gun, or drowning, or whatever way you take their life,
he said, take not that which you can't give.  And he give
breath to the people, but you can't do it, Huh?  He raised
the dead, but you can't do it. . . . . .If now a man just followed
every commandment of the Lord and lived just exactly like he
said, All these things I've done, he said, but greater things
can you do. . . .
AL:  When you were fighting for the unions in the early
day, you thought you were really doing the lord's work as
well, weren't you?
Nimrod:  Well, I was, in a way.  Because I didn't kill nobody,
and I was fighting against them people that had all the money.
I was fighting them people that was stealing bread out of
childrens' mouths, I was fighting them people who was taking
it away from the widows and the orphans, people that'd want
to hold you down and walk on you, and that's no wrong.  That
ain't no wrong.  God said, he put it here, he said let every
man do his best by the sweat of his face. . . .a lot of people
preach that it says brow, but it says face. . .if he does
that honestly, there ain't no sin to that, huh?  He says
listen, if you go ask one of them rich buggers for
something for a woman out here, a poor person, see
what they tell you.  Let them work for it, let 'em do
something else for it.  They don't give nothing, you know that
