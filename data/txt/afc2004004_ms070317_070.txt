55 Olea St. - Paul Lum

Arkansas Song.  Jerry Go [In] That Car
We Are Those [?].  Foreman Monroe

Hold the forks for the for the knives are coming
The plates & spoons are on the way
Tell that man at the head of the table
To pass that church this way

Camp Song, made up about
a boarding house in the Western Country

There was Ed Slocum, a man without skill
He had to leave Denver, for a cabbage did steal.
The stealin' of cabbage wouldn't keep him alive
And he started dead broke for Heal's [?] drive

There's Elmer McGaren, the worst of 'em all
He's so damn lazy, scarcely can crawl.
He'd set in his sleigh, his whips be flying,
Crying "Go on you old fellers,  you'll die before Spring.
