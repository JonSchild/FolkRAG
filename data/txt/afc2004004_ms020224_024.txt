every word she tell me was truth.  I can tell the world that.  Don't know wheter
they believe it or not, it was natchul true!
     Well, I kept writing to Fort Valley.  So one day, I told the 
people, I said, "Ain' no such a thing as Fort Dallas, Georgia."  An' so
I said, "She meant Fort Valley."  So, it kep' on, oh, years
passed, an' nothin' happened.  An' one day over the radio, somebody
was talkin' about sumpthin' on the radio, an' they said, "This
happened in Fort Dallas, Georgia."  An' he explained.  He said, "Not
Fort Valley, Fort Dallas."
     Oow!  I jumped up from the floor.  I said, "That woman was
right.  Hu, hu, hu, ha!  An' then I wrote. . .
TL:  You never did go to. . .
BJ:  I didn't go to Fort Dallas; I wrote to Fort Dallas after
that.  An' then, so, an' then I found out where Aunt Nin was at, you know,
by some other peoples.  Here in 'Lizabeth City, New Jersey?  I wrote her.
TL:  You found out where Aunt Nin?
BJ:  Nin, um-hum.  Her name was Hattie.  An' ah, I wrote to her an'
she wrote me back.  An' she said she hadn't seem 'im in 6 years.
Says the last time she heard from 'im, he's somewhere in Georgia. . .
An, ya see?  An' that was sumpthin'.  Six years!  That, that lil'
ol' time, an' I didn't know he was livin'. . .'Cause that, that,
that's been a long time now, though.  It sho' have.  A long time.
An' I didn't git non -- An' I lost her address.  I know she said
she married a man from Nebraska.  An' ah, she said she had 6 chirrun.
TL:  Your aunt?
BJ:  Uh-huh.  She here in 'Lizabeth City, New Jersey.  If I jest
could find out that, I'd jus' go right over there,
but I said I would try to hunt up -- 'Cause Uncle John was there,
too.  An' Uncle John -- I heard he had a drug store there.  Elizabeth
