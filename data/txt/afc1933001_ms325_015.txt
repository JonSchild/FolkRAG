He credits the World War and 
the peace that followed it with 
the rise of literature during the 
second and third decades of this 
century. Artists could stand aside 
and see through the abject false- 
hoods, the rosy glow of optimism, 
that warmed the common man in 
the years immediately after the 
war, and as a result they per- 
formed their true functions as 
artists.

"Then he wrote 'Elmer Gan-

prohibition. Some people said he 
exaggerated Elmer. Nonsense, I 
know those fellows. Elmer was 
one of the best of them; he was a 
scholar and a gentleman com- 
oared to some I've known, a 
prince among his kind. Lewis 
had a little fun with him, too, but 
basically it was a true portrait.

"The Prodigal Parents.' Frightful 
stuff. Imbecilic." 
The main trouble with Ameri- 
can literature, says Mr. Mencken, 
is that other writers also went 
into politics, and lost their gift 
of disbelief. 
The shock of depression caused

Foreigners Who Fought for the South

FOREIGNERS IN THE CON- 
FEDERACY. By Ella Lonn. 
Illustrated. 566 pp. Chapel Hill: 
University of North Carolina 
Press. $5. 

FOUR portraits illustrate this 
large volume and attract 
attention at once to its his- 
torical material. The frontis- 
piece shows Camille Arnaud 
Jules Marie, Prince de Polignac, 
who was born near Paris, placed 
his sword at the service of the 
Confederate States of America 
at the age of 29, and rose step 
by step until he became a major 
general in the Confederate forces. 
The second picture is of Major 
Gen. Patrick Ronayne Cleburne, 
born in County Cork, Ire- 
land, a lawyer in Arkansas at 
the outbreak of the Civil War. 
The next is of the Prussian-born 
Colonel Heros von Borcke, chief 
of staff to General J. E. B. 
Stuart, and, says this author, 
possessed of "many of the quali- 
ties which made his superior of- 
ficer so romantic a soldier." And 
the fourth illustration is the 
portrait of Colonel August Fors- 
berg, distinguished Swedish engi- 

neer in the Confederate Army. 
They were all in a sense knights- 
errant, four among many such 
who fought for the Southern 
cause. But if they and their fel- 
lows were the most conspicuous 
and picturesque of the foreigners 
who served the Confederacy, they 
were by no means the only ones, 
nor probably the most im- 
portant. The rank and file of the 
Confederate forces contained 
many thousands of foreign sol- 
diers; "there is hardly a country 
or clime of the earth, even a re- 
mote and small portion of the
globe, but had its representa- 
tives." 
There was "solid companies 
of Germans enlisted from sev- 
eral States of the Confederacy, a 
French legion, a Polish legion, 
companies of Italians, Spaniards 
and Mexicans, a European bri- 
gade, entire regiments of Irish." 
In spite of the incompleteness of 
records, Dr. Lonn has been able 
to compile a list of foreign com- 
panies which fills six and a hald 
pages; and it takes eleven pages 
to list the foreign officers in the 
Confederate armies and more 

than a page to list the foreign- 
born aides on the staffs of Con- 
federate generals. Moreover, two 
foreigners held portfolios in Jef- 
erson Davis's Cabinet and a 
number were engaged in diplo- 
matic missions for the Confed- 
eracy. Foreigners had obvious 
advantages as blockade runners. 
Foreign women served the Con- 
federacy, 
Dr. Lonn, who is Professor of 
History in Goucher College, pre- 
sents a great mass of material 
with the introductory remark 
that these "facts may prove sur- 
prising" and the concluding hope 
that they will not be ill received. 
"The story of the heroism and 
endurance of 9,000,000 people 
who could sustain an unequal 
struggle against 20,000,000 for 
four long years," she says, holds 
"glory sufficient and more than 
sufficient" for both foreign and 
native-born Southerner. Aside 
from its arresting quality as 
historical research her book, with 
its vivid personal stories and 
excerpts from contemporary rec- 
ords, is also full of a lively in- 
terest. 


and to Roosevelt. 
They believed that Roosevelt 
was going to make America 
more wonderful than it ever had 
ben before. They believed that 
the Russians had found a system 
of government that would permit 
every one to be comfortable and
happy. 
"Believing and trusting, they 
were out of the hurricane, free 
of the loneliness -- but they 
weren't artists. They couldn't 
perform the artist's function. 
They were enslaved by the 
Pinks." 
Best of the up-from-slavery 
writers, Mr. Mencken believes, is 
James T. Farrell. "Wonderful 
stuff in those Chicago tales. Who- 
ever doesn't like Farrell is an 
idiot or liar." Farrell had con- 
siderable critical backing three 
or four years ago, has been less 
prominently mentioned since. 
Mr. Mencken puts that down to
politics. "Farrell refused to go 
along with Stalin's boys, and as 
a critic he took a fall out of new 
authors they were bringing up. 
So the ganged him." Farrell's 
latest effort, a tale of the Chris- 
tian Front, does not appeal to 
Mr. Mencken, who found it
"idiotic, imbecilic, rot." "But, 
after all, every writer may crack 
up occasionally." 
He also likes William Saroyan: 
"the only one of the 'advanced' 
writers with pungency, with 
something fresh to say and a new 
way of saying it." 
John Steinbeck "has a great 
talent, but he must have been 
flattered by the pigs. The po- 
litical essays in 'Grapes of 
Wrath' are terrible. They might 
have been written by one of the 
kept idealists of the liberal mag- 
azines that run on a deficit. But 
the story is wonderful. I assume 
that he'll outgrow the stupid 
politics."
