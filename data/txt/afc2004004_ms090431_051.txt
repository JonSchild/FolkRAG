Fisk, 12. 12.

Don't no man gamble fair. He gonna cheat you if he can, but he gonna
tellyou it's a fair game. But don't no [j]man do that, no man gamble
fair. Hands always faster than a man's eye. When a man be gamblin,
you see, why, when everybody , they see you lucky and winnin, they
gonna try and find out how you win. Everybody will try to find out.
You play green and lucky, say he's a hard-workin boy, but he prat'ly
break everybody comin along. Everybody play a workin man as a fool,
everybody, everybody you see -- s[g]torekeeper, the barbe shop ,the tailor -
everybody play a workin man as a fool. A workin man has a better show
for gamblin or hustlin or anyth ng like that than anybody else in the
world. Why? Because he'll get out and work hard. Ain't nobody watchin
him work. Your hand is always faster than your eye. Folks may not
believe that but while you can shuffle a deck of cards and cut, you cut
hand in one hand, and show anyplace you ain't got but two cards in that
hand. That's all. And you can carry a pat hand all the time.. When
that card come, just like this, you slide it right over the deck and
you fall out
