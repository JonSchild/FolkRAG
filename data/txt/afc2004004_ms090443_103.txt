and bisquits and _____ and I'd have have eggs and bacon and milk
and she sat down there and she be roaming in my hair, just playing
with me , you know, and I got to where I was crazy about her 

Her Mama done found out about it  and they just got up a little 10
x 12 camp cause we didn't need nothing but a bed and a heater 
cause we ate right at the kitchen.  Well I worked out there . . . 

AL:Did Gertrude consider that she ws sort of married to you.  Did you 
all talk all that over? 
WB:No.  She and I slept out when we wanted to see each other.  But
she and I were the onl[t]y two single people in the camp.  She was
young and I was young so they decided that they should put us
together.  They had a man in there with a wife and four or five
children named Nathan.  He was a wheeler loader and he went for bad.
He had forced us out 2 or three times.  She told me about  it . 
Every bod y in the camp had pistols.  Some had two.  I had a 41 Colt
single action rawside you had to slap it to shoot the _____ and me and Mr.
Brown would go to hunt.  He furnished the gun.  And he would come [o]to
camp and he would say, "Little Man is about the best shot I ever
been hunting with."  He would shoot about 25 or 30 shells and he'd 
kill 6 or 8 quail and I'd go up there and if I made 10 shots, I had
8 or 9 quail.  He used to buy me shells.  So after we got together,
everybody paid off.  .  .  

AL:You got off Gertrude.  I want to here more about her.  You told
me about this paying off before .  Tell me more about this Gertrude.
