Let's do our best to fight the werts, the Amoretts of the rising sun.
Who are dirty its true, by issuring a murderos deed on the 7th of Dec. 1941.
We will sacrifice all, our boy's they did call, to help and serve in a capacity. But we hope when victory is won, we won't have the back end of the gun, and forever here, suffer in a free democracy. We are looking fo zest load of happiness, freedom of a real citizenship we pray. That our homes may be free, our children as we. In Uncle Sam good old U.S.A.

"Waste makes those thing we want most unobtainable, so economise and save what you have."

Gather up the scraps, so we can beat the Jap's. The unfair group of murdeous thru.

Buy bond every payday to save our fighting men.
