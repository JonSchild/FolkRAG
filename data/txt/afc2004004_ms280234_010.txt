TAPE 59: SEan McDonagh: Micky Cronin:
Calum Brugh: Sean McDonagh:
1) In Dublin's fair city the sun it was setting,
The IRA assembled, their fight to renew,
They cheered their commander, old Ireland's great defender,
For an Easter week revival, was the famous Calum Brugh.

2) And may God rest the soul of our true old Irish patriot,
To his faith and his country until death he was true,
And may God rest the soldiers who folow in his footsteps,
And remember "No surrender," were the last words of Brugh.

The Queen of Connemara: Sean
1) O my boats can safely float in the teeth of wind and weather,
And outrace the fastest hooker between Galway and Kinsail,
When the black foam of the ocean and the white foam rush together,
Aye, she rides in her pride like a seagull through the gale.
Chorus:
O she's neat, o she's sweet, she's beauty everyline,
The Queen of Connemara is the bounding bark of mine.

2) When shes loaded down with fish till the water leaps her gunnel,
Not a drop she'll take aboard her that would wash a fly away,
From the fleet she sips so swiftly like a greyhound from her kennel
Till she lands a silvery store of fish at Inverchale.

3) There's a light shines out afar and it keeps me from dismay,
With the skies               above us, and the sea runs white with foam
In a cot in Connemara there's a wife and wee one praying,
To the one who walked the waters once, tobring us safely home.

Green Broom: Sean
1) There was a man and he lived in the East
And his trade it was cutting down broom, green broom,
He had one son, his name it was John,
And he stayed in bed till noon-day-noon,
And he stayed in bed until noon.

2) The father arose and up to John goes,
And swore he would burn his room, gay room,
If he didn't rise and sharpen his knives
And go down to the wood to cut brooms.
