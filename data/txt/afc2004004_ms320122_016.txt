made in 17, 1716 it was. . .
A. LOMAX  Wow.  That must be valuable.
That must be a. . .
MR. FOUGET  Oh, I went to old man [Fitz
Parlin] in [Crowley], I wanted something fixed on it.  He
said you know how much that violin is worth?  I said no.  He
said that violin is worth $10,000 the way it is.
A. LOMAX  Just a second.
MR. FOUGET  He said if you let me fix it
it's going to be worth twice that much.  But years back, you
know, when it come here. . .
A. LOMAX  These old tunes. . . .
MR. FOUGET  . . .like I would say well just
like if I liked the tune well they'd say that's the Fouget
Waltz or Fouget Two-Step, or something like that.  Or the
South [Wa] Two-Step or the South, South [Wa] Waltz.  That's
all the name they'd give.  They didn't know any name.  Then
they'd start singing like, start singing [Jolie Blanc].  But
I was playing that a long time before they start with Jolie
Blanc.  And all them, they give all the name like, [old
Dennis,] he's  got a name for every tune.  Some of them don't
even. . .[LAUGHS]. . .well I better not say that.
A. LOMAX  But you were saying how he and 
[Almadee] they got recording first, and how  they got started
recording.
