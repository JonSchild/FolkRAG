I  This become a hell of a world war 
Hitler find Turkey in Greece.  

II  Cannons to the left of them. 
Cannons to the right of them 
cannons in front of them & cannons behind them. 
They fought & fought well, yes they fought like hell, 
As they fought & some fell in the ditch, one man 
cried here's to Hitler the Son of a bitch.
