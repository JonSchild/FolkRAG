Dear Mrs. Banks
Dear Mrs. Banks,

Let me congratulate you
on the excellence of the series you finish this
week on the third. I had intended writing
you before but I have been so busy with work
for the horch? and a TV programme for
Norman Swallow. Either Laurence Gilliam or Geoffrey
Fridson? will tell you that a folk-song pro-
gramme such as you've just done would draw
me like a magnet. 
I've always been interested in folk
song, naturally, old Durham mining songs, in
particular. The Negro slave and the Durham miner
0f the 1800's had much in common, and
slaves even sought solace in song. Listen to 
a Southerner? in the cotton fields singing " Sail Away"?
and a miner in the pub singing "??"
and at once you can see the relationship. But
the similarity of mining and Negro ballads is
not merely founded on a similar life of drudgery
and toil but upon? the rescue? of immigration. Around
about 1840 whole Durham mining villages went to
America, and the rescue?, - you got what
Frank Collinson delights in calling a "Variant".
"If your from Alabama or Linnescu? or Carolina
any place below the Mason-Dixon line"
The very word Dixie originated only a
few miles from here.
