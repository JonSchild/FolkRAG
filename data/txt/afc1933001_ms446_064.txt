Let music charm me last on earth,
     And greet me first in heaven.

Then round my senseless clay
     Assemble those I love,
And sing of heaven, delightful heaven,
     My glorious home above.

THE OLD CHURCH YARD

Oh, come, come with me, to the old church-yard,
I well know the path through the soft green sward;
Friends slumber there, we were wont to regard,
We'll trace out their names, in the old church-yard.
Oh, mourn not for them, their grief is o'er,
Weep not for them, they weep no more,
For deep is their sleep, though cold and hard
Their pillows may be in the old church-yard.

I know it seems vain, when friends depart,
To breathe kind words to the broken heart;
I know that the joys of life seem marred,
When we follow frinds to the old church-yard.
But were I at rest, beneath 'yon tree,
Why should you weep, dear friends, for me?
I'm wayworn and sad, O, why then retard
The rest that I seek un the old church-yard?

Our friends linger there, in sweetest repose,
Released from the world's sad bereavements and woes;
And who would not rest with the friends they regard
In quietude sweet, in the old churchyard.
We'll rest in the hope of that bright day,
When beauty shall spring from the prison of clay,
When Gabriel's voice and the trump of the Lord,
Shall awaken the dead in the old church-yard.
