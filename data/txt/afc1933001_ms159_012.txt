Dear Alan:
All of the records I have on Leadbelly are over in New York.
I hope that by the end of the week, I can get a complete set
of them off to you. The majority of those with the Golden
Gate I liked. A few seem to lack spirit and precision.
I hope the check matter will not cause you any further worry.
Sincerely yours,
R.P. Wetherald
