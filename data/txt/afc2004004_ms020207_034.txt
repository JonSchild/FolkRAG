Reverebd Roe. "eel 9.   P.3
but if it's truth, you just better say so. [Of course, with them, you know] Because whatever is done,[know, it's done] you know it['s] just coming to [life] light. 
A: Of course, ministers are particularly sorry afterwards about women, 
for spiritual reasons, and so the temptation is --
R: Yes, we hates it; we don't want to yeild to those temptations, but 
being in contact all the time, and there is some women that you'll 
meet in your life, that you can't hardly stand, [that] you have to keep 
away from em; [you] just have to avoid them some way or other. It's 
hard, and I think, as a man, you know that yourself. Well, it's 
natural with the preacher just like it is with you. And now the only 
difference might be, he wouldn't yield [like] maybe as quick as you would. But 
most every man that's living has a [preaching] breaking point. Therefore, we got 
to be very careful.
A: Would you say that women are more interested in preachers than 
[*Women interested in preachers?*]
they are in [other] ordinary men?
R: [I would say so] Mostly so; yes, sir, they are. And I've noticed this: you can 
go to a place and run a [succession] successful [about] a revival [in which] You preach 
well and satisfy the people well, there'll be some women more than 
one, generally [that'll] will try to tempt you, and you have to be pretty 
strong. Generally you may be away from home for weeks conducting revival, and at a time like that, if you ain't mighty careful, you [may]'ll fall. It's a temptation, and hard [for a man] to bear sometime. 
A: That would be may be some of [them?] leading women of the church.
R: Generally so, yes sir, generally so. And they offer you some temptation, at times and it's hard say for instance for a women will go to work and put on some kind of a project and raise you some money, maybe buy you a nice [set] suit of clothes, dress you up, and everything like that, and 
when after she did some much for you, why then, she kinda in a way offers herself to you, and she's been so good to you, you got to be mighty strong now to hold. If you don't mind things will snap.
