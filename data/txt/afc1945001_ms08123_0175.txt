U.S.S. Arizona
This story was told to me by a sailor
who was on the U.S.S. Arizona. He said
that one evening about six o'clock when
their boat was on patrol somewhere in
the Pacific, there was a dead unlife like
mist around their ship. All they could hear
was the smooth running motors of their
ship, and the splashing of the water 
against its' sides.
All of the boys who were not
on duty were down below; some were
sleeping, and others were playing games.
All of a sudden the alarm screamed
out. Enemy Sub "sighted." 
In a split second everyone 
was at his station ready for action. 
The navigators and sounders were 
trying to get the exact location of the 
suber marine.
