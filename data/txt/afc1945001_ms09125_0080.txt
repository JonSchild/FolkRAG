1. A general in Hitler's army had a
girl friend.  Lately she was avoiding
him and wouldn't go out with him. So
the general thought and thought of what
the matter could be. Then all at once
it dawn on him that she was going
out with someone else.  So he said to
himself, I know what I'll do, I'll put
some itching powder on her and in her
clothing, and whoever she goes with
they'll get it on them.  So he put the 
powder on her and in her clothing.

The next morning, when the general
was drilling his squad, he saw a man
scratching himself. He said, ah, there's the
man that goes out with my girl.  He
looked around and saw another man
scratching and pretty soon, the whole
squad was scratching themselves.  The
general said oh, my goodness, the whole
squad is going out with my girlfriend,
I must go and tell Hitler. So, he ran into
Hitler's office and said, Hitler my whole
squadron is going out with my girl.
Hitler said, yea, (All the while he was scratching)
