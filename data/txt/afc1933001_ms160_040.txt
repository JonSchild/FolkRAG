[1940-08]

We feel that a pamphlet, containing a succinct account
of the [Star] origin of the Star Spangled Banner, [is] should be
issued at this time. Aside from scatter short accounts, there
are two books devoted entirely to this subject - the Sonneck
Report of 1914 and Joseph Muller's Bibliography, issued in 1935.
Both books are [useful] still useful, but much as been turned up
since the Report was issued, and it could easily stand a revision.
In any case, both works are too long and technical for read
reference or popular use.

The proposed pamphlet, although based on the best information
available and designed on strictly scholarly lines, should
primarily strive for readability, and clear simplicity. A strictly 
factual account of this sort would make the pamphlet of permanent
value and help to avoid the stigma of "propaganda."

The text should cover the origins of the tune, the composition
of the words (with sufficient historical background to fit the 
defence of Fort McHenry into the War of 1812), and a very brief
account of the subsequent history of the song - noting particularly
significant changes in the tune and the Act of Congress
which made it our national song. Sufficient illustrations should 
be employed to make the account vivid -- a portrait of Key, our
copy of the first broadside, the manuscript, the first printed
music, a map of the region, etc. At the end should come a straight-forward piano
arrangement of the [tune] music with a good version of the words.
As a special supplement, special arrangements of this version 
should be made available for full orchestra, theater orchestra, 
dance band, military band, and concert band.
