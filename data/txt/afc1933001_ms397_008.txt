are attempts, often crude and sometimes vulgar, to epitomize and particularize
the life of the pioneers who peopled the vast region west of the
Mississippi river.
Such early pioneer ballads do exist. Already I have collected
nearly a hundred. I wish to colicit your aid in preserving from extinction
this expression of American literature. Eventually it is expected
that the ballads will be published in book form and made available
for students of history or for those interested in the songs merely
as an expression of romantic western life.
An editorial request from you to your readers for copies of frontier
songs will doubtless result in valuable material. I shall greatly
appreciate your help to this extent, and your further favor in forwarding
to me whatever material may come into your hands.
May I add that ballads, and the like, which because of crudity,
incompleteness, coarseness, or for any other reason are unavailable for
publication, will be as interesting and as useful for my purposes as others
of more merit. It is my desire to collect the songs and ballads now or
lately in actual existence and in the precise form which they have popularly
assumed.
Yours very respectfully,
JOHN A. LOMAX.
Associate Professor of English."
