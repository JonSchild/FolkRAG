LETTERS OF JOHN LOMAX

1/15/39
Port Aransas, Texas

To: Harold Spivacke, Music Division, Library of Congress

My dear Spivacke:
I sent several of my library friends my unique, jingling,
revealing Christmas card in the confident belief that, at least,
you or your more discerning lady would appreciate its
appropriateness and individuality to such a degree that you would
send a word of acknowledgment. Nary a word, which further
confirms my long held belief that all Christmas cards are worse
than useless, futile and that they should be abolished by act of
Congress.

I write especially to inform you that unless you and Alan,
either or both, tell me that you can loan me a recording machine
I shall be forced to buy one, the product of which I shall not
feel obligated to turn over to the Library of Congress. Also, I
wish to enquire whether you think the Music Division of the
Library, with its various charming officials, could stand the 
strain of the presence of Miss Terrill and myself for a few
months? A little later, when the fishing is not so good and the
fiddler crabs too busy with their babies to furnish their nightly
concerts, we may come up. Till then, and later, believe me, in
high esteem, believe me, always sincerely.
John Lomax
