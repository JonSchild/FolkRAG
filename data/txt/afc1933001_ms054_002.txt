Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter to Mr. Latham comes to me in his absence
on his annual trip to Europe. I am glad to know that you are planning
the extra material for the COWBOY SONGS and AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK
SONGS, and I shall be looking forward to its receipt as soon as it is ready.

I wish that I could hold out hope of our being able to
increase the size of the second AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS. Unfortunately, 
however, the same reasons which prompted us to urge you
to confine it to the length contracted for still hold, and I sincerely
hope that you will be able to do so without too great sacrifice of the
material.

Cordially yours,
James Putnam

Mr. John A. Lomax
