F-W  Grade 10
1. All the meat is rationed in Germany,
in fact all the dogs are gone, except one
and all the Germans are debating who's
going to kill it. Heil Hitler!
2. Buy stamps, buy bonds
Build up moral, cheer 'em on,
3. Rain, storm, hail, thunder,
Adolf soon will be six feet under
4. Japan's sun is going down, maybe 
that's the answer for the dimout.
