Yes, any time it was a quiet night, out to the Lincoln
Park, which I before stated, it was at least about ten or twelve miles
from the corner where we used to hand out -- maybe an affair
wasn't so well publicized.  So, in order to get it publicized
in a few seconds, old Buddy would first take his big trumpet and
turn it around towards the city and blow this very tune that I'm 
talking about.  In other words the tune was "I thought I
Heard Buddy Bolden Say" and  the whole town would know that
Buddy was there, and in a few seconds, why, the parks would
start to get filled.  It was nothing for Buddy to fill any
place that you could hear his horn during those times.  Oh,
I heard him up until he went to the crazy house.  Later he 
went to the crazy house.
But I had an opportunity to be in the Jackson Hall
once when he was playing at some matinee -- a holiday -- and there
was a man standing at the stationary bar -- a little bit of a 
short fellow.  Seemingly he was sick, had rheumatism, and a 
great big husky guy steps on his foot and I was just between
[?] and they got into an argument and the little bit of guy
didn't want to stand for it and just pulled out a great big
gun, almost as long as he was old, and shot, and, if I hadn't
pulled my stomach back he would've shot me in the stomach.
He killed this guy, laying on the floor, and, my goodness,
Buddy Bolden started blazing away -- he was up on the balcony,
bandstand and started blazing away for all he was worth in
