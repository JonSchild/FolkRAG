Soph. N. M. 

1. One fellow said he was out looking for a warm WAAC
and ran into a cold WAVE. 

2. The judge asked the officer, who had just 
brought in a drunk off the street, what 
was the charge?
"The charge your honor, stated the officer 
is being lit up during a black out."

3. Got a dime in my pockets,
    Got a place to eat and sleep,
    I'm HF in the army,
    Cause I got flat feet. 

4. One fellow rushed in and said, "hurry and help 
me pack my bags, I'm about to fly into a tantrum." 
The other fellow blurted out, "a p-38 is faster."

5. One fellow said, "I'll sell you this handkerchief 
for $100.00"
"Why so much," said the other.
"It's the only thing Hitler would let 
Mussolini stick his nose in," he answered.
