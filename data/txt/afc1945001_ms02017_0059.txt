"We thought the 'Wall Street' days were over- but the American dollar 
has done it again and your boys and my boys - the common clay who really 
make up the nation - can pay for a mere handful of money mongers." 
(Professional man, Birmingham, 8/5/42.)

III. Inflation Control.

"There's plenty of sugar - no reason to ration it." (Business man,
Birmingham, 8/7/42.)

"I get more sugar now than I ever had before and the grocers say they 
have plenty of it. I don't think rationing is necessary. I got 16 
pounds of sugar at one time, using our rationing cards, and that is 
more sugar than I ever bought before in my life. I got it just because 
I could." (Housewife, Birmingham, 8/6/42.)

"Within 6 months we'll be out of meat for civilian use. Meat is 
already being preserved with embalming fluid." (Veteran of last war, 
Birmingham, 8/5/42.)

"Plenty of synthetic rubber could be made if Standard Oil didn't want 
a monopoly." (Business man, Birmingham, 8/7/42.)

"Plenty of synthetic rubber could be made if politics weren't playing 
such a strong hand." (Businessman, Birmingham, 8/7/42.)

"Plenty of sugar - it's being rationed so we'll know we're in a war." 
(Street car passenger, Birmingham, 8/6/42.)
