RUN, LITTLE DOGIES*
As I looked out of my window
I saw a cowboy come riding along
His hat shoved back and his spurs kept a'jinglin'
And as he drew near, he was singing this song.
Chorus:               xxxxxxx
Hush 'e ciola**, little baby, lie easy
Who's your real father may never be known
Oh it's weepin' and wailin', rockin' the cradle
And tending a baby that's none of your own. 
When spring comes along, we round up the dogies
We stick on their brands and we bob off their tails
Pick out the strays, then the heard is inspected
And then the next day we go on the trail. xxxxxx
Chorus: 
[x'd out
Singing Hoop---p-i--o---hoop; Run along, you little dogies
 For Montano will be our new home
Oh, it's whooping, swearing, driving the dogies
It is our misfortune wherever we roam
It is worst in the night just after a roundup
When dogies are grazin' in the herd all around
You have no idea of the trouble they give us
The boys who are holding them on the bed-ground
Hoop---p-i-o-hoop! Run along you little dogies
For Montana will be your new home
Oh, its whooping, swearing, driving the dogies
It is our misfortune wherever we roam
Oh, some men think we go on the trail for pleasure
But I can tell them that they are dead wrong
If I ever got any fun out of trailing
I'd have no reason for singing my song. Chorus.
*This version of Whopee-Ti-Yi-Yo
Get along little dogies was learned
by Francis Sullivan, Washington, D.C.
in Idaho in the early part of the 
century.  It perhaps shows that this
cowboy song was derived from some
old Irish lullaby.  Mr. Sullivan insists
that it was sung by cowboys at night.
