Jean: No.
Lomax: What you found out - you found out how ? On your own?
Jean: Well, I suppose as we grew up it cameto us natural.
Lomax: You mean you learned from men?
Jean: Oh no. Oh no. What do you think I am?
Lomax: Every woman has a certain amount of contact with men.
Jean: In which way?
Lomax: Courting.
Jean: But of course, there's such a thing - you could court, you
could speak to somebody and yet not lay your body down to him.
Lomax: Is that the way you learned?
Jean: No, because I wouldna lay my body down to the first man I
ever saw unless I was married to him.
Lomax: Yes - but you can talk about sex with him.
Jean: No - never talked -- WHAT! Talk about sex with a man! Oh
no. I wouldna dream of such a thing. My own kind of people never
spoke about such a thing. Never heard it spoken about. What ever any
of them did when they were out sourting, or what they spoke about,
I don't know. But around the firesides or out about, we never heard
of such a thing.
Lomax: Of course, you certainly had a chance to come across such
things because there was no place to hide it - no doors, no locks.
You were all living in the open.
Jean: People was careful. We'd all have different places to ourselves.
Lomax: I've often wondered how married life went on in a one-roomed
caravan. with a married man and wife and children. How would married
life go ahead? I don't understand that.
Jean: You never thought they'd have another place for the children?
There were big camps up along with the caravans, with beds for the
children.
Lomax: Then the older folks sleep together in the caravan. . . .
Jean: Yes, and maybe the children slept in the camps. You don't
think hat our people would just lie helter-skelter throughit, you
know.
Lomax: Now at all.
