GUINEVERE

SHE dreams of time, long-fled, when she was young
And lovely as the moon;  her matchless brown
Unlined, her white and slender arms that clung
To him, once flame and passion, and of how
Her lips curved, taunting, poppy-red, desired
By all who gazed on her.  And yet she bid
Them only unto Lancelot, who fired
This madness, as good Arthur never did.
Oh ancient riddle of desire!  To be
So cursed!  With Lancelot disgraced, dismissed;
Her golden beauty shorn, in Almesbury, --
(Dear God, how long it was since last she'd kissed!)
   She twists her slender hands, while scalding tears
   Drop slowly, still, down all the bitter years.

MINUTIA

THESE sudden little beauties that I know --
Like twilight brushing softly past my hand,
The whispered sounds of spring within the land,
The mauve that is the sunset's afterglow,

Of these too fragile strands our lives are made,
Small, wordless things, their silence somehow flihgs
Soft rapture vibrant as the sound of wings
That beat across a bleak sky unafraid.
   -- ETHEL MARY FRANKLIN

NOCTURNE

SHE'S gone beyond the river that flows down
Mountain and marsh and southward to the sea,
Gone is the brightness sudden on the hills,
Days crawl from sun to sun and dismally
Stars to the west creak over.  Moon-mouth fills
Tardy, and waning, waits out eons.  Drown,
Hours.  Suck slow and strangle history
Planets, eclipse.  Wait out the dark and see
How clear light rises, turn of the year, when she,
Flinging the world in my arms, comes back to me.
