                                 OH LORD, I GOT A RIGHT

CHORUS #1:        Oh, Lord, I got a right, (3)
                            I got a right to the tree of life.

CHORUS #2:        I'm so glad I've got a right, (3)
                            I've got a right to the tree of life.

                            One day, one day, I was walkin' along,
(REFRAIN)            I got a right to the tree of life;
                            I heard a voice but I saw no one. (REFRAIN)  (CHORUS #2)

                            What you reckon it said to me?  (REFRAIN)
                           "I am soul and I'm set free."  (REFRAIN)

CHORUS #3:        I know, Lord, I got a right, (3)
                            I got a right to the tree of life.

CHORUS #4:        Oh, [yeah] yes, Lord, I got a right, etc.

                             If you don't believe I've been redeemed, (REFRAIN)
                             Follow me down by Jordan stream, (REFRAIN)  (CHORUS #3 & #4)

                             Whatcha gonna do and whatcha gonna say?  (REFRAIN)
                             You'll wake up some mornin', it's Judgment day.  (REFRAIN)
                                                                                                   (CHORUS #4)

                             Some of these days about twelve o'clock,  (REFRAIN)
                             This old world is gonna reel and rock.  (REFRAIN)
                                                                                                     (CHORUS #3)
