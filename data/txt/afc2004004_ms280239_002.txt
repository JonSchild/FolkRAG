Tape 31...Calum Johnstone....Life on Barra. Recorded and
interviewed by Alan Lomax.

Calum: ....About his sailing days---but he was fishing at
home the latter years of his life, and he used to go to
Glasgow and work during the winters, and return home and
carry on with the lobster fishing.  That's what he was at--
while my mother, she was just like all the other mothers in
the place.  When the father was away, she would carry on
herself, and then with the help of the family just work the
croft and keep things going.

Lomax: How big a place was it she lived on?  How big a croft?

Calum: It was just the croft you've seen in the glen.  We
used to keep two cows and two stirrucks and a pony.

Lomax: How much land was there?

Calum: Well, in acreage...it's difficult to say...about
six or seven acres perhaps, altogether.  There wasn't very
much.

Lomax: What did you raise on this?

Calum: O we just raised --- we kept --- we had two cows for
providing milk and butter, and there were some sheep, and
the pony was for work on the land, manuring the land and
carrying the peats and things like that.  And of course, a
croft like that wouldn't keep a family going; somebody
had to leave home and work elsewhere you see.  Some of my
sisters were away, and my brother, eventually he was a
sailor, -- he also started in square rig, and eventually
he landed in Australia, and from there to Tasmania, where
he was a lightkeeper for many years, and he died there.

Lomax: So you didn't see him again?

Calum: I didn't see him again, no.  He left just shortly before
I left.  I left home when I was about sixteen years of age.  He
was away before then.

Lomax: But always sending money back.

Calum: Yes, that's so, and keeping the place going.  Well,
my sister Annie was a teacher; she helped to keep the place
going also; and other members of the family also helped.

Lomax: How many of you were there?
