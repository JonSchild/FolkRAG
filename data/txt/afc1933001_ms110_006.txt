Eagle Nest,N.M.
 Aug.22,1940

Dear Alan,

                     We were terribly sorry to miss your broadcast. 
We made arrangements to listen in on a radio down at the 
village, even though static is bad in these mountains until 
the night hours; but a gully-washing rain left the dirt 
roads so slick that we did not dare try to drive them.
 I wrote Mike, our house-boy, who always enjoys your programs
 and asked him to tell tye Sharps and the Shumates, but a
 letter from him today says that my card arrived too late. 
He tells us also that the Sharps are moving to their farm 
near Garland. We shall certainly miss them, though I suppose
 we shall not have a real opportunity to miss them until
 Christmas time or later, if we are to be away all the time 
allowed by the Library setup. We hope that the girls will
 tell us about your program, as we are expecting them and the
 children and the maid tomorrow.  I'm afraid they will not have
 a very good time as the autumn rains seem to have set in 
the last few days.  We always expect a shower in the afternoon,
 but this week there has been as much rain as sunshine. 
It is a beautiful spot when the sun has a chance, znd my
 sister's cabin has a glorious view of Eagle Nest Lake and the
 mountains beyond of the Cimmarron Canyon and Pass.

    Though your father has been considerably annoyed 
by his skin ailment even in this cool spot, yet he has worked
 consistently and has written several chapters of Adventures. 
We shall leave here the first of next week for Dallas to
 make necessary preparations for the trip.  I feel much 
honored to have my name included officially in the appropriation, 
and I shall do my best to earn my keep, both on the road
 and in Washington. We are expecting Bess to go part of the way 
with us.  Won't that be fun?  She is certainly a beautious creature 
and has worked like a Trojan to finish up two whole years 
of German.  She has been invaluable to Shirley this summer and 
Chris reports that she has been "perfect".

       I am eager to keep good notes on our trip.  Would 
you be good enough to take time out to give me an outline 
of the plan you follow?  I remember that Mr. Seeger's folks - 
or was it that other fellow who gave a record recital in the 
Dept. of Interior the night of the prize fight? Well. anyway I
 saw an outline that seemed to me very complicated, but on the 
whole fruitful of suggestions. I'd like our reports to be 
consistent in outline with yours, so far as the character of 
the material will allow.
