I.  I loved to read about Moses
God called him out one day
And said "I want you Moses
To show my folks the way; Moses did obey,
And how God worked that day,
It's God sending judgment on man.
CHORUS
God's sending judgment on man,
God's sending judgment on man,
He is showing men today
They must take the Christ way;
It's God sending judgment on man.

II.  The Lord talked with Moses,
That's what we understand,
And said: "I want you Moses to take the children
out of Pharoah's hand,
And if he don't let them go, then I will my power
show;"
It's God judgment on Man.
CHORUS

III. So Moses went to Egypt, way down in Pharoh's land
And prophesied. destruction would be on every hand
Pharoah would not obey,
How the Lord did work that day;
It's God sending judgment on man.
CHORUS

IV.  You see God gave Moses wisdom and knowledge from
on high
But Pharoah would not give up the folks,
And of course he had to die;
God opened up the sea and drowned them so free
It's God sending judgment on man.
CHORUS

V.  There is many modern Pharoahs, as was in the days
of old,
That uses all of their power, the nations to control
But they shall not prevail,
Their plan is bound to fail
It's God sending judgment on man.
CHORUS

VI.  All hands shall be feeble, knees shall be weak,
All of their gold and silver shall be cast in the streets
And none shall be able to deliver them out of His
hand;
It's God sending judgment on man
CHORUS

VII.  Our whole Christian nation is plunging into disgrace,
Abomination which maketh desolate,
Standing in the Holy place,
Whosoever readeth let him understand;
It's God sending judgment on man.
CHORUS

VIII.  The system is corrupted, according to God's own
word,
Become a habitation of devils and a cage of unclean
birds
Most everybody belongs to church,
Still the world is growing worse;
It's God sending judgement on man.
