BJ:  Really (Millen -?-), Sam Palmer, prettiest man I have ever
seen since I been born.  He's he was a white man.  He was the mayor
of the town.  An' he, and' his chillun go in his name.  He had a
woman named, ah, oh, I tol' ya about it, was name, ah, Ada
Black an' they started to set their house on fire.  It's on;
you already got it down.  An' ah, an' so, that was in Millen,
too.  An' he was a pretty man.  He had three girls by one colored 
woman, called Ada Black.  An', an' ah, so they got behind her
an', ah, him, ya know, an' about her, an' so they couldn't
do anything about, about that, an' so, ah, they was gonna burn
Ada out.  [An'] Gonna have, gonna have some colored folks ta burn
'er out. [You know] An' see, they had a colored man lookin' out for her
all the time.  This man come an' told Sam about it; he heard
about it; they was gonna burn 'er out. 
     Said, "All right."  So he went on an' had this colored man
to get, ah, Ada away from there, an' how he got 'er away
nobody don't know.  But Ada got away from there.  They burnt
that house down that night an' they stood [right] 'round there an' they
looked.  They know [he] Ada had to come out that house.  They looked
in the ashes an' no Ada.  Next thing they know, Ada was in 
Augusta.  See?  An' the chillun all, a co'se the chillun wasn't 
there that night.  They took good pains not to wanna burn the chillun
up, see?  'Cause that was that white man's chillun, see.  They
