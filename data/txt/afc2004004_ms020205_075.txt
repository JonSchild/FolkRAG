Reverend Roe - Reel 2 - P. 2

making that report each month, and a woman came to take her place after she
had to leave and go home, and she invited me out to help her as she hadn't
been accustomed to that, you know. I went out there that night and I stayed
till I guess round eleven o'clock, and I started home. I was bachin' it;
my wife had gone, you know. And I got a little ways from her house and for
some cause, I don't know, I looked back and there was a light shinin, the
rays of a light, across the road behind me. It kinda made me feel funny
because I could look each way, couldn't see no light and I couldn't see why
there would be the rays of a light and there was no light. I went on,

ought to pulled off your shoes." And I said, "Lord, you know, I didn't know."
That's what I said. I got back in it, but I never did think about pulling
my shoes off, and I prayed again, and then when I got up and walked out of it
again, I walked a little piece and looked back, and it was still there. I
walked a few more steps and I looked back, and it was gone. I went on
home.
