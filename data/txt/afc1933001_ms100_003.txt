Dear Miss Watson:

  I regret that we do not have on hand a brief outline of Mr. John Lomax' life, but we can refer you to an article on him which appeared in the READER'S DIGEST for last October, 1945. That article, in turn, was a digest of a somewhat larger story which appeared in the SATURDAY REVIEW OF LITERATURE, to which reference is made in the DIGEST account.

  We are enclosing a checklist of books on American Folk music and you will find there that John Lomax has published other books than the songs of the cattle trail to which you refer.

  It occurs to us that Mr. Lomax himself might be pleased to know of your interest in his work and would be willing, if he has the time, to supplement the data which you collect with some personal account of his own. He may be addressed at 8710 San Benito Way, Dallas, Texas.
                       
                                           Sincerely yours,
 
                                             Duncan Emrich
