3. These kind of melodies are few and far between. They
are just the ones that particularly appeal to me, while they
might not be favorites of other people. Therefore, if I
am given the right to select out fifteen per cent of the
songs for my exclusive use for as long as I may want them
that would be more in line with the work I am doing as
a composer. That is where my chief interest lies. Unless
I could have the exclusive use of a small percentage of the
songs which I collect, I would have very little enthusiasm
for the work. Do you think this is unreasonable?
      By the way, in the event I use the funds of the Foundation
what is the customary carge to turn in for automobile
mileage? Ho much per mile?
     The recording machine would have to be shipped to me
at Monroe, Louisiana, 1503 Milton Street in care of my
brother C.V. McGimsey who is an expert electrical engineer
and could help me set it up etc. I will of course employ
a man to help me operate it if necessary.
      While here in San Antonio I am going to look up some
Mexican songs and record any that seem to be interesting if
I can. At Muskogee I recorded some Indian songs and
among them one lullaby that was rather haunting.
      Give me your advices by air mail if possible addressing
me in care of my brother B. B. McGimsey, 304 Westover Road,
San Antonio, Texas. I will be here about ten days.
      With personal regards and best wishes, I am,
Very sincerely,
Robert MacGimsey.
