When I was turning in my occupational 
questionairre a young 18-year old 
registrant was having his filled out.
Evidently, he was an illiterate.  

The member of the advisory board 
was patienly asking him the many 
questions and writing the answers 
laboriously on the form.-- 

"Are you a conscientious objector?" 
His only answer was a blank 
stare -- and finally. "Huh?" 

He repeated "Are you a conscientious 
objector?" 

Answer: "Jeez, I don't know!"  

The registrar, by now completely 
exasperated "Look, buddy, if 
a guy came up to you on the 
street and hit you in the mouth, 
would you hit him back?" 

Answer: "Hell yes!" 

The poor tired man quickly 
scribbled a positive "No" on 
the questionairre and went on 
to the next page.
