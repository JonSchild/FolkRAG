Colonel Dunkle
Fort Myer
Virginia

Dear Colonel Dunkle:

Everyone who heard the program Monday 
night was very enthusiastic about it. I've just 
received a charming letter from Mrs. Roosevelt, 
herself, expressing her appreciation for it. I 
hope that it will mean, in the end, more music 
recreation for enlisted men in the military services.

Thank you for your personal kindness 
to me and for your help in making this evening 
a successful one.
 
Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
