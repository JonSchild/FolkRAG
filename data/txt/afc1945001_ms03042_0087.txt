- 13 - Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York 8-18-42

Army and Navy Commissions
New York 8-14 (Hunter college student): "It makes me sick the
way to Army and Navy take girls from the 'best' colleges before they'll
take brilliant students from our college, which is the biggest in the world.
The WAACS and WAVES both have top officers from the 'best' colleges."
New York 8-12 (Woman executive): "The cheif officers of the
Army and Navy auxilaries should certainly have higher rank and pay. Why
shouldn't there be a woman general? Few generals do as much as Mrs. Hobby."
Albany 8-11 (Railroad ticket agent): "I got turned down for
a commission. I should move to Park Avenue, New York, and get drunk at the
Stork Club. That's how officers are chosen."
Syracuse 8-15: "My son is still a second lieutenant, and he's
been in longer than Elliot Roosevelt. I guess Elliott will be taking
General Marshall's job within a year. Daddy would like that." 
New York 8-13: "Give me a top-notch lad with every qualification,
and an anemic playboy from society, and I'll bet on the second one for a
Navy commission any day. They just take off evening clothes and put on an
ensign's uniform."
New York 8-12 (Army lietenant): "Yes, I'm from West Point, although
we don't call it that. Yes, we get promoted pretty fast. We study for four
hard years to get that right. We aren't Knudsens or Roosevelts."
New York 8-10: "No Jews can get commisions any more, no matter
how long they go to officer's training school. You watch the lists."

Labor Matters
New York 8-15 (Broker): "Do you need more proof that labor controls
the White House? Anytime a plant can't give a wage increase, the President orders the plant taken over, to blackmail the pwner into giving the money.
That's labor dictatorship."
