Dear Alan:

When our folklore group meets, when we
gather informally in our living room -- indeed, I
suppose when any group assembles + there is a common
desire to sing, is there a good book, with words + music,
of the best known American ballads + folksongs
that could guide us in our singing? I mean good
typical texts as actually found widely current in
our folklore, with music the same way, that has
not been tampered with or "arranged," that have
really been selected by someone that actually
had at his command a much larger stock of songs,
so that he could select with real perspective + know
he was choosing the comparative best + the most
widely known + in its most current form. And I
mean one that accurately reflects in true proportion the
major elements of our mixed national stock, as, let
us say, in 100 songs: 30 English, 30 Irish, 20 Scotch, 10 
German, 5 Negro, 5 Spanish, or whatever the proportions
are, -- a true + comprehensive reflection of our national
folk culture, unified as possible + equally applicable everywhere.
If there is none such, why don't you make it?
I'm in the market, + I should think the U.S. Office of Education
ought to be, too, as well as state textbook commissions.
