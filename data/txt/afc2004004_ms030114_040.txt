Q: Did people dance than to that music?
A: Oh yeh, people danced.
Q: Did you play special music for the white people?
A: No, no more than I did for anybody else. There might be some slow
song that the white people like to hear me play such like "love trots".
Q: What did you think about the white people down South?
A: Well, since I'm up here and met down South I don't have any thoughts
about them at all.
Q: How about the old days?
A: I had to much experience about them than, 'cause my grandmother always
raided me up from white people. They always told me that it wasn't so
good to dwell around among white people's children. They loved to play
with me but my grandmother didn't like me to take up too much time
playing with the white children.
Q: Where was your mother and father when you were being brought up?
A: I couldn't tell you where my father was brought up.See , he got killed
before I could realize him too much.
Q: There's that song you sing - THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WENT BLIND
- what do you consider that? A gospel song?
A: It is a gospel statement.
Q: It sounds like a blues.
A: It ain't none.
Q: Is that about a specific time in your life?
A: Yes. Speaking about what happens in your life. How people put me aside.
You know?
Q: You thought that was because you were blind?
A: When I was coming up, it was so.
Q: You were blind from birth?
A: Yes. My grandmother said I taken some blind when I was three
weeks old. The doctor had something put in my eyes that was too strong
and that was what caused me to go blind.
Q: I thought you could tell shapes out of one eye?
A: I could tell the look of a person now but to tell who it is- I'm
not able to tell that.
Q: When did you write that song THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WENT BLIND?
A: Oh, that was a long time - in 1911.
Q: Which other songs that you have written date back to that period?
A: Well, I didn't know anything about writing songs back than.I just
caught some songs I heard people play and sing sometimes. After I started
travelling - thinking over my back life, my past life and the beginning
of my life- I brought them all up together- all that mattered about my life-
had me some time to wonder. A Man, good health, young- I couldn't admit
who would want me for anything. That used to worry me.But as I started
to travel I soon got out of that. You could tell when everybody would
see me walking down the street with a woman they wouldn't bite their
tongues at all. They asked " can't you do no better".You understand. They
thought it was a disgrace for a woman to be walking with a blind man.
They thought it a shame for a woman to take up time with a blind man.
Q: Why did you take up music?
A: Well when I took up music I couldn't tell why, even if a man had agun in my f[?]
'Cause I didn't know myself. Somethings I don't know now.
Q: When was the first time you heard a blues?
A: That broke out in 1910. I couldn't tell you where it come from.
I heard a fellow coming down the road one time picking the guitar and playing
what you call "the blues".
