War Jokes Enc.

A man came into a restaurant, ate
his supper and asked for a second cup of
coffee. The waitress said, "I'm sorry sir but
you can have but one cup of coffee." The man
said, I suppose if Roosevelt cam in here and
asked for a second cup of coffee, he would get it."
The waitress said, "you are wrong sir, President
Roosevelt would have enough sense not to ask for 
a second cup."
