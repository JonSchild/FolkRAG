This little hossy in the stable
One jumped out and skinned his nable
Is you all hid.
No no.
Way down yonder in jaybird town
Devil knocked my daddy down.
If you all hid
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, all hid.        PULL BACK TO SHOW DAVE
Then when nobody answered I go out and
catch um . . . . . . .
GALLOWAY
What does the mean about jabird town?
LOMAX
 That means white folks part of town.  Nora learned 
her lesson early from her daddy.  He told her don't fight
 back at 'em cause I couldn't protect you.  I love you just 
as hard . . . but I don't have the privilege of showin it . . . 
don't onterfere with um.  Nora never forgot.  She saw many 
who retreated from life to protect their pride.  There was 
Rafe Addison.
Now Rafe was a don't carish man.  Wouldn't pay no rent.  
He live in a dugout with his wife by the railroad track . . .
He want him a car so he took an old wagon and cut a hole 
in the floor and put his feet through and pushes on some thing 
looks like cranks and it turns the wheels, and honey, he just 
rides to town anytime he wants to singin:
Hey, hey boll weevil, where's your native home,
Way down in the bottom, mong the cotton and corn.
Tell me boll weevil, where you get your great long bill 
Way out in Texas among tyem Western hills . . .
Rafe used to come over and visit us.  Mama would him 
supper out in the yard and when the moon came up we'd build a fire 
out there and Rafe would sing us ald songs . . . . . .
Another man done gone
He has a long chain on
 He killed another man
 I don't know hwere he's gone . . . . . .
Mama would tell me, "If you keep on listening to those old blues 
of Rafe's the Devil's gonna get you, cause old Rafe's almost 
Satan on earth . . . .
