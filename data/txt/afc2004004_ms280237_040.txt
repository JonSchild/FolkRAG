Dec. 2, 1953, HarryCox, myflat, Londn.
Cox: He gotin       bad company, this chap did, and gogto poaching.
And he got transported.  And he got in with ano her gang, and they took him,
MW: But do yo think poaching is really wrong, Harry?
Cox: It depends on if theyget 'em.  The real trouble is that there never
should ha' been anything like that at all.  Thiigs were sent into this world free.  Why not.  They all made for anybody.  
If they get what they made (??) They made the laws up to do that.
The[y]se people made laws up, that's why yo can't get [no]anywhere.  These pheasants, they's
as good for you as they are anybody else.  And they made the law up
so you mustn't touch 'em.  That's what caused people to poach.  If they had the run, the world was free they
[had] ought to had the run, you could go out and get one if you want.  it.  Why not?
[*"O you musn't look on, look. outa that!"*]
Lomax: You mean, you think that the poor people should have as many
pheasants as the rich people? 
Cox: Yes.  I think the world was made for people to live in it, and why
should these big people have everything there is in it.  And you got to
keep a going to get them a living, and if it warnt for thelower class
they'd [won]'t have nothin.  They won't have their place, if it weren't for you.
Why, where would they be, where would they be if their people didn't keep
a [w]orkin doin a the land, gettin the stuff for 'em.  They'd have to come out
and do some theyself.  They can ride about in [--?] motor carsand you mustn't
look.  They have everything.  Big people do.  Lower people havonawthin.
You aint got a foot of ground to go walk on your own [(?)]
Lomax: Howdidit come to be like that do you suppose, Harry.  It didn't
start like that.  I mean, I don't suppose the good Lord made it that way,
do you think?
Cox: No.  When the worldwas made, whenit was made, then they made the laws, 
these others are what make thelaws.  If you goin do anything, you'll find
they'll make up another law to show you're wrong.  And [it will get passed.]. How you gonna get past um.
