BJ:        No, they didn' bother him.  They was warnded not to 
bother him.   The whole of the town -- you know, all the law in 
town -- he better not be bothered.   Because he hadn't a-done 
anything.    An' some of 'um didn' believe it.   An' the girl told 
the city that it wasn't him.
TL:        How many of those guys did the lynching?
BJ:        I don't know how many it was.  [But Uncle Gene] They don't know, 
either.  But I just know those folks was standin' there.  You 
know they'd have to be all kinda ol', just ol' nasty backwoods, ol' 
nasty critters, that's all.
TL:        I wonder if any of them [liked] loved that girl or sumpin?
BJ:        I 'spect they did. . .Yeah. . .They musta did.   But the boy 
ah, Uncle Gene said, the same year that he was leavin' there, said 
the boy's uncle, you know, and aunt, you know that come down there 
with them? -- said they was takin' them back [out the] down to bury 
(?) 'em, then.  'Cause that girl looked like they just run her crazy, 
'cause she tol' em, she kep' tellin' 'em, an' tellin' them, "Robert?  It 
wasn't Robert."   An' then another white man tol' 'em that he passed 
through the fiel' on his way goin' to his field, an' he seen 
Uncle Gene and Robert workin' at the same time that they say this 
happened.   But they wouldn't b'lieve that.   You know they just 
gonna have it their way; gonna (test their license); that was all.  
Jus' wanted sumpin' to                       to get a chance to get 
at either one of 'em, you know.   That was that.   Then they said, 
"Maybe that black soandso will leave here now."   'Cause, see, 
he was livin' [in town] kinda all right and doin' all right.  [Wasn't] Doin' 
[a miracle for what] better than many of them poor folks was, you know, in there, but he [was
doin all right.  He raised plenty] didn'               none of 'em.  
He raised plenty; he was goin' to have things jus' like, jus' 
like anybody else.   Jus' like we all always did do.   Didn' 
need things; they could get meats from 'em -- whole hams an' things, 
on credit if they want to.   An' chickens!   By the hauls (?)  
'Cause I know I ha' been down there an' they jus' load up chickens 
in the, ah, truck, y'know.   I call it a truck but it was a wagon.  
In the wagon; they carry 'em to town an' sell 'em.  Some of 'em 
ain' got the money.   An' they stayed up & sell 'em.  How 
many people, [they] didn't pay [me, no.] 'em, you know.  Specially them white ones 
that didn't like [me] 'im nohow."   You see?   Jus' scratch it up.   Great,
