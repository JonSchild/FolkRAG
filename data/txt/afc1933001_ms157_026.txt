Mr. Sterling Fisher

Dear Sterling:
I am distributing the outlines for the folk music series of the School
of the Air of the Americas to the members of our staff Radio Committee
and will also send it to some of the officials of the National Music
Educators Conference which is now a department of the NEA.
In connection with the difficulty I have frequently heard mentioned of
getting much folk music out of South America, I would like to refer you
to Professor Manuel Beltroy of the Instituto Cultiral Peruano-Norteamericano,
Lima, Peru, who was a guest recently at the reception here for
the Eighth American Scientific Congress. Folk music of South America,
particularly in Peru, is a special hobby with him. He assured me that
there was much of it to be obtained in this country and that it had been
pretty well catalogued from the time of the Incas to the present. He
put special emphasis upon the time of the Incas  and said that it
would be quite possible to use percussion and wind instruments in playing
it similar to those which were used originally by the Incas themselves.
I asked Professor Beltroy to call to see Alan Lomax at Congressional
Library and he promised me that he would do so. However,
these delegates were feted to death here and it may be that he failed
to make a trip to the Library as he planned. If there is time to do so,
I think it would pay us to write to this professor.
Sincerely
Belmont Farley
Director of Publicity
