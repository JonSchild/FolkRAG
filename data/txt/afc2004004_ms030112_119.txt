MRS. DAVIS:
Well anyway I couldn't do anything about it so I just say Thank you Jesus and went on. But he meant well all the way.
LARRY:
Well after three years of knowing him and knowing you it just appeared to me one day that he tried to please everybody. And if it meant playing Blues or Ragtime numbers here and there he would like take a chance on doing it, just to please this person, and he was that kind of man.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, You know when you are in the music world they have a call for different things.
LIONEL:
How about those years in Bronx, sorry.
LARRY:
Speaking of the music world I never thought that. You know Mrs. Davis when you all living up there in the Bronx, Rev. Davis would sit around and I remember seeing him, he would sit alone and he would sit with his hands like that remember and I looked at the suit he had on that worn thin, worrying it seemed like to me from like I could tell he really wanted to do his music. Cause like one day I told him I say "Brother Davis it would take me so long to learn to play so good I was ya know looking at him and I say it would take me so long to learn I say I don't even know where it would be worth it or not and he laughed and he said well Larry look how long I been playing and he says I'm know where you know.
