MRS. DAVIS:
He knowed the Braille when I met him. The New York Braille he called them. But  there was a Braille he was going to learn, the latest kind of Braille is not New York its something else, and he got sent lots of books, a book came in for him yesterday. So Bertha told him, my next door neighbor did, said do you need to leave them books, he said Well I have
to leave it, I can't take them books back you tell Mrs. Davis that all she got to do is put return and return the books back with a letter. But I thought I'd give them to somebody that needs them, and Ted Smith another blind friend of ours, he called me yesterday, he says Mrs. Davis I
hate to tell you, Hows Brother Davis doing, he says I know I'm supposed to go out learning this new kind of braille, and so I said Teddy I'm sorry, he past away. He got so upset with me, he said Why in the world, you know Rev. Davis is my good friend why in the world didn't you let me know and I say Ted I didn't think, I tell you the truth, I didn't think of nobody's address. I couldn't think of anything and that's the truth, and some people in the Bronx they would have service, Johnson, She called
me up after she learned, I said like this to everybody. I think it was on two radios it was on -----Bartstos (?) it was on 10:30 in the day, about 10:30, 10:05. Five minutes past 10 until 1:30 and it was on here, and I said it was in the newspapers, It was in the New York Time and I said I thought everybody would have known about it, but you be surprised a lot of people don't listen to the radio, a lot of people don't read the paper, so, so many of my friends called me up Why didn't you let me know. That church wouldn't have hold all the people in, but I couldn't think of nobody
