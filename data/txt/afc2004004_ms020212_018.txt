Dear Mr. Koshland:

The copyright on "Johnny KooKoo" quoted in Miss Grau's 
novel is held by Hill and Ranch Music for the composer, 
Bessie Jones.

"Death, Spare Me for Another Year" is held by Lochrae 
Music, Inc. (c/o Mr. Paul Rosen, 39 West 55th Street, 
New York 19, New York).

You may quote me as saying that I approve of both of
 these quotations, permissions to be given without
 charge, as I am Bessie Jones' manager and agent.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax
