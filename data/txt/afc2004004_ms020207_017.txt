Reverend Roe.  Reel 8.  P. 4
[*Dancing is sinful because it tempts a man*]
if a man don't kinda lock up with a woman, he don't enjoy his dancing 
much, and over there in the Corinthians, [(   ?)] 1st Corin. 7th chapter, [end of]
 the first verse says it's good for a man not to touch a woman, and you 
know what that do.  Yeah.  [And] When you get to fooling around with a woman, 
[why] that [makes you] [ ? ] begin to rise, and it's not only in you but it's 
in her, too, and something wrong would take place.  So dancing is 
not the best thing.  Oh, if the men set out there and want to dance with one another, 
whythat and the women with one another might be (laughter), but you mix [the] those sex up together, it's not
