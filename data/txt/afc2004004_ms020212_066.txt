Dear Alan -

You must feel that we asked much, only
to forget quickly.  Actually, I haven't 
forgotten, but rather been haunted by
the plan to get a workprint + sound track
to you.  I'm afraid we're all in a slump
& just haven't pushed through the grim
editing job.  I say 'grim' because most 
scenes have two masters and ten retakes, 
and since the CU's require a different
sync (the psychological distance between 
viewer & screen often varies from the 
physical sound distance) from the LS's - 
wow! - I'm glad I'm not doing it.  But we 
may throw ourselves into the task next week.

The group saw the print, at least a big
chunk of it anyway, yesterday, & I'm sure
they were delighted.

The U.S. Information Agency wants it for
distribution in 46 countries.  This doesn't
pay too well, but in no way conflicts with 
educational or theatrical release.  The group 
may actually make something out of this
venture.  Will delay all commitments until
film finished & we can work these out together.
