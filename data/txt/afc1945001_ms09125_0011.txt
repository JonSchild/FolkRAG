  This is how a rumor began 
and ended and caused a 
lot of trouble for the government. 
  Mrs. Jones is hanging out 
her weekly wash when 
Mrs. Smith came out of 
her house and call to her 
to come to the fence. "Do 
you know what I heard" 
said Mrs. Smith. No what 
replyed Mrs. Jones, well 
Mrs. Smith began I don't
like to talk against the 
government but - Dolly 
just called and told me 
that we have pleanty of 
suger but we are just 
giving it all to our allies. 
And the people with high 
government jobs get extra 
suger. Well!  said Mrs. 
Jones I diden't think they 
would aloud all this. Can't 
something be don?
