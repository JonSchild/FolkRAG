Dear Alan :
What are your Christmas
plans? I'd like much to 
see you. Johnny and Shirley 
are coming here.
We leave here Sunday
morning early. Calloways,
Dobie for brushing popping calls,
San Antonio and Railroad Smith,
Frank Goodwyn & King Ranch.
Plaza Hotel, San Antonio, will 
be a good address unless
you wish to wire. More suggestions
 please. Sunday following 
our start we ought to be 
at Johnny's. Lovingly, Father.
