4.  University students were found to be just "talking" that the University     
    would "cut out" German next fall.
5.  A few women have been hysterical at parties when they received 
      small gifts marked "made in Japan".
6.  Rumors pertaining to rationing, and F.B.I. investigation of certain
       of our prominent citizens continue to circulate.
        (a) The newspapers have printed strong stories against these rumors,
              and a number of people appear to be concerned with this problem.

The Committee decided to:
  1.  Watch and report on the nature of this type of activity.
  2.  Discover, if possible, the source of these rumors, and the type of
        persons spreading them.  (This is, however, very hard to do.)

V.  The Committee decided that a more complete picture of the state of public opinion would be obtained by:
A.  Study of certain significant clubs.
     1.  Members accepted responsibility for "taking the pulse" of a number of
           clubs.  Each member accepted a specific assignment.
B.  Student of college student opinion.
       1. University members accepted this task.
VI.  No tension points have arisen, but this topic will be given more careful
attention in the future.
