Asa Ward - Greensnake.

Greensnake was one of the fastest mans in the world.  Been
everywhere and knowed everything and do everything.
               
It was a little boy come long, walking down the road one
day, you know, hongry and he didn't see nobody to ask for nothing
to eat, so he goes in this man's house and set down to the table
and go to eatin.   Greensnake's wife hears him in there and asks him,
"Son, what are you doin here?"  "Well, I'm only eatin."
                
She said, "My husband more than four thousand five hundred
miles away from home, but he'll kill you if he catch you here."
                
He said, "Lady, hide me somewhere, please."   She put him in the closet.
                
By the time she got him in the closet, this man hit the
house, say, "Old lady, where is that boy was here?"
                
"I got him in the closet."
               
"Bring him out and let me see him."
                
So she brought him out and let the man look at him and
he liked him pretty well.   He take him back to the table and let him
finish.   So after dinner he took him down to the new ground and learn
him how to work.
                 
The boy worked, I think, about six or seven months.  Greensnake 
began to like this kid and learned him some of his pranks
what he could do.  The boy got smart and decided to slip off from Greensnake.
He went home.
                
Where he lived, way out in Texas, there was a man coming along 
one day says to the boy's daddy, "Sam, bring your chicken down
to town tomorrow; we're gonna have a chicken fight."
