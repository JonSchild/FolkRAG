Once there was a sailor who
went to see his girl friend, and
take her out. But she didn't want
to go dancing because her feet
hurt, she didn't want to go to a
movie because she said she
needed glasses; so he asker her
did she want to go for a drive,
and she said, "yes"; but the sailor
said, "well you can't go cause I
Haven't any tires or gas."
