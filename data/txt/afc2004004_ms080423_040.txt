R6   Tape: APPALACHIA    p. 6

Man:   Well with the western dance you've got to go to school
and learn all the figures and they had a basic on western 
dancing when we first started.   We used to clog, and we 
quit clogging, and started western dancing.  It's so hard
to learn, why, I decided I'd try and you know it's really
hard.   You go through the figures in school and it's like
anything else.   And all the callers, they started--they
got, what, I guess nine, fifteen, two thousand, twenty-five
hundred different figures, and you have to go to school two
or three times a week to keep up with all the figures.
If you went to western dance to keep from breaking the square
down, there are lots of people in it that's retired and 
didn't have nothing left to do but to go to it.   And it
exhausts you to go.   We just decided it's too much.

I:   Clogging has got hundreds of different steps.

Man:   Well, yeah, but it's. .

Woman:   Everyone has their own steps.

I:   What are the names of the steps you know?

Man:   Well, uh, we do Georgies Ring Tie. . . .Old King's Highway,

I: Them's the formations, right?

Man:   Yeah, them's old hat.

I:   Don't you knock the back step and cut the double shovel?

Man:   Yeah, well, in our clogging, no two people on our team
dances alike.  You dance to the music, and keep the beat
to the music and you do your own step.

Woman:   You do your own thing, really.

Man:   Whatever you feel comfortable dancing, why, that's 
what you. .

I:   You invented your own steps.

Man:   That's right.   My steps, my father and uncle
and grandfather and I all get together on a Saturday night
just country people, and play the banjo, and fiddle, and
get up and dance all night long, the way they kept what
you call the 'bookback' (?).   Lots of people back in, I 
can remember when I was a little boy, used to do the Charleston.
Just shuffle your feet differnt from what do in (foot?)
dancing.

I:   Do you think they were better dancers in those days
or that dancing's got improved?
