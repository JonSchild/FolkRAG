RAILROADERS AND HOBOS

I don't like no railroad man,
Railroad man will kill you if he can,
I don't like no railroad man.

I don't like no railroad fool,
Railroad fool's got a head like a mule,
I don't like no railroad fool.

There's many a man been killed upon the railway,
And laid in his lonesome grave.

In the woods and the rivers of the North it was the Irishman who sang. In
the woods and rivers of the South it was the Negro who sang. And when the
railroads were to be built the work was done and the singing was done by 
Negros and Irishmen. However, the railroad is too big a thing for a human
voice, too big for anything but a symphony orchestra or a Tom Wolfe or a
little blind Negro boy from North Carolina who blows slow freights and fast
express passenger trains right out of his harmonica. His music
is too much for musical notation, because it is impossible to musical 
notation to tell the story of that home-wrecking, marrying, funeralising,
politicing, fructifying, terrorising, anarchistic, and order-loving devil-
wagon that roars and moans through the lonely black wastes of America.
