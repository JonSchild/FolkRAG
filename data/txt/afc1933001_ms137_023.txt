Sorry to be such trouble -- 
I am in funds now to the extent of 
$12.68 . This will last me about 
five days. If you think my [advance] reimbursements
will have reached me by that time, 
o.k., otherwise an advance might 
be in order. I am not wastreling - but songs 
in Mich. absolutely require beer. My address
for next three days will be St. Ignace
Mich. Will arrive there in a day or two. Regards
Alan
