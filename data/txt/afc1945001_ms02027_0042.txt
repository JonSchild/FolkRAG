            This was handled by Mr. William H. Book, executive 
vice-president of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce. 
Mr. Book, a former Indianapolis newspaperman, was also 
formerly State Welfare Director. He knows more about

any other person. He supplemented the rumors he heard 
with several from Mr. Mueller, who is a member of his 
staff.
