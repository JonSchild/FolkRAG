Cross Road Blues, Robert Johnson
Robert Johnson, Perfect 7-05-81 (SA 2629)

I went to the cross roads, fell down on my knees,
I went to the cross road, fell down on my knees,
Ast the Lord above, "Have mercy, now, save po' Bob if you please."


East at the cross roads, tried to flag a ride,
Ee--------, I tried to flag a ride,
Didn' nobody seem to know me, babe, everybody passed me by.

Standing' at the cross roads, baby, risin' sun  goin' down,
Standin' at the crossroads, baby, risin' sun goin' down,
I b'lieve to my soul now, po' Bob was sinkin' down.

You can run , you can run, tell my frien', Willie Brown,
That I got the cross roads blues, Lawd, this mornin, babe,
I'm sinkin' down.

I went to the cross roads, mama, I looked East and West,
I went to the cross roads, baby, I looked East and West,
I din' have no sweet woman, oo, well babe, in my distress.
