Dear Sir:

The question has arisen as to the origin, etc. of  the old 
number entitled "Oh, Didn't He Ramble". I believe that 
you are no doubt quite familiar with this, and I would 
greatly appreciate if you will write and advise me the 
full history of the selection so far as you know it, date 
of its origin, who wrote it, if this is known, was the 
original version ever published, and also a copy of the 
words.

We should be pleased to hear from you at an early date and, 
of course, if you are put to any expense in connection with 
procuring this data, we shall be glad to reimburse you for 
any nominal amount.

Very truly yours, 
H.C. Darrell
Manager of Copyright Section.

P.S.
We have addressed a similar letter to Mr. John 
A. Lomax, Lubbock, Texas, and he has suggested 
that we communicate with you regarding this 
matter.
