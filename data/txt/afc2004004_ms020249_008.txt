BOB-A NEEDLE
This song, from 'way back in olden times, is on other tapes,
sometimes under the titles of "Bobbin Needle," "Wade in the Green
Valley" and "Heavy, Heavy."  The players stand in a close ring
around a center player, who holds a knife, a pieve of wood, or
whatever represents the needle.  One of the ring players takes
the needle, then they pass it quickly around the ring singing:

Bob-a needle,)
Bob-a needle is a runnin',)  (3)
I'm gonna catch Bob-a-needle,
Bob-a needle is a runnin',
I'm gonna find Bob-a-needle,
Bob-a needle is a runnin',
Bob-a-needle, etc, etc.

Now the center player must guess who has the needle. The ring
players must not drop the needle or pass it on if they are
correctly guessed to have it.  Each player who is caught with
the needle must pay a pawn.  At any time, the players can stop
this part of the game, and then it is time for the pawns to be
payed.  [?] pawn is a sort of a fine and it may be hopping like a
frog, crowing like a rooster, barking like a dog, wading through
the green valley.

The one who is picked to wade through the green valley picks a
child of the opposite sex and stands a little distance from him.
Then the one who is paying the pawn askes the partner if he likes
various things (usually types of food).  If he likes it very
much, he takes a large step toward you: if a little bit, a small
step; if he is indifferent, he stands still; if he does not like
it he steps backwards.  This is kept up until the partner is right
up to the one who is paying the pawn, at which time the partner
may be kissed, hugged, etc.
