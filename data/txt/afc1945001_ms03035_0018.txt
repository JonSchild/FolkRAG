Dear Mr. Webber:

We regard as ineffectual the third effort in collecting unions.

The death of rumors, however, in places where they might reasonably
be expected may in itself be a good sign.

In [*??*] continuing such work, we find that it will be necessary to do a
considerable amount of additional educational work. Most of our
correspondents exhibit difficulty in distinguishing between rumor
and opinion. We have let these ride, nonetheless, to give you an
idea of how easily the average citizen falls into the error of 
confusing the two.

Strangely, one source proved wholly unproductive--the drug store.
This was curious since the drug store chosen is operated by Mrs.
Thomas Cogan, sister of the Mayor of Detroit, in an area near the
Ford Rouge plant, 301 Oakwood Boulevard, and pretty well sprinkled
with Italians and industrial workers. Mrs. Cogan herself is a
gossip and probably knows by name 70 per cent of the huge traffic
passing through her store. She sells liquor, is a bus and postal 
station.

Police Commissioner John Witherspoon assigned five higher than 
average patrolmen to pick up rumors on their beats in localities of
various character.

Best response from the beauty parlors. Charles of the Ritz (Comer
Syprett, manager) is with a local store, Himelhoch Company, Detroit,
which has a rather exclusive personnel. A second beauty shop
operated by Bert M. Grim, which employs 10 girls at 308 West Grand
Blvd., Detroit, also co-operated. In neither case did all employes
cooperate. In each, certain people more skilled than others were
selected.
