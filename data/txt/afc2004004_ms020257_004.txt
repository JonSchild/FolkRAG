BJ TAPE 43, p. 2

was born out there.  Somebody musta put the peoples on to it
someway or other.  But they went out there, an' that woman had to
take that baby an' put 'im in the barn?  You know, [they put 'im,] the crib?
The colored woman did?  They put the baby in the crib an' so, so
they tryin' to catch the man that was, he was goin' back an'
forth.  Laura, the baby done born, Laura was in town.  See, Laura
had been gone about 2 months, see?  But she was out there, the
whole time, you know.  So when they come to fin' out, some of
'em went out there.  They, they gonna fin' that baby.  Somebody
blabbed it somewhere, out there.
An' so, an' um, um, Jesse Lloyd
an' Thomas Lloyd, the other lil' boy -- the other'n was a young
boy -- but all them brothers a hers, they, she had 3 brothers,
an' ol' Man Lloyd, he was up for it, too, so I heard.  But those
boys the one that got, ah, dat man away from there.  And the
baby.  Got 'im away from there; I don't know how far they got
'im up, but they got 'im up until he come up this country.  An' they
sent 'im, they sent 'im to some a their peoples up, up the country,
somewhere.  I don' know wheth' it wa New Yawk or what part a
the North.  But they are saved.
An', an' ah, an', so, an' dis woman what had the chil' out
there, ya know, was related to him somehow.  Wa-wasn' his mother,
but she related to him, somehow.  An' ah, an' reason why we know
they saved, because we have seen the baby's picture
since then an' heard 'er talk about it, how well they gittin'
along, since then.
I heard her own brothers saved him.  'Cause they was down
together.  They'd be with the colored womens, white womens,
anything, all about them ol' spo'tin' places an' woods an'
things ya know?  All around, (card?) houses an' things together.
