say that "they are getting ahead.
They have been making such a
fine showing. They'll have the
run of things." Or - in the city,
heard another remark "If they
want a second front, why don't 
they go themselves." And someone
else in the city said," If we
don't have a second front 
right away, it'll be much
harder on Americans later - more
soldiers will be killed."

I do not believe the above
statements would come within the 
purview of the meaning of "rumor,"
and therefore have no report
to make. I guess the people
I've met or heard talk are
behind the war efforts of the
President. I do not know of
course whether my not hearing
rumors is a good or bad index
of the reactions of people to the
war. Perhaps the saying, "No 
news is good news" applies to
this report.

Respectfully,
