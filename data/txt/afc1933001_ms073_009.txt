Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Thank you for your candid
letter and for a copy of the authorization.
I have also received notice that
the machine has shipped from
Colorado. Unless my "affliction" grows
much more serious I think I'll be
on the road very soon after September
1. I'll be writing you.

We leave here for Dallas by
the time this letter reaches you. Our
yard man, Mike, takes care of all my 
affairs while we are away from
Dallas, so the machine has been looked
after. I'll be mighty glad to see
you again. Yours always,
John A. Lomax
