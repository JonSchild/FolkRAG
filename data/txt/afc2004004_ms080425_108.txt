     Do you play a lot of Sacred Harp tunes?
     Yes, I like to play Sacred Harp. I'll play. . . . .
if you want me to. (plays) No, I don't have a favorite, I love every one

a better bass voice after I was a little older, you know, 18 or 19 years
old. But now I sing whichever part is necessary for me to sing. I sung
new-book when I was a kid, you know, I started out with new-book.
      Tell us about your growin' up. You started singin' bass when you were

     I don't know if I started singin' bass at five, but I started singin'
