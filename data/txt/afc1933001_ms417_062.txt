I Hate the Capitalist System
bastardly mess --- the whole crazy system --- starvation on one hand and rape and whores and weaklings and sissies and drunkards, and pimps and sex-perverts on the other --- and waste and filth and rotten crops and rotten people, and whole packages of money --- to toss back and forth across a gambling table in Reno, Monte Carlo, Mexico City, Tia Juana, Mexicalla, ....Paris, and New York City ..... while we go ragged and hungry and straved.
American belongs to everybody in it. It is more than a gambling wheel, more than a gambling game, more than a night spent with a whore, or a week end spent with a mistress, or a divorce in Reno, and a hot June bride in a feather bed ...... America belongs to us that work in it ... not to you guys that rob in it ... and the day and time will come when you'll see that your rotten filthy, low down ways ----- and all of your armies, soldiers, cops, deputies, and national guards --- will be won over with a 'song' -- and that song is in this book.
