Washington, D.C..
December 6, 1942.

Dear Jim,

I want to tell you that this book we have been discussing
is potentially the most wonderful and most exciting book that I have
ever been connected with. Here is an outline of it, a sort of table
of contents with a running descriptive commentary.

Introduction: On December ninth , 1941 we were listening
to the radio in the recording room." Three thousand soldiers believed
killed at Pearl Harbor, etc.." all by courtesy of Tums Stomach Easer.
The president was about to come over the wire from the Capitol. The
needle of the recording machine was set on the disc to record him.
"what can we do," we kept saying,"What can we here in the Recording
Laboratory of the Library of Congress do to make a meaningful contribution 
[to the present crisis?"] in the present emergency?"

I// What we did was to send telegrams to [twelve] field workers
in various parts of the country asking them to document in recorded
form the opinions of the American people about the Japanese attack
and the declaration of war by the President. What they sent us from
Nashville, Texas, Denver, Bloomington, Madison, New York, Boston,
North Carolina, and what we recorded ourselves here in Washington is
the most magnificent expression of spontaneous unity, understanding,
and will to [it] win that any people ever gave. (SEE QUOTES LABELED"I")
We put the material together in a fifteen minute transcribed broadcast ,
the first documentary broadcast ever to be sent over a radio station
in the United States.

II. Various people in agencies over Washington were so much excited
about the potentialities of this new kind of broadcast that the
Office of Emergency Management has commissioned us to get together
the material for a documentary broadcast to be called "Dear Mr.
President," in which the people will talk directly to the President,
tell him about their problems, [taalk] explain to him what they are doing
and what they want to do in this present emergency. The raw material
for and the story of this broadcast will be the subject of the second
chapter.

III. America in the Summer of 1941. During that summer we sent our
sound truck into the hinterland of the United States to ducument the
life of the people, their opinions and their problems. We documented
an Okie Folk Festival, the Negro Revival season in Texas, a defense boom-town , 
the Tennessee Valley experiment and so on.
A.) The [far] first chapter of this section will be the story of
what we recorded at Asheville. The Asheville Folk festival with its songs,
fiddling contests, its folk tales and interviews with the singers backstage.
An interview with Thomas Wolfee's mother in whose home we stayed. A
revival service at a local white church with a sermon on Dives and Lazarus. 
A day [with] at the home of one of the most important and successful
hill-billy singers of our time.
B) We then went to Union County,Georgia , until recently one of the
most isolated and backward counties of the South. There we documented the
