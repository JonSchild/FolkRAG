Friday following

   Written in bed on the 4th
floor of the Hotel Tholog√©.  For
the last two days I have been
as ill as ever in my life.  Very
high fever.  A doctor with the face
of a stupid pig prescribed aureomycin.  
By tomorrow I'll know 
whether the glands, so swollen in my
throat, are caused by [that] grippe or
by something more unpleasant.

    Actually the cause is the same as
my illness last year - the special
loneliness induced by Paris.  Whenever
I permit myself, my thoughts turn
to Elizabeth & Anne & I have to
fight back tears.  Really I am not
permitting myself to feel how painful
their departure [is] was.  Another
