   The Sergeant began to show Tom around the camp and showed him people who used to be just like Tom. The sergeant then took Tom to the Chapel and said "This boy never wrote to his mother and now he has no mother to write to. Now he is praying to God and asking him to forgive him for the way he treated her. Now you just remember this boy and take a lesson from him.
   The next week after that Tom wrote three very long letters home, and he now writes home every day. Tom is now serving over seas as a First Lieutenant, and will always remember what his top Sergeant did for him.
