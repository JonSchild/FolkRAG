[Round Dance
1) O Hattie, I want to go home
(grind
For I belong (going) to Eleultra land
(I'm going.
For I'm tired of livin' down here,
Say goodbye, Mary,
I'm going to leave you,
For I goin' to Eleul for land
If you didn' listen to your mother
So, You [was] will be my hopes to get married
If you did be for a single boy,
But fare you well girl
You not in hopes to get married.]
