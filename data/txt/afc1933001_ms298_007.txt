shook his head sadly, and said that he couldn't carry a [tu]
tune. Experience has taught me to know that people who
say that they can't carry a tune are wonderful folk  song
informants. This young man was certainly no exception,
for presently he began to sing and sang pretty much all
the wayfrom Georgia to the Potomac River.
        The young lady to whom I dictated this speech
not more than a week ago and whom one wouldn't suspect
of more than a mild social interest in Glen Miller or
Kay Kayser's latest number gave the names and addresses 
of ten or fifteen people in her home state who could give 
me songs. She added that her grandmother could sing
most of the songs in my ballad book. 
        The last taxi driver that took me home told
me that his father was considered one of the best five
string banjo pickers in Alabama and that if I really
wanted to get some songs I should go to him--one of the
negro laborers at the Library of Congress and I had 
been looking at each other with interest and suspicion for
some weeks before we finally had a chat. In that chat it
developed that he had spent nine years on the extra gang
of the L and N railroad and knew all the work songs I
could mention and a lot more beside. All this make a 
collector pretty humble andbesides makes him feel that
no matter how hard he and several hundred others may work
we'll never get to the bottom of this matter of folk song.
.....This has been a long summary, perhaps a tedious one
