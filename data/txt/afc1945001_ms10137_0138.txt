Sophomore
Male Negro

1) A man who was called to the army
was getting fixed up with his uniform.
Everything was too big for him so
he went to the Sergeant and told him
about it.  He said, "Sergeant why are
all of my clothes to be big especially the 
shoes.  The sergeant said, "Brother after
you take that 50 mile hike, you
[th] will wish they are bigger.

2) A private while on K.P. said, "Why
do they put me in the kitchen peeling
potatoes when I can be on the
battle field help peeling to Japs.  
Sergeant: Practice makes perfect."

3) Sergeant, How do you feel this morning
private after you nights sleep on
the bunks.
Private, I feel all right because I got
up a couple of hours to rest.
