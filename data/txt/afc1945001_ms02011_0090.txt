Information and Anti-Rumor Activity

It is clear that rumors always arise during periods of
tension. Rumors always spread during wartime, because people are
under emotional strain. The public tensions and uneasiness which
are inevitable during war can best be cased by a continuous flow
of news about the war. The antidote to most rumors is information--
clear, complete, honest news.

but even the most complete and accurate information about
the war, with its multitude of details, cannot prevent rumors from
springing up. For war increases feelings of anxiety. War sharpens
public interest, and focuses public attention upon problems
about which full information cannot always be given promptly, or
upon situations so complex that even the publication of the known
facts does not always provide simple and reassuring explanations.
War therefore fosters those conditions in which rumors flourish.

The analysis of rumors is most valuable in revealing
those areas of information in which public ignorance or confusion
leads to rumors. Rumors can be converted to positive value if
they are studied as a guide to information gaps which need to be
filled--not by rumor-denials but by intensive information programs.
