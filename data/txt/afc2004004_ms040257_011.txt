REEL 30:      PIPE-MAJOR ROSS, EDINBURGH

I began to play - learn - when I was about seven
and, of course, my father and mother played the pipes
and it was much easier for me then because they were
both of the same opinion as regards styles and one
thing and another and it was easy for me to be taught
by both. I used to play even when I was out on the 
hill with my father - shooting - we would sit down
and play a tune over by word or mouth then.
Mouth music.
LOMAX:  What does that sound like?
ROSS:  Hi hodo ra hehen
            HI  "        "     "
That's two bars of a ground of a pibroch. That is
how it was taught, you see.
So then I began to grow up and took part in my first
competition at the games - Struy Games - and I was
awarded the first prize for marches, you see.
And then I saw there was no way of making a living
and I thought I would join the Army. I was very
fond of soldiering, and I joined the Scots Guards
at the age of 17 and, of course, I was the height - 
even then I was five feet ten and a half inches when
I was 17 years of age, so I had no difficulty in getting
in.
LOMAX:  Piping goes back to the MacCrimmons.
ROSS:  My uncle was taught by people who were taught by people
. . . by the MacCrimmons.
LOMAX:  The MacCrimmons - they had piping from the first. . .
ROSS:  They were prime pipers and the MacKays of Gairloch too.
LOMAX:  And these tunes go back to the beginning.
ROSS:  They are very very old.
This pibroch - there is ony one uniform style of these
pibrochs, you know.    . . . That goes back to the very 
early/
