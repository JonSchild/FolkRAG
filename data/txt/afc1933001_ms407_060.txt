I decided to walk from Silver
City to Deming sixty miles
away and to stop for the
night [at] with friends at the
old Hearst Ranch, the famous
Diamond A headquarters. My
recording machine I sent
ahead by express.  I needed
exercise and I loved the
solitude among the scattered
peaks, outcroppings of the
Rocky Mountains.

One afternoon when 
I was far away from the
little travelled highway, I came
suddenly on a small house
on wheels, a span of burros
cropping the scant grass near by.
