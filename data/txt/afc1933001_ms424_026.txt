MASSA DEAR
(Negro)

(Page 128 - Laurel Song Book)


Massa dear, massa dear, O look down a-while!
Winds am still, heav'n am clear, you can hear dis chile,
All the home folks is gone, and I'm lonesome here
Work is o'er, day is done, take me, massa dear,
Take me home, for Delight went away with you
Call me home from the night, As you used to do,
As you used to do, as you used to do.


OLD BLACK JOE
(Negro)

(Page 242 - Old Favorite Songs)

Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay!
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away
Gone from the earth to a better land I know,
I hear their gentle voices calling, "Old Black Joe."

Chorus: I'm coming, I'm coming,
For my head is bending low:
I hear their gentle voices calling, "Old Black Joe!"


SWING LOW SWEET CHARIOT
(Negro)

(Page 48) - Twice 55 Songs - Brown
Book, C.C.Birchard - Boston - )


Swing low sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home,
Swing low sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home,
A band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.
