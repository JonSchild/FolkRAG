1. In many cases the same workers will be employed
in collecting material for both Guides, especially
where the folklore supervisor shows a distinct
grasp of social-ethnic problems, and vice versa.
2. In any case the supervisor should acquaint himself
thoroughly with the methods and materials of
both the folklore and the social-ethnic studies in
his locality (including the instructions and the
special outlines) in order to view a particular
body of lore in its whole social and cultural
setting as well as to understand the folk backgrounds
of culture.
3. In cases where the folklore of the immigrant
group is a distinct variant from Old World forms
or an American variation, a full coverage of the
lore is desirable, with comparison between Old
World and New World forms.
4. In making collections of folklore for the social
ethnic-studies, the instructions for The American
Folklore Guide should be followed.
5. Workers on both guides will exchange information
as to sources and informants.

All correspondence concerning folklore should be marked
for the attention of Dr. B. A. Botkin, Subject: Folklore.
