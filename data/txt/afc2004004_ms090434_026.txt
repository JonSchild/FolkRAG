More Metal And
Rubber Needed
From Mississippi
JACKSON, Miss., July 24.--
County agents, county AAA
committeemen, county administrative
officers, and members of
the county boards of supervisors
Thursday heard state AAA officials
and state salvage committee
executives plead "for the
same kind of fighting spirit on
the farm that prompts young
men to volunteer for service that
characteried American heroes
in Bataan."
Leland Speed, chairman, and
Russell Ellzey, executive secretary
of the State Salvage Committee,
outlined the national
scrap harvest campaign to collect
50,000 tons of scrap metal
Dec. 31.  The campaign will be
directed by the state, county and
city salvage committees.
Mr. Ellzey asked the county
leaders to call meetings of the
county salvage committees, supintendents
of education, boards
of supervisors, service station
operators, farm machinery dealers,
automobile dealers and representative
business dealers and
representtive business men, to
work out details of the campaign.
Leon Pace, Canton, vice president
of the Mississippi Supervisors'
Association, told how
supervisors were co-operating
by providing county-owned
trucks for hauling scrap.
Ed Gatlin, state director of
WPA, told how his organization
was operating 302 trucks from
farm to farm and which had
collected more than 30 million
pounds of scrap metal and two
million pounds of scrap rubber.
He said the WPA needed 104
more trucks in order to place
one in every supervisor's district
in the state.

KNOW YOUR NEIGHBOR--
The writer knows from experience that you get
acquainted with folks lots faster by walking than
you do by riding.  In the past three months, while
walking from my home to my office I have been given
a ride in the cars of many people, some of whom I
knew only by sight, and others I did not know at all.
Many delightful acquaintances have been formed.
We feel we are in a position to say, "If you want
to broaden your acquaintance, try swapping rides
with your neighbors."
There is another side to this matter, that of conservation
of tires.  Every day from now on, passenger
automobiles will be dropping out of service because
of lack of tires.  Our experience has suggested
to us the idea that a "Know Your Neighbor" Club
should be organized.
If you live a distance from town, which makes
walking impossible, it may be that you could arrange
