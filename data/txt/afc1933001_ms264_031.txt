Hell Hound on My Trail
I got to keep movin',
I got to keep movin',
Blues fallin' down like hail,
Blues fallin' down like hail,
Um ------,
Blues fallin' down like hail,
Blues fallin' down like hail;
An' if they keeps on worryin' me,
It's a hell hound on my trail,
Hell hound on my trail,
Hell hound on my trail.
It today was Christmas day,
If today was Christmas day,
An' tomorrow was Christmas day,
If today was Christmas day,
An' tomorrow was Christmas day,
Aw, wouldn't we have a time, babe?
Lawd, I wouldn't need my little sweet rider
Just to pass the time away.
You sprinkled them hot foot powdo,
Um--around my do',
All around my do'.
Yo sprinkled hot foot powdo
All 'round yo' daddy's do',
Um-hum,
It keep me with a ramblin' min', rider,
Every old place I go,
Every old place I go.
I can tell the wind is risin'
The leaves tremblin' on the trees,
Tremblin' on the trees.
I can tell the wind is risin'
The leaves termblin' on the trees,
Tremblin' on the trees.
All I need is my little sweet woman
to keep my company,
My company.
