NOAH: GOD'S COVENANT WITH MANKIND
-
LESSON TEXT - Genesis 9:1-16
GOLDEN TEXT - I will remember my covenant - Genesis 9:15.
- 
God does not forget.  He keeps His promises now just as He did in the days of Noah.  Since our lesson of last Sunday, a long period of time had elapsed.  Generation after generation had come and gone, and all the while man grew more and more wicked.  Finally, God saw that He must put an end to the corruption of the human race, saving just one righteous family, that of Noah, with which to begin anew.

He warned Noah of the judgment of the flood, and he in turn doubtless warned others, but finally the day came when God shut him in the ark and poured forth the waters of judgment upon the then inhabited earth.  But the same God who shut Noah in (Gen. 7:1), in due time called him out (Gen. 8:15, 16).

Noah had obeyed God, and He now rewarded him.  The man who had borne the ridicule was now honored by Him.  The experience of Noah brings before us--

God's Three Gifts to a Believing Man:

I. Power (vv. 1-4).
Man is the "lord of creation," not because he has brought about its subjection, but because God gave him that power.  It was first given to Adam (Gen. 1:26), and it is renewed here, with the additional promise of the animal as food.  This was not to be, however, after the manner of wild beasts (v. 4).

No man ever lost anything by obeying the commands of God, even though appearances may seem to so indicate.  The ridicule of those who called Noah foolish for obeying God, had now been silenced by the judgment of the flood, and he stood forth vindicated, empowered by God, with authority over the whole earth.

Faith is still the victory.  Men who put their hopes in the kings empires of this earth have seen and wane," and even un- beginning to talk about

ABRAM: A PIONEER IN FAITH
-
LESSON TEXT - Genesis 12:1-9; Hebrews 11:8-12
GOLDEN TEXT - Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. - Genesis 15:1.
-
Without faith it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11:6).  The opposite is also true, namely, that faith always pleases God.  AS we read the Bible and consider Christian experience, it is evident that God is constantly longing to show Himself strong in behalf of them who believe Him (II Chron. 16:9).

Abraham was not the first man to walk by faith.  Before him came such men as Abel, with his acceptable sacrifice; Enoch, with his walk pleasing to God; Noah, who believed and obeyed; and others.

But Abraham was nonetheless a pinoeer of faith.  He had many other noble characteristics, and was a man of such distinction that his memory is venerated by Jews and Mohammedans as well as Christians.  Yet his real claim to an outstanding place in history is that by faith he responded to God's sovereign act in choosing him to begin a new nation, to be His chosen people.

We note two important points about faith:

I.  Faith Make Demands.
In the very nature of things, faith calls for action consistent with belief.  "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:20), that is, not a real faith at all.  In Abraham's life (and in our life) faith calls for

1. Separation (Gen. 12:1).
"Get thee out" was God's command to Abraham.  To accomplish His divine purpose God had to take him out of the heathendom of this fathers, and start anew.  It is His command to His followers today, "Come out from among them, and be ye separated, saith the Lord."

Who will doubt that this is the crying need of the church today, for instead of the church being in the world seeking to win it to Christ, worldliness has come into the church and devitalized its message.

2.  Obedience (Gen. 12:4-6; Heb. 11: 8, 9).


The Writing of Mattie Dear
BOX 105 - Alligator, Miss.

Well I hardly know what to say but I will say that I am glad that I am on this side of the grave and that's a wonderfull blessing.  I am now back from Rosedale hospitle, glad of it.

Now I went to the St. Jame's A. M. E. Church Sunday, they seem to have a very good Sunday school turning out about 1 o'clock.  Heard a wonderful sermon, Rev. L. F. Paterfield then I come on over to the Pleasant Valley M. B. Church where they was having a combined meeting Sunday School and mission.

Rev. Griffin preached a heart felt sermon, then Rev. Knights and Rev. Griffin raised the sum of $2.70 for the Sunday school.  Rev. Price preached for the mission sister's taken for his text a part of the 7 ch. of St. John and 17. v. subj. for this cause I come into the world.

Rev. Price is nothing but a boy but he is sure preaching and I am glad to see him; so many boys his age is lying around in different places where they have no business, but he taken a stand for Christ.

Rev. Steverson, pastor of the Azion Church preached a soul stirring serson oh how our hearts did burn whilse he talk with us by the way side, text found in 2nd Timothy, subj the necessary of knowing God's word it looks like.

More preaching we hear won't the people's are getting but by and by they are going to wish they had taken heed, I gets to myself and wonders what's going to become of the wild sinfull people and seems like they love it.

Do you know it is prayer time God said men out to always pray and not faint.  He means that another thought Mattie Dear will bring to you about rations, you may rations all you want.

Without prayer it profit nothing we should and ought to serve God with our soul, might and strengthy and He sure will ans us if any failure it will be in us I remember when I was a child my mother and other old women would meet together and talk about Christ and His goodness and would have a shout in the camp but now they gets and talk about one an- don't mind before
