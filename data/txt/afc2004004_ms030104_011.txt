Your circumstance is bad
PREACH. PREACH.
But that's not Hell (nono)
Conditions and circumstances
Are exponents of hell
LAUGHTER.     PREACH.
But it's not Hell
Hell's a long way down the road 
From the stop of conditions and circumstances
HELL ISN'T LIKE THAT.     YEAH.
Conditions and circumstances [are just stops] where ---
The Hellish people get on board the Hell-bound train
WELL. ALRIGHT. PREACH. JUS' PREACH NOW. (long pause)
You know - you know some would believe that Hell is just an external state
It's without.      
Somewhere out yonder, When you get tired of it 
You can pick it up and move it.
MY LORD
And when you get tired of there
You can pick it up an' move it again
But Hell is a place
ALRIGHT.
Just like Heaven is a place
Hellll-ll is a place.
WELL.
Just like Heaven is up
Hell's down
WELL
Just like God reigns above
The Devil reigns beneath
THAT'S RIGHT. [64    [long 1 1/2]]
