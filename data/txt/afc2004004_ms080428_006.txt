instrument of the frountierman [sic] but
the fiddle only came into general

migration, but a lot of the people
who came from Britian [sic] didn't have a 
fiddle and it was slow and becoming 
common in the real frountier [sic] because
the pioneers couldn't make fiddles.
They could make mouth bows and 
banjos when they learnt that from
the blacks, but they couldn't make
fiddles so they will remember with               [*Fiddle ecstatic delight*]
absolute ecstatic delight the first
time they ever heard a fiddle sound.

hand and . . .

He took her by her lilly [sic] white hand,      [*Fiddle*]
And light her like a pigeon,
