Dear Alan Lomax:

    Immediately upon receipt of your wire, we sent a telegraph
order to Presto for the parts.

    The Librarian is back but I have had no opportunity to discuss 
the Archive with him yet. I'm glad of it, though, because
I've had no word from you yet. Please write once a week if
possible. I should like to have some report to make when he asks
me about you.

    Good luck! Regards.
    Sincerely,

    Acting-Chief,
    Division of Music
