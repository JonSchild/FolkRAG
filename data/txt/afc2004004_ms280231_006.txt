False Lover: Isla Cameron. 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . maid, 
He said to her, "Won't you come along with me, 
And sit with me awhile?" 

2) "Oh no, kind sir," she answered him, 
"No, kind sir, I'm too young." 
"The younger you be the better 'tis for me, 
For I want a wife and a son." 

3) He took her by the lily-white hand 
He kissed her cheek to chin, 
He took her to his own bedroom 
And there the trouble began. 

4) In the middle of the night when the moon shone bright 
The moon shone bright and clear, 
The young man roxe, put on his clothes, 
Saying, "Fare-thee-well, my dear." 

5) "O that's not the promise you made to me 
When you lay upon my breast. 
You made me believe with your false and lying tongue 
That the sun rose in the west." 

6) Now other farmer's daughters 
To market they can go, 
While I must sit by my own fireside 
and rock the cradle-o. 

7) There's many a star shines in the East, 
There's many a leaf below, 
There's many a damn that will fall upon a man 
That treats a poor girl so. 

8) There's a herb that grows in my father's garden, 
Some they call it rue, 
The fish may swim and the birds may fly 
But a man can never be true.
