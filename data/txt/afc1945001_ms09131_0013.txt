1. The myth (or is it?) that [Schicklegarder?] has a 
large number of men under him who look
just like him so that in the event of his
death or disappearance the next model in line
could step up & fill his post.

2. Third party in America for 1944
Candidate: Eleanor Roosevelt.

3. A plane filled with many passengers of all
different nations was having trouble getting
over a high mountain. There was a Pole,
a Finn, a Frenchman, an Italian, a
Greek, and an Englishman in it. They
decided one of them would have to make the
supreme sacrifice & jump out to lighten the
weight of the load.
The Pole went to the door yelled, "Long
live Poland!" & jumped out. That wasn't 
enough so the Finn followed suit. Soon
the Frenchman fell out crying "Vive la
France!" Everything went smoothly but the
plane was losing altitude again.
