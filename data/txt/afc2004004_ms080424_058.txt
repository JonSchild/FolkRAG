Time Code:
Tape:  Ray and Stan Hicks Roll 51    7
(Stan) old man caught him out, and he told him "Now you take her or you
die!  That's all there is to it!"  So the boy he tried to slip out after
night and get away, he was probably goin' to another girl.  And they had
a gristmill, and this boy went to his daddy's gristmill and he started to
run it you know.  Til this other man that was aimin' to kill him, thought
he was in the gristmill a grindin'.  He didn't want to kill him while he
was grinding, he'd wait til he come out.  So he watched the mill all night.
He got tired of listenin' to it, and so he went in there to kill him, and
the mill was just a runnin' and nobody in it.  He done gone again so they
didn't get him.
Techn:  Can you guys just talk back and forth between yourselves for a minute?
Stan:  How you been. . .?
Ray:  Oh, just walkin' around here, can't do much no more.
Stan:  You don't gather no herbs or nothin'?
Ray:  No, I ain't tried none this summer.  I tried a few last summer, with
hazel bark, and my leg and arms just wouldn't take it, I had to quit.
All I done this time is raise that little corn patch there and that little
bean patch and just hope the boy staggered along just took about 4 or 5
bushels (unint.)
Stan:  Well I noticed yesterday when I was sitting on the porch, I saw you
settin' out some sassfrass bark, saw you peelin'
Ray:  Yeah, Ted picked that, my boy did.
Stan:  Well, you used to make tea out of that.
Ray:  Yeah, some do that.  He picked 'em to sell it to 'em directly.
Stan:  How much is it payin' now, you knows?
Ray:  Well, they outlawed it on the market, it's just a few people. . .I think
he sellls it for about $1/pound.  (technical. . . . .)
