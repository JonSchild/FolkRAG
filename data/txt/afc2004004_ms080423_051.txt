much like work.

Woman 3:   We like to do our own thing.

Woman 4:   We're too conscious of it to really enjoy it, it's

AL:   I think one of you ladies has brought along something
to show us, haven't you.

Woman:   Something I'm real proud of.   This quilt represents
our team.   We make our dresses and I saved the scraps
and I've got this pattern, two little dancers and I used
the scraps and fixed 'em as near like our uniforms as I
could possibly do.   And you can look at 'em and right off
identify the one that it is because it's just like.   It
took me a long time to do this and I'm real proud of it.

AL:   How long did it take you?

Woman:   Well, about a year to piece it together, because
I had to get the little dancers right down, and I had to
cut out all of the dresses and you see all these little
ruffles and everything.   And some places, you'll notice,
instead of little buttons I put little french knots. . .

Man:   When the sun gets in my eyes, I got to drop them down.
When I get in a breeze I kick 'em up. . . .When Jake was explaining
something else. .(?). . he wasn't telling you the truth(?).
