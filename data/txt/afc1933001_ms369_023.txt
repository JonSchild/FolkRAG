F77  Prolegomena to the Ballads

Present peasant stock the same [two] for a thousand years, [?] tradition
unmixed & unconquered by mixing of stock - uneducated until 50
yrs ago, never moving out of 5 mile circle - singing and dancing for heart
pleasure, so if were outstripped dancing it was because tongue more flexible
than feet - [?]
(the racial mixtures of Britain are obvious to
any one who examines the evidence of physical
anthropology.)

Ballad singing or corruption not dead. 
Scotch                       &   Eng. ballads compared.
Fierce, strongwilled,     Jolly, mawkishly sentimental
wild, bloodthirstly,
succinct, good at 
supernaturalism &
arousing pity in
a brief line
