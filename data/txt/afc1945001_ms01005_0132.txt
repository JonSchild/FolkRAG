October 10, 1942
Dear Mr. Gilbert:
Your recent letter to Mr. Elmer Davis has been referred to my office
for investigation and reply.
Unfortunately, a lack of detail in the story as you reported it makes
it almost impossible to get an accurate statement concerning its possible
truth or falsity.  It may interest you to know that quite a number of such 
stories have come to the attention of members of this office, sometimes referred
to the Navy, sometimes to the Army.  In each case, the content is very
vague and names and places were forgotten.
The frequency with which this type of story pops up makes you feel
that it should be considered in the rumor category.  This sort of story can 
scarcely be destroyed without recognizing that it reflects a certain amount
of anxiety about the possibilities of death and hostility toward the administration
of our armed forces.  You are completely correct that this is "the 
kind of stuff our enemies circulate" and I would suggest that it might be
more effective to make that point rather than to question  the truth or falsity
of the story.
A person sincerely back of our war effort, would stop this story by
refusing to spread it and pointing out to others that spreading it is likely
to cause anxiety on the part of parents of men in the Navy; it might prevent
others from permitting their sons to go into the Navy; it promotes lack of
confidence in our leaders.  In this way it might just as well be Axis propaganda
even though loyal Americans are spreading it.
Thank you very much for you concern in this matter.  I trust that 
this letter will help your situation.
Sincerely yours,
R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
