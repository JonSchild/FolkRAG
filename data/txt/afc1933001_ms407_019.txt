2
north section of the rich Delta
lands of the Mississippi river
where the land is as level as the
Texas Panhandle and as fertile
as the Nile Night fall before
our journey ended. We had come
to where in the darkness [?]
we could see large bright [?] spots
of light breaking through the
blackness. Afterwards we found
that each patch of light marked
a group of buildings housing 2 or
3 hundred convicts. A ring of
white arc lights surrounds each
group of buildings. The lights burn
the night through. Over across the
Mississippi river and further
down in Louisiana the convicts
have a song beginning
"Angola, Angola, where the lights
burn all night long."
