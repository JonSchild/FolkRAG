HOW BALLADS GROW 

Ballad of the Erie Canal 

Many years ago while I was on a folk-song lecture trip among the 
colleges of the United States, I spent one night in the home of Professor 
E. E. Hale, a member of the English faculty of Union College at Schenectady, 
New York, whose father wrote the classic short story, The Man Without 
a Country. My host, himself a folk-song lover, gave me one stanza 
of a ballad which he said was popular among the boatmen and mule drivers 
one the Erie Canal. Later a ranchman from Montana sent me another stanza 
of the same song. Some time afterwards I found a third stanza at a ranch 
on the Rio Grande River in Texas. Some years later W. D. Tatten, a lawyer
in Seattle, Washington, sent to me three additional stanzas, the refrain,
and also the music of the song which he had learned while working as a 
tow-path boy on the Erie Canal during the years from 1871 to 1877. Again
Dr. J. V. Denny, a professor of English in the University of Ohio, added
another stanza. Yet another came from Chicago. One wondered in from
Montana. Finally in the library of Allegheny College at Meadville,
Pennsylvania, I found still another. Walter D. Edmonds, needing another
stanza for one of his stories, made one up on the spot and got away with it.

This group of stanzas I put together without changes as one song, 
Ballad of the Erie Canal, in the form of a continuous narrative. Perhaps
these words were never sung together, and time and travel have certainly
brought changes in the original composition and music. Doubtless the
original song was the result of growth, no one person being its author.
