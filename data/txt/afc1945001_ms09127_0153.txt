About the War.

Two of my favorite jokes which 
I have heard about the war are 
as follows.

Two American soldiers were sitting
in there tent at camp when all 
of a sudden they heard a loud 
noise.
First soldier asks; was that bombs
or thunder.
Other soldier; It was bombs!
First soldier: Oh thats good, I
thought sure we were going to have
more rain.  HA! HA!

A Navy man goes up to a soldier 
and say's: Did you hear about the
United States dividing the ocean with
Japan.
Soldier answers: No, how are they
going to do it.
Sailor: Oh! We're going to take the
top, and give them the bottom.  HA! HA!
it's 
killin 
me
