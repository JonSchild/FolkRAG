Dear Dr. Umble:

Unless my plans change, I will not be able to attend
the American Folk Lore meeting in New York this Christmas.
I believe, however, that it will be possible to send you
a duplicate record of two of the Amish hymns for demonstration
purposes. This request of yours will have to be approved
by the Librarian and for that reason I cannot make
a definite promise at the moment. In the meantime, however,
you can choose from the enclosed list which of the hymns
you prefer to have duplicated in case this recommendation
is approved.

I should appreciate an early reply to this inquiry.

Cordially yours,


Assistant in Charge
