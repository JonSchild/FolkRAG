BJ TAPE 17, p. 37

time I ever heard, she had six children she said, an' had married a man
from Nebraska.  Now, Uncle John, I may (?) could find him.  They
say he had a drug store in, in 'Liazabeth City, New Jersey.
AL:      How old is your mother?
BJ:       My mother is 72.
AL:
BJ:       No-o.  The last time I heard about him [is]was when I wrote
to, ah, ah, Aunt Nin.  An' that's been a long time, now.  He was
alive then.
AL:      What was he doing?
BJ:       She said last she had heard from him was 6 years, but he,
he was in ah Fladah, he had been in Fladah.  Ah, then I heard that
he was in ah, ah, Fort Dallas, Georgia.  Which I [hea] had heard
before an' sho' 'nuf,                   he was there
I don't know where he is now.  Might be dead.  Might be livin'.
Might be somewhere near, near around here.  I may, I may have
sisters an' brothers. . .You never can tell. . .But I ain't [worried] gonna worry
                                        They, they up there an' got a whole lot
of stuff      .
I ain't lookin' over 'em or nothin', but I jus' don't want them
to think that I come so far an', an' I'm lookin' for sumpin'.
I ain't lookin' for a thing.  Whatever I get natchurally, honestly,
my own self.
