Dear Dr. Beck:

I am very grateful for your generousity and interest in my
work. I shall write Mr. Lutman at once and try to get a look at
his reminences. Holbrook's book I find rather repetitous and
somewhat lacking in regional understanding, although, of course,
it is the best piece of work in the field. I would like a lot 
more Lumber Jack and less Holbrook per page. A book of life
histories and stories transcribed from the old old lumber jacks
that you know , would not only be a valuable contribution, but
a commercial success.

Time was too short for me to record any of Perry Allan's,
although, of course, I realized that he has a great deal of
material. I am still concerned with getting a machine out to
Michigan to visit you within the next nine months, in the meantime,
many thanks, and very best regards.
