Music    Mr. V. W. Clapp

June 18, 1942

Attached is a supplemental memorandum from Col. Bouvé 
with regard to the so-called rights of folk-singers whose
performances have been recorded by the Library of Congress.
As you will note, Col. Bouvé does not believe that a folk-
singer can claim to be an interpretive performer in the sense
that Fred Waring or Paul Whiteman have made such claims in
the cases cited. If this viewpoint is correct, the Library
of Congress is not obligated to obtain releases from the
singers whenever it duplicates by pressing any of the records
in its collection. Moreover, I should like to emphasize at
this point that the Library in offering pressings for sale
to the public or sending them to Latin America, is acting
solely in the interests of patriotism, science and education.
This is further emphasized by the statement* on the record-
labels which shows intent even if such statement is not
legally binding on anyone.

If the above considerations are correct, the question
arises why should the Library reimburse the singers in any 
case? I have asked Mr. Lomax to prepare a memorandum
justifying this practice, which you will find attached.  I
am inclined to agree with Mr. Lomax's viewpoint. I should
like to point out, however, that Mr. Lomax indicates that
some of the singers did make reservations with regard to
the pressing of their records. He assured me, however, that
he had obtained definite releases from the singers who made
such reservations and that the matter was never discussed
with the prisoners who cannot be located at present or by
the few anonymous performers whose names we do not even
know. I asked him for a definite statement indicating these
by name and number. This he has done in the third document
attached.

In view of the study of the problem as presented above
and in the attached documents, I trust that you will agree
to give further consideration to the issuance of the phonograph
records and authorize us to proceed with the entire
program as originally planned and set forth in my memorandum
of May 22.

Respectfully submitted,
