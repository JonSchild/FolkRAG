College - Sophomore - Negro - Female

1. Did you hear about the girl writing
to a soldier for an engagement ring
to wear until the duration of the
war.
2. I'm sure everyone has heard
about the moron studying all night
for a blood test.
3. Of course you have heard of 
the moron going to the movie
early to sit on the front seat to
be the first one to see the picture
title "Action" and to see a soldier for
his first time.
4. Whenever the boys receive their
greetings from Uncle Sam they
go from girl to girl saying Will you?
and the girl replies, Marry you?
Yes, I'll marry you.
5. College girls motto is "Give me
a pair of khaki pants"
