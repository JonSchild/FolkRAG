Trouble in the Land.

Trouble in the land will soon be over, (3)
Well, all over this world. . .  (HAllelujah!)

All over this world, my lordy,
All over this world,
All over this sinful world,
All over this world.

Preachin in this land will soon be over, etc. .

Shoutin in this land will soon be over, etc. .
