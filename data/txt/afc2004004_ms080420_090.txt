(Sh.)  come at me with those snakes!"
AL:  Would youall have any songs about snakes?  We have one out
in Texas, I wonder if you ever heard. . .my daddy used to sing to me,
like this:  "A nice young man went out to mow/ to see if he could
make a show/ Come a rattlerattlerootaree/ he scares that mow
that frown the (unint)/ jump a rattle come a snake, bit him on
the heel/ come a rattle come a roorahree/ He laid right down
upon the ground and shut his eyes and looked all around/ Come a 
rattle come a roorahree/ Oh pappy dad, go tell my gal, for I'm
goin' to die, and I know I shall/ Come a rattle. ./ Oh Sal, why don't
you know, when they grass gets ripe, it's gotta get mowed/. . ."
(laughter).  You ever hear one about an old ram, it had long horns
ALL:  Oh yeah!
Sheila:  Yeah, Cass does that one.
Cass:  No, that's an odd one, that's not the one he's thinking of.
Nell:  No, I bet it ain't, go ahead
AL:  Let's hear about the one you know. . .(all talk)
