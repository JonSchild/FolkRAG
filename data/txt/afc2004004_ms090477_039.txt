ALAN: Bill, how many women have you had in - in your life if you add them altogether..
BILL: What do you mean?
ALAN: Every one, I mean every one you ever slept with..
BILL: Well-uh, that's a very few. 'Cause I-I'm very slow about that, now to tell you 
the truth about that. I-I've been aroun' an' go out on parties with women 
an' play an' laugh an' talk with women. But-uh I never jus' say corresponded  (?)
an' been out-uh with a mean-uh go to bed with this woman an' that woman, I never

year 1893 back un-uh, well it was June, the 26th day of June. An'-uh I 
was in the Army, I never fool with a woman the whole time I was in the Army, 
see? An' I never got a furlough, nothin'-no-nothin' but a pass to go up

me... Well I did-uh monkey aroun' with a coupla girls before I went to the 
Army, an' I thought that was somethin' that you had to-have to do. But 
after I went to the Army an' I stayed in the Army an' I got along so well, 
when I come out I weighed 2 hunnerd an 12. An'-uh I figgered that *uh it was
nonsense to jus' run aroun' with this woman an' that woman, you know what I 
mean? Co'se I've seed a lot of women that I would like to get a-holt of as 
far as that's concerne'. But-uh jus' for me jus' runnin' up an'-uh, 'cause
