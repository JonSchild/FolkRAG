The folklore meeting in Denton was beautiful; Pres.Hubbard certainly put the big kettle in the little one to make everything just exactly right.  Did your father sen you Jess Morris's letter about how his critics had to backtrack after they saw his picture in LIFE, "even if LIFE din't use may name." It seems he got big write-ups in the Dalhart and Amarillo papers. We had good times with them here.  A week ago Saturday Harry Stephens spent the day and recorded some songs, stories, etc.  Railroad Smith spent the afternoon with us.

I must get this into the mail keep us informed about your wanderings. Remember that I've loved you since i first set eyes on you and will always wish you the greatest success and the best happiness possible. I'm mighty proud to be your loving
