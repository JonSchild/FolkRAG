Dear Miss McGill,

In planning a recording trip to the Eastern part of Kentucky
for the Archive of American Folk Song[,] in the Library[l] of Congress,
I found your book and [hoped that I could perhaps ask] felt sure that by asking your advice
about singers and singing communities in that section, I would [make] 
establish some valuable contacts in that area.

As you perhaps know the Archive of America Folk Song is
devoting itself to the accumulation of American folk-songs in the
form of manuscripts, cylinder and phonographic recordings.  It is interested
in preserving  , as the transcript in some ways fails to
do, the style and the manner of American folk-songs.  It has on hand
at present over a thousand [record] doub[e]le sided records made in the
field and [the Kentucky] two months in Kentucky should make a valuable
regional addition to this collection.

I note that you have transcribed ballads in Knott and Letcher [Cou]
Counties.  Which communities and singers in these counties do you
remember as being the most interesting?

May I hope to hear from you sometime before September the first?
                                                   
Sincerely yours,
