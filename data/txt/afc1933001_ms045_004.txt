see our youngest child (John H. Payne)
graduate at Kelly Field. He is here on
furlough now, but will report to
Kelly Field next week, get his commission 
as 2nd Lieutenant in the 
Air Corps, and then go to Barksdale
Field in Shreveport, La. to do 2 years
service as a young officer in the service.
I hope all your people are well.
Please remember Mrs. P. and me
most cordially to "Miss Ruby," and
all the rest of your family who 
may be with you.
Most cordially yours,
[A.?] W. Payne, X.
