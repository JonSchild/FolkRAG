November 15, 1962

Dear Alan:

After talking with you this evening I double-checked
with Rae and made one grand effort, at last coming up with the
record of Hobart Smith's payment. "Claude Allen" is the only 
thing of his to have been released thus far and, as you will
see on the enclosed copy, he was payed $15.00. I hope this
will help him a little.

We are looking forward to seeing you next December 3.
With best wishes,
Cordially yours,

Donald L. Leavitt
