Mr. Elmer Davis
Office of War Information
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Davis:

I notice reports of the study being made by
the OWI of the problem concerning wild rumors
which circulate over the country. It brought
to mind an incident several months ago in which
such a rumor came to our attention, and I thought
perhaps those in your office concerned with this
might be interested in our handling of this 
particular case.

It occurs to me that some way might be evolved
for newspapers to join in squelching rumors
by some method as direct as this.

Sincerely yours,
Coleman Harwell
