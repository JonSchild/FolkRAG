For the administration, as well as for employees, it is easier
to work with informed impersonal committees.

Occasionally it is possible for a government worker by himself
to adjust a grievance, but he prefers ordinarily to have his case
presented by the union adjustment committee.

Union adjustment committees are not just a chairman and two
union members.

When a union adjustment committee speaks it doesn't speak 
for a half dozen people.

Union adjustment committees speak for all the members of a 
union. The entire membership of the national union is behind its 
every word.

There is strength in a union.

Union adjustment committees aren't intimidated by a supervisor,
they aren't bashful just because they are speaking to a 
section chief.

Union adjustment committees are impersonal, they don't give
or take offense. They speak without any consciouness of inequality,
and because they are impersonal there are no personality
clashes.

Union adjustment committees become expert at handling adjustments.
They know rules and procedures.

When an adjustment committee speaks after making its own
investigation, it speaks with authority. What it says is listened
to carefully when an individual's story might be brushed aside.

But Why Bother?

Prompt and satisfactory adjustment of grievances is esstential
for two reasons. It is the government's employee's right. He has
a right to security, to freedom from discrimination, and to receive
promotions on his job provided that they are consonant with
his own ability and the needs of the government service.

Secondly, the United States Government and the people of the 
United States, to which it is responsible, have a right to demand 
the best possible government service, and a constantly improving
government service.
