-7- MICHIGAN

A Detroit business analyst retails to us the following secondhand
conversation which he said was passed along to him by a trusted
friend. The friend has an engineer acquaintance. The engineer was waiting
to get into the Army and took a job with the Hudson Navel Arsenal as a
stop-gap.
"I quit," the engineer is quoted as saying, "because I was
pretty much disgusted. I was on the night shift. When a man went to
work, if he was a valiant union member, the first thing he wanted to know was
how many units had been made on that particular machine by the previous [*7b*]
shift or the previous day so that he would not vary, doing just so much
and no more."
Newspaper reporter: "I understand The Detroit News has called
together 20 war contractors in Michigan for a meeting August 17 to make
affidavits on specific cases where the unions have slowed down production [*7b*]
in their plants. These are firms which have no materials shortages. At
least, they have adequate materials to carry on the operations which they
say the unions are limiting and because of which firms like Ford are
running short of bearings and Chrysler short of tank gears." August 15 noon.
The meeting apparently will give identification to a complainant
mentioned only anonymously in a Detroit News editorial of August 13 which 
said in part: "The News has specific, though hearsay, knowledge of one
such case in Detroit which, we are told, is slowing a very important phase
of airplane production. So far we have found no one willing to talk about
it. If the President will expose and denounce the practice, he can put an
end to it. Just that much encouragement is all the patriotic worker needs
