War and Rumors
     Rumors are created by war conditions such as an influx
into a community of strangers, whether workers or soldiers; the 
need for abrupt adjustment to shortages; reduced transportation,
etc. Additional causes are heightened concern with special war
problems, industrial production, strategy, foreign relations, etc.
     In adjusting to these strains and stresses there is inevitably tension
which, when added to other war tensions, encourages the spread
of rumors.
     Such tensions and uneasiness, inevitable during war, can
best be eased by a continuous flow of news about the war. 
     The antidote to most rumors is information--clear, complete, 
honest news.
     But even the most complete and accurate information about
the war, with its multitude of details, cannot prevent rumors from
springing up. 
     For war increases feelings of anxiety. War sharpens public interest, and focuses public attention upon problems about which full information cannot always be given promptly, or upon situations so complex that even the publication of the known facts does not always provide simple and reassuring explanations. 
     War therefore fosters those conditions in which rumors flourish.
