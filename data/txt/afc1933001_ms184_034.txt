Mr. Casey Smith (or Smith Casey)
Wynne State Farm
R # 1. Box # 1.
Huntsville, Texas

Dear Mr. Smith:

About a month ago we sent you a "voucher"
to sign. It was addressed to "Smith Casey,
Wynne State Farm, Huntsville, Texas", because
that is the way you signed the original
agreement. You have never returned the
voucher, and we can't pay you until we get
it.

In case that one was lost, we are
sending you a new one. Sign it "Smith Casey", 
because it has to be the same as your
signature on the other paper. As soon as
we get this "voucher" back, your check
can be sent to you. You will get the money
in a very short time after you sign and 
return the voucher.

The records will not be ready until
late in August, and that is when we will
send you your copies.

Please send the voucher right away,
so you won't have to wait any longer for
your money.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge
