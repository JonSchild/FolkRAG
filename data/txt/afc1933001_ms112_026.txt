Dearest Shirley & Folks:
I surely enjoyed
the quiet, normal weekend with 
my folks.  I surely enjoyed (repetition) everyone, and
the rest and play I had were most pleasant.

I recommend
Papa and Deanie & Shirley immediately
adopt strict dieting, as prescribed by Shirley, 
as the best and only cure for their varied
troubles. And by strict -- I mean no
overstepping for a month or so to judge
adequately the benefits gained. 

Reminder to 
Father -- 10 years ago today we embarked
for Weatherford, loaded to the gunwales,
[I would] on our big trip.  As for me, I'd
like to be starting once more. 

Enclosed are
keys to Shirley's car. Margaret and I got
together last Sunday night O.K. She had her 
usual thinking cap on and drove on over 
to the S.P. depot. We have discussed the 
matter and are decided that we want Shirley
and children much for the duration. This should
solve a lot of mutual problems and there's no reason
it wouldn't work.  
Much love to all,
Umpty.
