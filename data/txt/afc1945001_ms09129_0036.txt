1.  Four soldiers in Guadalcanal, during a lull in
the fighting, were playing bridge.  Suddenly, the sentry
yelled, "A Jap landing party is attempting to come ashore!"
One soldier got up and said, "I'll take care of them
I'm dummy this hand!"

2.  A man came stealthily up a dark street.  Glancing
furtively around him, he walked up to a small 
entrance in a building.  As a slot in the door opened,
and an evil face leered out, he rasped- "Joe sent
me.  He said I could get a loaf-sliced!"

3.  A woman went around to all the stores in
the city.  At each store she bought canned goods.  When
asked why she bought all of the canned food she said 
"I wanted to get some before the hoarders got it all!!"

4.  At an army flying school, a plane containing two
men took off.  When the plane reached high altitude,
the student pilot yelled to the man in the front
cockpit "Everything's O.K. sir!  How do you bring it down."
The man turned around, "What are you asking me
for, I was only fixing the ear-phones!"
