Mrs. Hones was in her backyard
talking to Mrs. Smith about the food
rationing. Mrs. Jones told Mrs. Smith
that she did not have to worry
about not getting enough food at
the stores because she had horded
enough food in her basement for 
the duration. In the meantime, the 
postman came to Mrs. Smith in front
door, and when she opened the letter which
the mailman had given her, she found
that her son had dies from starvation.
As a result of this , she went to her
local draft board and reported Mrs. 
Jones.
When Johnnie comes marching home
again, there will be a new "Bill of Rights"
for him, in order that he may continue
his education and get a job.
