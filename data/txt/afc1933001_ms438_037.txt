New York City — composed by Huddie Ledbetter

Here, in a few [words] stanzas, you have the sum of Lead Belly's
impressions of New York City and his chief interest in it--
to tell the home-folks a big story when he gets back to Shreveport.
Outside of his comarison of the subway train to an oncoming
thunder shower, the observations are all ours. We told
him that Fifth Avenue could hold more people than New Orleans
and Dallas put together, that Fifth Avenue was the longest street
in the world, that New York City was built on a solid rock.
These three statements, [along with the subways] all more or less erroneous, desperate attempts on our part to amuse his interest, [made a great impression on him;] impressed [him] — but, so far as we can tell,
little else about New York did. The rhymes[, we hasten to add,]
are not ours, [nor is the [?]ar meaningless "petition to the hole
in the ground."]

Here is a cheap, jazzed-up, rhymed up "composition" by a
folk-poet. Here is a sample of what contact with another
idiom that he respects for its popularity can do with a
fine and genuine folk-artist. "An' I don' moan maybe!"
