that maybe I didn't want to play the accordion.
AL:    But your father played the accordion.
Canray:   Yeah, one of the best.   But he was the type of man---
he had a lot of superstitions or something.   He had the idea, 
whenever Adam gonna be a dead man, he gonna be a dead man, he 
didn't want nothing to be held up for him, what he had done,
or anything like that.  And when he told me a lot of thing
that make a lot of sense if you come to think about it.  He 
was a real Frenchman that couldn't write his name, or 
couldn't understand anything in English, not a word in English.
And he told me many times, I was his only son, he had a 
daughter, we two in the family. But he would always take 
care of me and mama was gonna see to my sister, cause [hh] he
said your mama know about women and girls and stuff like that,
but I'm going to teach you something.  Which he told me another

this, don't tell him you're going to do it in the first place.
Whether you're rich or poor, you have to have a word.   I'm
not going to be here forever.   And he taught me a lot of things,
different things,   I remember.....it was pretty tough in 
them times. Mymama gave me a bunch of eggs to go to the store.
We had a neighborhood country store, and she told me, she said
