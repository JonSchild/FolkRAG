Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I approve heartily of  your plans for the bibliography of phonograph 
records. You may remember our discussion on this point almost
two years ago. Go right ahead on this at once.

Please follow my instructions to the letter in your dealings
with the Columbia Phonograph people. Do nothing independently lest
you spoil our entire plans. Do not ask for any records yourself. 
Send your recommendations to me. Your remarks about Mr. John Hammond
show me that you have already misunderstood my letter on the subject.
The President of the A.R.C. (which owns Columbia and others) had
already offered me anything I wanted! The Vice-President, Mr. Wise,
suggested the race records and others but agreed that we should postpone
discussion of this until after you make a survey, Furthermore,
my suggestions to Mr. Wise regarding the possible utilization of
your services (personal) went much further than merely re-editing old
records. I suggested commercial recording trips under your supervision
etc. But do not press this matter! Let him bring it up. I
must insist for your own sake that you leave certain things to me. I 
have absolute confidence in your persuasive powers but wait until I 
indicate when and where you are to apply them. You will be called
upon plenty later. So visit Messrs. Wise and Taylor as soon as possible!
You will find them both delightful. Report to me as soon as you see them.

The Council will not accept your application without a certified
transcript of your college record so see to it that I receive it immediately. 
No applications will be accepted after March 13.

I regret that I cannot straighten the Collet matter for you and 
suggest that you wait until your next trip to Washington to avoid any
further mistakes.

I know nothing about the first Presto letter and, as you know, I 
keep no letters "on my desk." The second letter is returned herewith.
If you want to handle it yourself, do so - otherwise, send it to Mr. 
Bond with a note of explanation.
