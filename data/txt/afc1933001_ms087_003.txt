Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am very glad to have your letter with reference to Bessie
Smith.
Bessie Smith was injured in an automobile accident several
miles out from Clarksdale and was brought to Clarksdale in
a colored ambulance. The car in which she was riding was
smashed and she was in shock when brought to the hospital.
She died some eight or ten hours after admission to the
hospital. We gave her every medical attention, but we
were never able to rally her from the shock.
She was badly broken up, having many fractures of her
limbs and internal injuries.
The negro man who was driving her car was apparently very
drunk. As I remember it, he received very few injuries,
as is often the case.
You may brand the statement that she was refused treatment
as an absolute truth.
If there is any further information that I can give you
on this subject, I will be glad to do so.
Very truly yours,
W.H. Brandon
