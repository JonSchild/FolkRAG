State:  Oklahoma   City:  Norman    Reported by:  Leslie Smith, Operator
Leslie Merle Smith Beauty Shop

Place or circumstances in which rumor passed:  In the beauty shop

Description of the person:  Spends entire time in beauty parlor in a town having a
Naval Base with a civilian population of about 11,000;
seat of the State University.

Rumor:  A woman having her hair dressed in the beauty parlor told this story to the
beauty operator:  The wife of a worker out at the Naval Base told
us the other day that the cancellation of the overtime for her husband cut
his wages down from $120 a week to $80 a week, and she just did not see how
she was going to be able to buy that fur coat with costs of living so high.
Now aint it just too damn bad that she can't get by on $80 a week.
