Cross Road Blues, Robert Johnson,
      Robert Johnson, Perfect 7-05-81 (SA  2629)

I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees,
I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees,
Ast the Lord above -"Have mercy, now, save [this] po' [boy] Bob if you please."

East at the crossroads, tried to flag a rid,
Ee-------, I tried to flag a ride,
Didn' nobody seem to know me, babe, everybody passed me by.

Standin' at the crossroads, baby, risin' sun goin' down,
Standin' at the crossroads, baby, risin' sun goin' down,
I b'lieve to my soul now, po' [boy] Bob was sinkin' down.

You can run, you can run, tell my frien', Willie Brown,
That I got the crossroads blues [hard] this mornin', [I b'lieve], babe, I'm sinkin' down.

I went to the cross roads, mama, I looked East and West,
I went to the cross roads, baby, I looked East and West,
I didn' have no sweet woman, [baby] oo well babe, in my distress
