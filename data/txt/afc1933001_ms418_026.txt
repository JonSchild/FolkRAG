Ballad of a Lumberjack

TRY THIS ON YOUR BANJO-

We guys are sick of being worked like horses at a plow
We won't throw kisses at the boss and scrape our feet
and bow,
We stuck it out with Hoover so we sure can stick it
now!
What d'ya say!
Damn right!
Any day!

We're sick of entertaining lice with a sweet,
"ow do you do?"
And let them take our bedbugs to the Rockefeller
Zoo,
A cockroach has a charming walk but he staggers
in a stew
What d'ya say?
Peee---yooo!

If I were old Paul Bunyan I would be a clever fox...
I'd hitch the vigilanted to the legendary ox...
And when they'd strike, the ox would scab and kick
at them with rocks...

They'd cry...
"Gum...by!"

So let's all get together boys, and take a punch of 
snuff,
This hard life makes the man, they say, but plenty
is enough,
They'll have a hard time breaking us 'cause the hard
life made us tough.

What'd Ya say?
That's right!
We'll fight!
