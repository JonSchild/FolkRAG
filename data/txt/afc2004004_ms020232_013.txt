BJ TAPE 18, p. 11

a crowd had gathered there: "I knowed it!   Ol' Gene Reese did
it!   Nobody did it but him!   Ol' Gene Reese done it! He done
it!"
         Mama said they all looked aroun' 'cause in those days they
call 'im Bud, she said "Bud was home."   Because they had been up
quiltin' that night an' sewin' an' one thing an' another.   An'
Uncle Gene had been there playin' with them until late.   An', an'
[then,] before he even went to his, his room to go to bed.   So,
Uncle Gene, uh, after a while, he [said] set there an' talkin', said
"You know, I ain't did this.   I don't know nothin' about it."
         All right.  "Tell me!   I know the black rascal did it!   He
tuk my wife an' carried 'er off from here; I don't know where
she is now!"
         See? Uncle Gene said, "I don't know where she is." So, [some] so they
[of them] went, they, they got in behind [an' hunted 'er up] that crowd, in a rut.   You know,
where he swore so hard an' all.   An' all.   So they wen' out there
in the woods, in the field an' they found 'is wife.   Tied.   She
said Gene carried 'er out there.
         An' so Uncle Gene said, "I haven't seen you."   You know,
they, they, well, she, an' she couldn' do nothin' but jus' cry,
ya know?   They could almost tell she was lyin'.   An' they said,
so they. . .Tie 'er with a string.   That kinda string, she coulda just
pulled loose or bite it loose, anything, see?   But anyway, they 
got up.   Mama said they come back here.
         Then they have the Sheriff come [to] from Buenavista        ,
High [Sheriff,] big Sheriff, come on out there, diffrunt ones,
diffrunt police.  They took him to (jail?).   Had 'im, had 'im
in this buggy.   Well, they were gonna lynch 'im, ya know.   Ya know
they was gonna lynch 'im.
