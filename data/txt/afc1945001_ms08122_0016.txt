[Lot of people say we]
1  If we win the war
some people [should] say
they should shoot Hitler
right away I don't think
so because they should
make him suffer like
he made the other
people suffer
2.  Other people say if
Hitler dies the war will
end right away. I dont
think so because he still
has the other men
under him and they'll
continue where he left
off
