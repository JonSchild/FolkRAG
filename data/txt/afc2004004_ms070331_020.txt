I'M THINKING TONIGHT OF AN OLD SOUTHERN TOWN

I'm thinking tonight of an old Southern town,
And the loved ones that I left behind.
I know they are naked and hungry too,
And it sure does worry my mind.

Oh, poor little children so hungry and cold,
The rich, might capitalists so big and so bold,
They stole all our land and they stole all our coal;
We get starvation while they get the gold.

I know how it feels to be lonely,
And I know how it is to be blue,
And I know how it is to be naked,
And I sure been hungry too.

I'm thinking of brother and sister,
From the loved ones whom I have to part;
I'm thinking of their little children
Who is so near to my heart.

I'm thinking of the heartache and starvation
That the capitalists have caused me and mine,
I'm thinking of brother and sister
And the loved ones that I left behind.

Now, if I had the rotten capitalists
Where the capitalists has got me
What I wouldn't do to them bastards
Would be a shame to see.
