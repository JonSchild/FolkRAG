Dear Mr. Eaton:

Mr. Charles Seeger has often quoted to me
you story about the old fiddler who told the anecdote
of Napoleon Bonaparte crossing the rockies. I am
compiling a book of folk songs and fiddle tunes along
with my father and I would appreciate it if you would
jot down the story in the words of the fiddler and send
it to me.

Cordially yours,


Alan Lomax
