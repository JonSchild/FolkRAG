been married once before, too - poor simple man - and this woman
had went up there - and her husband was up there and... "O, Margaret
Forbes again."  The doctors were sick of looking at her. "Course,
they knew what she was, you see.  She was just a common prostitute.
And "O, he says, "Margaret Forbes again." And this lady turned
round and said, "She's not Margaret Forbes - she's Mistress Keir
now."  And the man was sitting here.  "Good God!" the doctor
said, "There's a sod born everyday of the week."  Of course, they
were bad.
Lomax: That sort of thing doesn't happen out on the road does it?
Jean: No, no - not that kind of thing.  But in big cities - if you
live in a tenement house, you can't have them living beside you;
and believe me, they're a torment to have that kind of people
biding beside you.  Because they've been away with men at night,
and these men keep revenge upon them.  You might get a crack in
the face instead of them.  You've got to watch...
Lomax: Have you thought of any more songs?
Jean: There must be a song or two...I wouldnahave sang them all.
Did I sing Davy Fea to you? ..."There was once a wealthy farmer
and he had a lovely daughter, and of course, this -- it wasn't
actually a tinker.  As far as I've heard the story he was actually
a young lord, but he went to the house as a tinker because he
didn't want her to fall in love with him for his money or his
title; he wanted her to fall in love for what he was.  So he acted
as a tinker, mending pots and panson the road.  And the song will
tell the rest...
1) For there was awealthy farmer lived in the North country,
He had a lovely daughter who was always frank and free.
And day by day and night by night she was always in my eye.
2) So there was a jolly tinker lad came tae the farmhouse,
"It is have you any pots or pans or candlesticks to mend?
Or have you any lodgins for me, a single man?
The farmer he thought it nae harm the tinker for to keep,
And the lassie she thought it nae harm the tinker's bed to make.
3) But the tinker followed after her and he did bar the door,
He's catched her by the middle small and he laid her on the floor
He's catched her by the middle small and up against  a wall,
And it was there he's ta'en the wills of her before she won awa'.
4) The bonnie lassie blused, and o but she thought shame,
"It's since ye ta'en the wills o' me, come tell to me your name."
He whispered in the lassie's ear, "The call me Davy Fae,
And you'll mind upon the happy nicht among the pile of straw."
5) Ere six weeks had past and gone, this maid grew white and pale,
Nine months and better brought her forth a bonny son,
And since the baby's born, I will call him Davy Fae',
And I'll mind upon the happy nicht amongst the pile of' straw.
