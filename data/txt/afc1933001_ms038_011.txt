"Los Pastores or the Nativity Play which has become a prt
of San Antonio from its earliest days is a combination of a
Shepherd's play and a Morality play with the introduction of
several characters to represent Evil.

["] There are no early Spanish or Mexican plays with the
plot of the San Antonio Los Pastores. Compared with any of
the Mexican Nativity Plays the San Antonio is superior
in design and execution. Evidently the San Antonio play was
an early adaptation by someone, probably the missionary, well
versed in the Spanish dramas popular at the time.

The play Los Pastores was first given in the Missions.
When the Missions were secularized, the people took the play
to their homes. Thus began the custom of organizing troupes
of players in different localities by men who could neither
read nor write, and who learned their parts as their leader
repeated them, line by line.
The rehearsals were as important and enjoyed as much as
the final performance.
The play was usually given out of doors to an audience
diverse in interests and appearance but one in passions and
beliefs.

The San Antonio version of Los Pastores as a whole is
now lost. The play has become a compilation of parts of
several versions of the play. The hideous masks, an Azted
note, the ludicrous costumes, the character of the Indian, are
alien to the simple, joyous, Shepherd's Play of early days.

crook, the quaint lullabies, and several of the main characters
