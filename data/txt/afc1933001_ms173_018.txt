Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
Memphis, Tenn.

Dear Alan:

   From a friend to a friend, I was shocked and not
very happy about your news concerning the Mexico City Conference
and Sterling Fisher.  I am sorry to say that I heard somewhat
similar reports about other of his activities from different
sources, and it is the kind of news that is both impossible to
keep to oneself and pretty unpleasant to have to do something
about.  I hope that we will get the gist of what you mean from
other sources so that I don't have to ask you for details.

   Your suggestion about Bess definitely interests
me - not only because I fell for her, as you may remember, but
because I think she might be very useful around here.  I'm sure
you have told her to look me up when she comes to New York, and
I assure you it will be a pleasure to do all I can for her.

   I envy you your current recording activities and
I know you must be having a swell time at them.  Incidentally,
you know Memphis is my old home town so the least you can do is
enjoy it for me.  I wish you'd drop me a line whenever you get a
chance and let me know something of the interesting experiences you
must be running into.

Cordially,
Bill
