HYMN TO WORLD UNITY
(Bach Choral)


To all the nations now we call,
An international world to praise,
That we may make all people free,
Our plea for unity we raise.


We are all one, united here,
Though claiming many lands by birth.
Clear understanding now we seek
With all the nations of the earth.


NATIONS COME AND JOIN US

(Manuscript - Obtainable from Affiliated Schools - .5Â¢.)


Nations come and join us
Not with swords or muskets
But with arms and souls of peace.
Side by side march onward,
Till the reign of war shall cease.
Clear the weeping and the swearing field.
Plant it with a peaceful seed to yield
A people strong and friendly
To build a land of plenty,
Not for one, but all for all.
