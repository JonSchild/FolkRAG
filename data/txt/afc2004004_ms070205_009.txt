[The Red Light Saloon]

I have a silk overcoat, costly
& brown
and I think if no haven
love in the lying it down
She lied down upon it I'd seek 
he devine
and I raised up the linen
and the drapery so fine
Her two thighs extended between
them I flew
And I near lost my sight
in that light evening dew
Ed. McCormick, 56,
Newberry, Mich. heard
this when a boy, remembers now
only a fragment..
