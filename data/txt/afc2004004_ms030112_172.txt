LARRY:
You had somebody living it one time.
MRS. DAVIS:
But they still there, it ain't no good.
LARRY:
Yeah, Brother Davis told me they was tearing the house. He told me about that.
MRS. DAVIS:
You see that house was new and beautiful, it was 3 years before anybody lived in it, because he didn't want anybody to live in it. 3 long years and we paid insurance on the house somebody supposed to live in that house and one day I was over there and I went in the post office and put up a sign that the house was for rent. Then a lot of people called in. Then I let somebody have it. Our house is right near a Reverend Church
on Beth Avenue. He had two houses for sale.
LARRY:
I don't know anything about no preachers.
MRS. DAVIS:
No. Around 125th Street, in New York they go out there once in a while, but they got two houses one for their family one for theirselves. But his house is right near ours. But use it on weekends.
LARRY:
So did Brother Davis ever tell you he like to read his Braille. Did he learn it here or down south.
MRS. DAVIS:
He learned it down South someplace, but he was getting ready
