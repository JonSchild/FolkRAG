Dear Mr. Lomax:

          You made "the Keatings" and their friends
very happy yesterday, and Mrs. Keating and I want
you to know we are deeply appreciative.

          A few had to slip away because of Easter
Sunday engagements, but I am sure the others would
have been willing to remain there the greater part
of the afternoon if Mr. Vance and you had continued
to sing.

          It was a great success, and Mrs. Keating
and I are very anxious you should know how much we 
appreciated your contribution.

                                    Sincerely,



                                     [Edward Keating]
