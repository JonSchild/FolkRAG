CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT.
1. As used in this contract, "air waybill" is equivalent to "air consignment
note", "shipper" is equivalent to "consignor", "carriage" is 
equivalent to "transportation" and "Carrier" includes the air carrier
issuing this air waybill and all air carriers that carry the goods hereunder 
or perform any other services related to such air carriage. For the
purposes of the exemption from and limitation of liability provisions set
forth or referred to herein, "Carrier" includes agents, servants, or representatives
of any such air carrier. Carriage to be performed hereunder
by several successive carriers is regarded as a single operation.
2. (a) Carriage hereunder is subject to the rules relating to liability
established by the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating
to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw, October 12, 1929,
(hereinafter called "the Convention"), unless such carriage it not "International
carriage" as defined by the Convention. (See Carrier's Tariffs
for such definition).
(b) To the extent not in conflict with the foregoing, carriage hereunder
and other services performed by each Carrier are subject to (i)
applicable laws (including national laws implementing the Convention),
government regulations, orders, and requirements, (ii) provisions herein
set forth, and (iii) applicable tariffs, rules, regulations and timetables (but
not the times of departure and arrival therein) of such carrier, which are
made part hereof and which may be inspected at any of its offices and at
airports from which it operates regular services.
(c) For the purposes of the Convention, the agreed stopping places
(which may be altered by Carrier in the case of necessity) are those places,
except the place of departure and the place of destination, set forth on the
face hereof or shown in Carrier's timetables as scheduled stopping places
for the route.
(d) In the case of carriage subject to the Convention, the shipper
acknowledges that he has been given an opportunity to make a special
declaration of the value of the goods at delivery and that the sum entered
on the face of the air waybill as "Shipper's/Consignor's Declared Value
for Carriage". If in excess of 250 French gold francs (consisting of 654 milligrams
of gold with a fineness of 900 thousandths) or their equivalent per
kilogram, constitutes such special declaration of value.
3. Insofar as any provision contained or referred to in this air waybill may
be contrary to mandatory law, government regulations, orders, or requirements,
such provision shall remain applicable to the extent that it is not
overridden thereby. The invalidity of any provision shall not affect any
other part hereof.
4. Except as the Convention or other applicable law may otherwise
require :
(a) Carrier is not liable to the shipper or to any other person for any
damage, delay or loss of whatsoever nature (hereinafter collectively
referred to as "damage") arising out of, or, in connection with the carriage
of the goods, unless such damage is proved to have been caused by the
negligence or wilful fault of Carrier and there has been no contributory
negligence of the shipper, consignee or other claimant ;
(b) Carrier is not liable for any damage directly or indirectly arising
out of compliance with laws, government regulations, orders or requirements
or from any cause beyond Carrier's control ;
(c) the charges for carriage having been based upon the value
declared by the shipper, it is agreed that any liability shall in no event
exceed the shipper's declared value for carriage stated on the face hereof,
and in the absence of such declaration by shipper, liability of Carrier shall


not exceed 250 French Gold francs, or their equivalent per kilogram of
goods destroyed, lost, damaged or delayed ; all claims shall be subject to
proof of value ;
(d) a carrier issuing an air waybill for carriage exclusively over the
lines of others does so only as a sales agent.
5. It is agreed that no time is fixed for the completion of carriage hereunder
and that Carrier may without notice substitute alternate carriers or
aircraft. Carrier assumes no obligation to carry the goods by any specified
aircraft or over any particular route or routes or to make connection at
any point according to any particular schedule, and Carrier is hereby
authorised to select, or deviate from, the route or routes of shipment,
notwithstanding that the same may be stated on the face hereof. The
shipper guarantees payment of all charges and advances.
6.The goods, or packages said to contain the goods, described on the
face hereof, are accepted for carriage from their receipt at Carrier's
terminal or airport office at the place of departure to the airport at the
place of destination. If so specifically agreed, the goods, or packages said
to contain the goods, described on the face hereof, are also accepted for
forwarding to the airport of departure and for reforwarding beyond the
airport of destination. If such forwarding or reforwarding is by carriage
operated by Carrier, such carriage shall be upon the same terms as to
liability as set forth in Paragraphs 2 and 4 hereof. In any other event, the
issuing carrier and last carrier, respectively, in forwarding or reforwarding
the goods, shall do so only as agents of the shipper, owner, or consignee,
as the case may be, and shall not be liable for any damage arising out of such
additional carriage, unless proved to have been caused by its own negligence
or willful fault.  The shipper, owner and consignee hereby authorise such
carriers to do all things deemed advisable to effect such forwarding or
reforwarding, including, but without limitation, selection of the means of
forwarding or reforwarding and the routes thereof (unless these have been
herein specified by the shipper), execution and acceptance of documents
of carriage (which may include provisions exempting or limiting liability)
and consigning of goods with no declaration of value notwithstanding
any declaration of value in this air waybill.
7. Carrier is authorised (but shall be under no obligation) to advance any
duties, taxes or charges and to make any disbursements with respect to the
goods, and the shipper, owner and consignee shall be jointly and severally
liable for the reimbursement thereof. No Carrier shall be under obligation
to incur any expense or to make any advance in connection with the
forwarding or reforwarding of the goods except against repayment by the
shipper. If it is necessary to make customs entry of the goods at any place,
the goods shall be deemed to be consigned at such place to the person
named on the face hereof as customs consignee or, if no such person be
named, to the carrier carrying the goods to such place or to such customs
consignee, if any, as such carrier may designate.
8. If the appropriate premium is paid, the goods covered by this air
consignment note are insured on behalf of the consignor under an open
policy in the amount of the consignor's declared value for insurance set
forth on the face hereof, (recovery being limited to the actual loss or 
damage) subject to the terms and conditions of such open policy. The
policy includes cover in respect of war, strikes, riots, hostilities or legal
seizure except in certain territories, particulars of which may be obtained
from the carrier. The terms and conditions of the open policy are available
for inspection by the consignor. Claims should be reported to any
office of the carrier.
9. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract delivery of
the goods will be made only to the consignee named on the face hereof,
unless such consignee is one of the Carriers participating in the carriage,
in which event delivery shall be made to the person indicated on the face
hereof as the person to be notified. Notice of arrival of the goods will, in
the absence of other instructions, be sent to the Consignee, or the person
to be notified, by ordinary methods ; Carrier is not liable for non-receipt
or delay in receipt of such notice.
10. (a) No action shall be maintained in the case of damage to goods
unless a written notice, sufficiently describing the goods concerned, the
approximate date of the damage, and the details of the claim, is presented
to an office of Carrier within 7 days from the date of receipt thereof, in
the case of delay unless presented within 14 days from the date the goods
are placed at the disposal of the person entitled to delivery, and in the
case of loss (including non-delivery) unless presented within 120 days
from the date of issue of the air waybills.
(b) Any rights to damages against Carrier shall be extinguished
unless an action is brought within two years after the occurrence of the
events giving rise to claim.
11. The shipper shall comply with all applicable laws, customs and other
government regulations of any country to, from, through or over which the
goods may be carried, including those relating to the packing, carriage or
delivery of the goods, and shall furnish such information and attach such
documents to this air waybill as may be necessary to comply with such laws
and regulations. Carrier is not liable to the shipper or any other person
for loss of expense due to shipper's failure to comply with this provision.
12. No agent, servant, or representative of Carrier has authority to
alter, modify or waive any provision of this contract.
