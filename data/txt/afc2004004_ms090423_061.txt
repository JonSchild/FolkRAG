Interview with Joe Cal

Joe Cal's present family is an all male family on the King & Anderson plantation; when asked concerning this he said:

Well, you see, I'se been with more 'n one woman, and 
that last one I was with - she didn't want to act no 
right, so even if she wanted to she had to get out.  And 
I hadn't been with her no more 'n a year.  In fact she 
ain't hardly been up here from Texas longer than a year.  
Oh yeah we was married, but now we's separated.  She live 
right up there.  She got out and took her bout six kids, 
that was already hers and made her a crop of her own, 
and took care of them children.  Man that woman can 
really work; can pick four or five hundred pounds of 
cotton a day.

To tell you the truth, there ain't but two kinds of 
folks that ain't slaves in this here man's land and 
that's the white man and the nigger woman.  It used to 
be just the white man, cause I remembers when there was 
no separating like there is now.  A woman couldn't just 
get up and go once she done left home and been married 
to a man.  If she got in her head anything like that, 
her folks would just pack her right back on up and bring 
her to her man.  But now a days they is practically all 
free.  They can do most they wants to do.  Leave when-so-never 
they get ready, run round with white men, and 
most everything.  Same thing go for the white man, but 
the poor nigger man and the white woman, they is the 
ones that's catching it.  They'll lynch a nigger for 
fooling with a white woman and run the white woman out 
for fooling with a nigger; but the white man and a 
colored woman can get together any time.

One time I pulls a gun on a white agent and was wanting 
to get away from here, but old man Anderson told me 
I better not think bout no getting away.  Well I just 
figured that things was getting bad, so I went up and 
told a bad, gun toting, shooting, white man bout how 
things was, and he sent old King and Anderson word 
that he was sending his trucks down and he wasn't expecting
