Mr. John Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax,

    I have been unpardonably neglectful in not answering your
recent letter. Your information about the next issue of Cowboy
songs and other frontier ballads is indeed pleasant. And the
publisher's advertising circular is most impressive. Thanks
for sending me a copy.

    The folk songs you enclosed were turned over to Dr. Spivacke
who will decide in their ultimate disposal.

    Of course the children got your verses, and liked them.
I can report that we had a very happy Christmas. The fishing
possibilities down there must be a great attraction. As for me -
I'm just marking time until the baseball season opens!

    In haste, but no less sincerely,

ENW
