Evidence of an Apparently Organized, Special Anti-semitic
Drive amongst the Irish


Within the past few days, from three different sources, the identical
anti-semitic item was sent in. Below is a copy of it. From Chester, Pa.,
mailed December 2, a "dittoed" copy ves received, from New York we received
a typed carbon copy, with the information that a friend of our informant
had been given this same Item, printed on a card, by a National Guard officer,
and also that a correspondent of his had reported it in Baltimore;
printed on yellow paper it was sent in by [a] Long Ieland (New York) resident,
who reported that it was being circulated "in the vicinity of a Government-
operated trade school in Yonkers, New York."

The identity of the wording of this complicated passage, the evidence that
it is being distributed on a relatively lerge scale in a variety of centers,
the implication that it is directed toward a porticular group within our
community all suggest that it represents the result of some malicious,
orgenized activity. Your attention is called to this for purposes of
referral to the eporopriate euthorities for investigation and action.
