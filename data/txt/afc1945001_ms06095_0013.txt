The Russian Front:
There has been considerable comment on the
possibility of the Russian Front holding, however, nothing
has been noted that could be considered a rumor. The 
general opinion expressed is that if the Russian Front
does not hold we are in for a long war, therefore, something
should be done. [*50*]
