2.

and interesting for release by the Library, and 2. To get
some good cowboy songs. In the latter regard, I still think
that Folk-Lore Society of which you're president should furnish
many contacts. I also think that the trip ought to be
hemi-demi sponsored by the University of Texas and Folk-Lore
Society with the view of depositing duplicates of the Texas
records as the basis of the Texas Folk Song Archive. Alex
Moore should be rerecorded on acetate, So should the Gants.
Bill Kitrell can give you the names of two or three cowboy
singers of great interest in Texas who should be recorded.
I'm very enthusiastic about railroad songs recorded enscene.
Vance Randolph in the Ozarks is supposed to have traced a
good bit of Mountain material and should be located. However,
the idea of going to a plantation in Mississippi is one that
makes my mouth water. Mrs. Tart is always good. I'm sure you
could find good material in Dallas if you try and I would as it
will come in handy for broadcasting and lecture programs right
at your front door.

7. The last time I saw Dr. Davis and the Wards, they
promised to take me back in the mountains to see all kinds of
musical fanfares. (By the way), what was Dr. Davis's answer
about the material for the book? The sherrif of Perry Co., Ky.,
Justing C. Begley, is one of the finest banjo players and ballad
singers in America. It would be worth while going by and record
his complete repertoires on acetate and if I write him, I imagine
he'll open up avenues to you all through that mountain country.

8. About the machine, we can send you either a small portable
Presto or the larger (but still lighter than Lincoln Thompson)
and handier to use than Presto, Model Y. Model Y will make
practically professional records with care, but it may take some
practice to get the best results out of it. It's a little more
complicated. Pictures of both are enclosed.

9. I always greatly enjoy your enclosures and friendly
casual notes. Please realize I always come to your defense in
the Leadbelly matter and it is never mentioned by Leadbelly  except
with regret for his foolishness. I'll visit Mr. Houston
and write Mrs. Winterbottom and also send you the material of
This Singing Country this week end. Spivacke will send you formal
notice as soon as the form has been reformed and remade. Meantime,
go ahead and plan your trip for Sept. 1.

10. Enclosed you'll find a number of address cards. Pick
out those that you think you'll use and send them to me. I'll
write these people from here which will save you a lot of trouble.

Most sincerely,
