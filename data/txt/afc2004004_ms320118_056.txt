(Carl) the local climate and topography.
AL:  Of course in Nova Scotia these new Americans learned
a lot from the Indians.  The Indians had an advanced
culture here, they knew the woods, they knew the plant
life, they knew animals.
Carl:  That's right.  I remember when the Acadians first came
to North America, they worked for roughly 5 years as
(unint) woodsman, working very closely on a day to day
basis with the local tribes.  From the Indians in the
Nova Scotia area the Acadians learned to adopt a seasonally
oriented system of economic pursuits.  In the winter, for
example, they often joined the Indians for hunting parties
and much of the trapping was done in the winter season.
In the spring, the crops were planted, and also the Acadia
fished for shell fish, in the Indian style, along the Nova
Scotia coast.  In the summer, there were fishing expeditio
farther out to sea, sometimes occasionally out as far as th
Grand Banks.  In the fall, naturally, they were preoccupie
with the harvest.  The seasonal cycle would be reestablish
here in Louisiana.
AL:  And of course the Indians could tell them how to adjust
to the alligators, and (unint) possoms, and 'coons, and
rattlesnakes, and water moccasins, and all the denisens of
the Central Swamp area.
