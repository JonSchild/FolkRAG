My Dear Mr. & Mrs. Lomax,
Dear Friends if I 
may call you such, I 
was very glad to recieve 
your letter even though I 
did not act like it. 
I was not sure where 
I should write until Sun. 
last, when Mr. Brewster 
visited us again. So 
he said a letter would 
eventually reach you 
directed as I shall 
address this one. 
Yes Mr. Brewster spent 
"Mothers day" with us. 
We were very glad to 
have him and all
