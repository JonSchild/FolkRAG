Some of the following songs
are some I've never heard
over the air that Mrs. Mary
McMahon sings.

Oh Yes! I'm a Rogish Boy Now.
Papa, What would you take for me.
Way down east amoung the mts.
Soldiers must fight you know.
(There is a swell story connected
with Mrs. M.'s Mother that goes with
that song)

Temper your justice with mercy,
For I was once your wife.

Old Nicker Brinigan had a 
Bull Pup.

The Bashfull Country Lover.
Three Wishes.

I have seen audiances clap her 
back not less than 3 times
many times. She's lived
in many towns in Maine
and every where she's ever
lived or visited people have
begged for [them] her to entertain
them. She has a low voice
and plays her own accompan-
iament on the organ.

She has a son who has
a very nice voice who is very
popular too. Especially if he
sings some of her old songs.
He has been taking a few
vocal lessons recently as
Station W.C.O.U. Lewiston said
they could use him if he would.
He went to Bates one year and
sang in the Glee Club all year.
He is going to Bliss Business College now.
