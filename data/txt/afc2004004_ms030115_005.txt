Reel 1 - Comments- Joan Fenton.

1. Blow Gabriel — sloppy guitar work, guitar out
of tune. [The] I would use the
recorded version — not this version
2.  sound fades in and out - is it any better
on original? Should be compared to
version on Pure Religion & Blind Faith.
Guitar work good -- nice to listen to him
talking. Gets better as goes along
3. twelve sticks — good.
4. Devils Dream — interesting, but. find it drags — I prefer
the record version better — this would be 
hard for someone who didn't know Gary
to listen to & get into
5. Twelve Gates — I think 12 Gates and/or Samson
and delilah should be included [on the] in the film
because they are his most well know.
6. This is not the Best Version — the best
version is on The Live at Newport Album
7. Lost John — I think this song isn't on any record, so
for that reason it would be nice to include
good tune — a little bit long.
8. Death Don't Have No Mercy —
I'll check for best version.
9. O Lord — good hard tune 
10. O Glory How Happy I am — is one of Gary's best Gospel
tunes. Great introduction. I really like this — very powerful
11. This song & talking on the corner show a side of Gary not
reflected in the other songs. I like this cause its live 
its also kinda long.
