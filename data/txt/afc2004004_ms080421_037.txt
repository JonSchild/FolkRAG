thing 'til 19 and 56, and I happened to notice it bein' curly,
and I pulled it out and made a dulcimer out of it. And the nicks
on here, it made a trip all the way to Fort Yukon, Alaska. It came
back, I sent the dulcimer up there and the third fret on it, he
didn't write me before he sent it back, if he had I'd just told him
what's done to it ... corrected it. He just packed it and sent
it back and wrote a note in it. And when I got it out of the mail 
I got them nicked and one hurt ...
... and the strings and three of the pegs, that's
all I got back.

AL: I'd like your wife to say somethin' about these flowers

HP: Yeh, I draw this on here just by hand, /I don't have a pattern, just draw it on

HP: Everyone of 'em is different.

EP: Neither one come out the same.

HP: 'Cause I don't have no pattern to draw by, just take a
pencil and draw it.

AL: You all actually make your living now with crafts purely, 
don't you?

EP: Yeah, what livin' we have, we make it, sometimes we don't
have very much to eat, but we get by. You don't make a lot of money
