4. A fellow was telling me there are a bunch of 16,17,  and 18
year old boys at the Fort--none of them making less than $10.00 a day
and some earning $18.00 a day. Kids who never had a job before. That's
really going to make it tough on them some day when they have to work
for $18.00 or $20.00 a week, or even less than that. (Laborer told this
to a Business man.)  Helena, Mont. Aug 4  12
