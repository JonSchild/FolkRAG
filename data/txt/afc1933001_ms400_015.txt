Adventures of a Ballad-Hunter

He talks over his shoulder to his Captain, his big boss-man:

Ask my captain to give me a dime;
"Say, old nigger, you a dime behin'".

Ask my captain did the money come;
"Naw, de river too foggy, de boat won't run."

Behind the Captain's back, he and his comrades speak a little more
frankly:

Well you kicked and stomped and beat me
An' you call that fun, sir;

But if I catch you in my home town,
Gonna make you run, sir.

Irony, satire and double entendre are always the weapons of
subject peoples and the working Negro is master of these devices.
Through all of these work songs there runs a theme of playful irony,
and although they are full of laughter, much of it is hearty and full-blooded;
much of it reflects the feeling of this verse:

If you see me laughin', I'm laughin' jes' to keep
from cryin'.
