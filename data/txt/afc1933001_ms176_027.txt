Dear Miss Muller:
Your letter has been referred to me by my chief,
Dr. Harold Spivacke, for comment. I am glad to learn of your
interest in the recordings made by Mrs Nicol Smith in Dutch
Guiana. These recordings are acoustically extremely fine and
represent certain exotic types of music which, I believe, were
hitherto unrecorded. Particularly interesting are samples of
musical "crossings" of Dutch, Negro, and [East Indian] music.
Duplicates of these records can be obtained from our
recording laboratories at a cost of $2.00 per double-sided
twelve-inch record. I feel sure that they will prove to be
useful in your work there. The Guiana records form only a small
part of our collection of field recordings, from the United States,
the West Indies and South America. I shall be delighted to be
of any further service I can.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
