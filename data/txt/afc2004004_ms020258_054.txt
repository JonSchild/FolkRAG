Georgia Sea Islands II A-3
TURKLE DOVE - Bessie Jones, lead

1)   Turkle dove done dropped his wings
      Turkle dove done dropped his wings
      The turkle dove done drooped his wings
      When on Zion Hill to sing:
CHORUS:
      Adam and Eve - do -do
      Adam and Eve - don't tell it to me
      Just meet me at the door - don't tell it to me
      There's SO-SO-LA-DO on SO-LA-SO-RE.
2)   My name is written on David's line (lyre)  (3)
      I'm goin' to heaven on the wheels of time. (chorus)
3)   O when I get to heaven I know the rule (3)
      I keep right down to the bathin' pool.  (chorus)
