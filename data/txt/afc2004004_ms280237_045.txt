p.6, M.Cox, 2.12.53
And t en they had old guns some places, and wire laid about.
You kicked agin this wire, you know, so the keepers heard it.
That'd go off, and thy'd know somebodywas in there. (Laughs)
T  y might have been in too, and ????????
I tell ya. If anybody got a gun, he could go before me, I wouldn't
say a whit? to 'im. Think what I should get(??) I should be the
same as them, if anybody come after me like that when I was
where I shouldn't be andit was night. I should be ? a bit?
That was a cowboystunt. (laughs) and laughs.) Why them traps they
used to be used, in years and years gone by, I don't know how
long ago, they used to be use.
Lo ax: Harry, give us this Van Damian'sland, and tel us what you know
about it.
Cox: I don't know anything about it at all. I can tell you the song,
if that would be of any use.

So come all you warrior lads?/We give you ? ? may be
I pray now pay attention
and listen unto me.

The fate of our poor transports
That you shall understand.
They had ships laid? to undergo, upon Van Damian's land.

My parents reared me tenderly, good learnin gave to me
Till I by bad co panions, beguiled my home from me.
I was brought upnear Worcestershire, near ? town did dwell
My name is Henry Herbert, and many knows me well.

Me and three more went out one night, tosquiredaniel's pond.
To get some game was our intent, as the night lay ? ing down.
But to our sad misfortune, they took us there with speed.
They sent us off to where we go, which made our hearts to bleed.

It wasat the March assizes, at the bar we did appear
Like Job we stood with patience, to hear our sentence there.
As them were old offenders, it made our case go hard,
Our sentence were for fourteen year, and we were sent on board.
