Michigan Water Blues

..........Tony Jackson, the greatest single-
handed entertainer, maybe the best the world has
ever seen. He enjoyed wearing the title of the 
World's Greatest Single-Handed Entertainer, playing
all classes of music in style they was supposed 
to be played in, from blues to opera, and he sung
one of these numbers, a blues he wrote himself -- The Michigan Waters
I'll show you the different types that he played it.

Yes, Michigan water tastes like sherry,
I mean sherry, crazy about my sherry,
Michigan water tastes like sherry wine,
Yes, Michigan water tastes like sherry wine.

Mama, Mama, look at sis,
She's out on the levee doin' the double twist,
Mama, Mama, please won't you look at sis,
She's out on the levee doin' the double twist.

She says, "Come in here, you dirty little sow, 
You tryin' to be a bad girl and you don't know
how."

She said "Touch my bonnet, touch my shawl,
But [don't] do not touch my waterfall,
Touch my bonnet, baby, touch my shawl,
Please don't you touch my waterfall."

Then he would do the single running bass. (Piano)

Then he'd do what [you] they call the double running bass.

Sounds like boogie.

(Piano)
