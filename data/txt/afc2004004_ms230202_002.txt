Dear Alan:

This is very nice material and I hope it will be
published somewhere, although it is too long for
an article.  Possibly you might send it to either
Ben Botkin, or to the Editor of the Journal of
Folklore, Dr. Wayland D. Hand, University of
California, Los Angeles, for their advice.  Perhaps
it could be cut, though not much.  Some
comment would be advisable describing how this
session came to be.  Occasionally it would seem
as if the participants had learned of some
notions about Negro songs, the idea of protest, 
etc.  The commentary might give some indication
as to their background; that these musicians
were no more fully unsophisticated individuals.

With all best wishes,
Sincerely,
George Herzog
