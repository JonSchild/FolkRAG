Reel #5, Song 1

ELEPHANT FAIR

I went down to the elephant fair
And the birds and the bees were there
And I went all around by the May post there
And them drug their snout on the ground.

Get the best, old lady,
Get the best, old man,
I love the black boy who totes the money,
Old lady,
Old man,
And the governor,
You can't stand.

Now, you Alabama sucker,
Take your hand offa me,
Take your hand offa me,
You better not mess with Lula,
I'll tell you the reason why,
She'll cut out your heart with a razor
And cut out your insides, too.

There is clapping throughout the chant.  On the last line, the
clapping gets faster and faster and dance steps are used.  The
dance is Jump for Joy.  Bessie Jones learned it at home and did
it when she was small.
