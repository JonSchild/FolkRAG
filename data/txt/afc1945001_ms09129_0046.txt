A soldier was reporting for a physical 
examination. He stepped up to the 
doctor, the doctor injected a needle in
his arm, drew in some blood, removed 
the needle, and put the blood in
the basin behind him. The soldier
stood and looked at him and asked, 
"Aren't you going to test it-"
The doctor turned and answered-
"Blood came out didn't it? "  - "Next"
