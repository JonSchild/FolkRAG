[so I had] so they kep' a worrin' me so bad I had to do sumpin' or other jus' to make 'em break up, Tha's all.  So I made 'em
breakup [them]theyselves.  So.  They wouldn't hit one another.

[*passage omitted about 2 boys tied together*]

AL:  What did...when you were a lil'...what's the first thing you
remember[;] the very first thing you remember? [From]In your childhood?
BJ:  The very first thing I can  think of was [the]a sawmill.  An'
to my mem'ry...an' Mama says she didn' know that I could 'member
that.  She says she often ask me, did I 'member that or did some one
tell me.  But I 'member [.]it [I 'member it.]  It was a sawmill down below
the house where we stayed at , an' I used to be on the [foot (?],
porch, cause I had to stay by myself, you know, while they worked.
[*Bess (1) walked*]
They would come back an' forth to the house to see about me, you
know.  An ah, until, some time they see somebody sick, you know,
an' jus' sittin' aroun', then they let me stay with them.  Sumpin' like
that, you know?  But people had to work in those days, you know.
They couldn't -- like they carry the children to the fiel's an'
things.  So they would leave me home, an' ah, that's [how] where they found
out I was walkin'.  They found I was walkin', no tellin' how long
I been walkin', you know?  Mama said she put food on the table an'
they'd come back an' it would be I'd went and got it.  But yet, still, I was
walkin' around then.
[*sawmill*]
     But the first thing I can remember was that saw mill.  It go
yeahah.  Down [there over] below the house, you know.  Ol' funny mill
like that befo' they work on.  An' I would tell that mill [(hurts,
hers, ?], "Hush that mockin' Aa"  I used to call my mama [Ah Ah]
Aa; her name's Abby an' I used to call her Aa, you know I thought
it's mockin' Aa.  Mama used to sing a whole lot, ya know, an' I
said to that thing, "Hush that mockin' Aa!"  I can remember that
jus' as good, jus' settin' on the porch, "Hush that mockin' Aa!"
[*1st MEMORY -2*]
Ha, ha.  I used to tell that ol' sawmill, it was a-mockin' Ah.  I 
say tha's the first thing I can really can remember.  An' the first
[*friends*][peoples] pup, you know, all from home.  They was Miss Lizzy Wright, an',
ah, yeah, Lizzy Wright, Carrie Wright, tha's who it was.  An, ah, 
her husban' that was Charlie Wright.  I remember [them]there an' the little
girl that used to come to play with me, come up there some time.
She was, she was half white, y'know, her name was Bullis (sic).
