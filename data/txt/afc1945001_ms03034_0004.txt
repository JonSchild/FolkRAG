Dear Mr. Cane:

Professor Allport, chairman of the advisory board of this division, has suggested that I write you concerning a charge, no doubt false, which is being made against the Jewish people.  Even since Pearl Harbor, the rumors have been that the Jewish boys are managing to excape the draft.  There are many versions of this, that they are taking pills which depress their heart rate, that they take sugar injections and are rejected for diabetic symptoms, that they are bribing Jewish physicians on draft boards, etc.

Since this is one of the most widespread and vicious of the anti-semetic stories, I think it deserves your attention.  Is it possible that you would be able to provide us with figures which could clearly disprove these rumors? Lacking that, could you send us figures on Jewish enlistments in the last war and other such material?

It is my opinion that this story, in its several elaborations is the most widely spread anti-semetic story in this region.  I hope very much that somehow it may be discredited.

Cordially yours,
[*R. H. Knapp.*]
Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
