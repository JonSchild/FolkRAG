Mr. John A. Lomax
1618 Avenue Y
Lubbock, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you so much for your letter of October 15 and for the
list of records which were sent to New York.

In regard to the WPA, it is not my intention really to lean
on them at all. I am just striving to obtain for the Archive
recognition as the center of folk song activity in this country.
As you know, Seeger is now with the Federal Music Project, Botkin
with the Federal Writers Project, and Halpert and Herzog with the
Federal Theater Project. I do not want their folk song activities
to run away from us. I have made it clear to each one of them
that we cannot give any "blanket" promises of aid but shall consider
each specific instance separately. As a matter of fact the
Federal Writers Project seems to be doing folkloristic work in
Arizona and neighboring states and I suggested to them that if
their representatives in these states could prepare a good list
of informants we might then be able to arrange for you to record
the cowboy music and other material which they may have found. As
soon as anything materializes, I shall communicate with you again.

With kindest regards to all,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
