F. N. Female

In a flying field in England, the commander was preparing
to send the pilots out to deliver or throw pamphlets over Germany.
He was short of one pilot. There was a colored boy who worked
on the ground crew. He was very reliable and the commander
decided to send him out. The American commander objected
saying that the colored people were not dependable. After much
argument the British commander sent the colored boy. That 
evening all of the planes returned except the one which the
colored boy flew. The American commander immediately said
"I told you so" to the British officer. Two days passed and
the plane did not return. The British officer had not
lost faith in the boy. Late that evening the boy flew in
and on being asked why the delay, stated that he thought
orders were to deliver them door to door in person.

Hitler and Goering were out during one day when
they killed a dog. Hitler told Goering to go in and tell
the master that the dog was dead. Goering went in and
said, "Hiel Hitler, the dog is dead." The man immediately
bestowed gifts of food on the German officer.
