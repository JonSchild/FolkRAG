sophomore Female Negro

there were two white soldiers in a camp with
a Chinese soldier; every nite the white soldier
would put rocks, gravel, and dirt in the
[Chink] Chinese soldier's bed and shoes.
This joke went on for some [U] time with out
any complaints from the Chink seeing that
he wasn't bothered with their joking the Whites
went up to him one day and said that they wouldn't
put rock gravel or dirt in his bed any more
"oh no" replied the Chinaman "well me no
piss in coffee no more."
