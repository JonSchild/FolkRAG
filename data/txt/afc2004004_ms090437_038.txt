Fisk.  13.   9 STARK

'Twas noble, brave, indeed."
There he lies, say the captain'
And turned away to hide his fear.
The general quickly in that moment knelt down by his side,
Then gave a cry that teched all hearts that day --
"My son, my brave young hero."
I thought him safe at home
Forgive me, father, fore I run away

Cho

And break the news to Mother.
She knows how dear I love her.
And tell her not to wait for me;
I'm not going home.
She knows there is no other
Can take the place of Mother.
And kiss her dear sweet lips for me
And break the news to her."

That was about 1914.  That was a song back from the Spanish-American
War, too.
A:  What kind of song do you call it?
S:  I wouldn't know; the subject is Break the News to Mother.
A:  Was that a favorite song of yours?
S:  Yes
A:  Why did you like it so much?
S:  Well, I like it on on one account - of a soldier -- he run off
from home - his father thought he was at home - his father was 
a general and he had slipped off & was in the war and he was the bravest one
Was in there after the flag was shot down and the captain asked who would
save it, and he went and saved it, brought the flag back, but he got killed.  Then when the
general come to see who it was, he found out 'twas his son and all he
asked him to do was to break the news to his Mother.
A:  Was he a Negro or a white man?
S:  I don't know (apologetic laughter).

Hurry, girls and boys,
Don't you say a word.
I'm gonna sing you a new song now
That you haven't never heard.
