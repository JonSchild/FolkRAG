MRS. DAVIS:
He was trying to tell you how long it took to get up in the world.
LARRY:
Thats what he was trying to tell me. And I looked down at his hands you know and he was rubbing his legs and I could see how his pants had got thin, you know. But his telling me that gave me courage. And what I wanted to ask you was, at that time with Rev. Davis it was hard for you too, I mean to make ends meet any kind of way.
MRS. DAVIS:
Oh, yes it was hard. Yes it was, it was hard to make ends meet but when he was at 69th Street I used to go out and work a lot of times, you know and he would be away, sometimes he would be away to Harlem and stay sometimes with Tiny around you know.
LARRY:
What kind of work did you have, what kind of work did you do.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well I would do Domestic work. Sometimes I'd go out and ------------- down on 42nd street.
LARRY:
I know them parlors were fine cause some of your cooking, I know about your cooking. Rev Davis was up in the Bronx the day you make those Chitlins. Me and Brother Davis just ate Chitlins we don't want nothing else.
