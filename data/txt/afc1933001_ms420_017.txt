MARCH OF THE PEOPLE

Oh what is the sound and rumor? What is this that all men hear?
Like the wind in hollow valleys when the storm is drawing near,
Like the rolling-on of ocean in the eventide of fear?
'Tis the people marching on.
Hark, the rolling of the thunder!
Lo! the sun, and lo! therunder
Riseth faith and hope and wonder;
The Right comes marching on!

These are they who build thy houses, weave thy raiment, win thy wheat,
Smooth the rugged, fill the barren, turn the bitter into sweet,
All for thee this day, and ever. What reward for them is meet?
As the host comes marching on?

Ye tyrants hear and tremble! for with words the sounds is rife.
Once for you and death we labored; changed henceforward is the strife.
We are men and we shall battle for the world of men and life,
Our host is marching on!

On we march then, we the people, and the rumor that ye hear
Is the blended sound of battle and deliverance drawing near;
For the hope of ev'ry creature is the banner that we rear,
The world is marching on! (battle Hymn of the Republic) from Levermore


Jewish National Anthem

Lift thine eyes, for now the day
Breaks through the darkling clouds of night.
Fearful shadows fade away.
Lo! all the earth is filled with light.
Oh my hear, have no dismay.
Boldly take your onward way;
In the east the light is shining
There, out of darkness, springs the day,

When along a weary road
Sadly we go and bowed with care
Blessed Hope with gentle wing[s]
Lifts aloft to realms more fair.
Oh my heart, etc.

This has a tremendous swing to
it and should be fine for congregational
singing, My kids in the west like it
so well they demanded to bring their
parents in to learn it too. We used
these same words; but it seems to me
they could be changed to advantage.
The idea of struggle seems to 'take'
among all sorts of people.
