Sec: I'll say, mister, you and 28 others are being sued by someone in Missouri representing someone in Arizona for exactly 500,000 dollars - If you'll come to court at the time
Boss: But that's a half a million dollars - that's a lot of money for a song.
Sec: Am I arguing?  See you in court.  Goodbye.
(Receivers up)
Boss: Get me my hat.  Half a million!  There isn't that much money -
Steno: Where'll we be able to find you?
Boss: I'm going to the music publishers protective association - They'll know something about this, I hope.
Steno: What's it all about, Margy?
Margy: Oh it seems somebody wrote Home on the Range so it isn't a folk song and no one can use it.
Steno: I always wondered where they got that song.
(Sound knock on the door)
Boss: Mr. Paine?  I hope you aren't too busy but I've just received a summons for having Home on the Range played over our station - 
Paine: You too.  Looks as though they're suing everybody in the country.  Well, there's only one way to settle whether or not this fellow wrote it so we're going to track down that song - Our attorney has gone to Kansas or some such place - it's quite a tangle.  Mr. Lomax here were the first to include it in a collection.
Boss: How do you do, Mr. Lomax?
