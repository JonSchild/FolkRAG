Dear Mrs. Buchanan:

Thanks for the kind letter about the festival.
As it turned out, I wasn't able to go, but I certainly
hope to see the festival next year at least.

I look forward to the publication of your new book with
especial pleasure that one always reserves for your work.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
