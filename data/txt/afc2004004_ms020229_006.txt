BJ TAPE 15, p.3

AL: Why on earth are women so proud of their long hair?
BJ: Why, I don' know...Proud of it if it ain't long, ha-ha. But, 
ah, it's just they glory, I suppose. You know, for them to... 
the Lord says so. I mean if the Lord fix [ya] it that way, maybe. 
There's sumpin' -- Got to have sumpin' or other to be proud of 
'bout theirself, hah! Ha, ha, ha. I guess that what it is.
 'Cause they say a woman has her glory, an' a woman is man's
glory.
    So, I, I was tellin' the peoples, I said, "Well, if all men 
treat their women like I treat my hair, they'd be in bad condition."
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Huh. Huh! 'Cause sometime I don't
care anything about worrin' with it, or botherin' with it at all. 
Um-huh!
AL: But you must have felt very bad when you lost it. 
BJ: I sure did, uh-huh... I felt very bad...
AL: Did you cry, or did you...?
BJ: Huh? No-o...No...No use cry about spilt milk. But I was
 jus' so glad to git over it myself, you don't know how I felt. 
And, uh, seemed like it took a whole lot a              from me. 
A long time, that gas there. So I just burnt. Nobody didn't 
know anything about it for a long time 'bout how I feel. Hot! 
Jus' for a long time. 
TL: What's this?
BJ: That's when I wa' tellin ya about that gas blowed my
hair up; blowed up on me. The gas stove. I tol' ya about it. 
The gas stove blowed up. It sho' set ya afire. I though about 
it to myself: This must be the way peoples burn in hell. My skin 
was burnin' without any flame[s]. Just burnin'!
