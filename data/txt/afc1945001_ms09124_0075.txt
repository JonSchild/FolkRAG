Period 
Current War Rumors
1.  From our usual reliable source 
in Berlin we hear that one of Berlin's 
radio announcers a few days ago 
interrupted one of the Fuehrer's addresses
 to say: "Ladies and gentlemen we 
regret that we are unable to continue
 Der Fuehrer's most glorious address
 because one of the radio tubes just hieled! 
 Pfff[?], hieled! Pfff[?], in Der Fuehrer's face"!
2.   The Berlin radio complains of a new 
form of sabotage in occupied countries.
 When axis ships are in port, saboteurs
 sneak onto the piers, and bulls-eyes on the 
ships so they will be better targets for
 U.S. and British subs.
 3. From Berlin we hear that Hitler
 is dead or dying.
4.  We hear that Japan is building 
a fleet of glass bottomed boats to review 
the latest thing in Japanese fashions -
 sunken navies!
