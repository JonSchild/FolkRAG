Earl Hines-1 

Now I'll tell you  [how Earl Hines,] about Earl Hines, who is supposed
to be so good but is really a fake pianist, [came to be in Chicago]?.
Earl Hines originated in Pittsburgh, the home town of a very
good friend of mine, Harry Collins. Harry arrived in Chicago
from Pittsburgh in the year 1925x and made up his mind to start 
a new cabaret on the site of the old Elite on State Street.
Harry had been a friend of mine due to the fact that he liked music
and that my friendship is very easy to be gained. He used to
tell me about his plans and we discussed the shortage of good
piano players in Chicago.

I couldn't work for him because I was then connected with 
the Melrose Music Company and had a lot of work to do -- managing
the business, teaching Melrose about the business, arranging music, 
writing, proof reading, eliminating
the palookas and seeing that all the bands got good tunes to play.

[I was often tired. reading music,
playing pool and looking for spots on cards under bright lights
my eyes was shot.]

Harry told me he knew a man for his job. "I know you're
supposed to be the best in this country, but this man is good. "I
said Harry couldn't rest until I heard this man, so he
said, "If this man is good, send for him." sent for
He wanted me to see for myself how good he was
Earl Hines from Pittsburgh
Earl was very meek and easy to get along with at that time. He 
said he had heard a lot about me and I said I was sorry I could
not say the same. Then Harry asked me to supply him with the tunes,
such as Wolverine Blues, Milenburg, and The Pearls, because Harry 
knew if you couldn't play those tunes, you might as well quit
