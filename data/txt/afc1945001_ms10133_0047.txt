Oh, Mr. Blank, The Civil Service Authorities are looking for you.
Say, Bob, why don't you join the [Marine] Navy I hear that it's
lots of fun. Why  join the [Marine] Navy when the highest a 
colored boy can [go is] be promoted is second mess boy.

As a ship was sinking with [seve] one boy on 
board, I heard him say to himself, Is this what I am
fighting for?

After some colored soldiers had had a riot
down in Georgia, I was standing around as they
loaded them into the truck and took them to [be]
their commanding officer. One of the colored
soldiers who were standing around remarked
and said, "So this is what we are fighting for 
A man can't even speak his own opinion these 
days without an officer walking over and 
knocking a man down which causes a riot.  

A young boy walked in the [stone] store & 
asked to buy some [Grapefruit Juice] tomato soup where 
upon he was [stole] told that [it] it was frozen.  
He replied innocently "That's allright 
Madam, I'll warm it."
