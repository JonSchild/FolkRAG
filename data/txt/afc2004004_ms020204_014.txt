[* Reel 8, page 5. *] 
just about the time they say, "That's all, we'll stand." And so Evbody
stand gettin ready to dismiss, maybe two or three will run
offa that bench-- maybe two three those mourners just break aloose and run offa there and 
begin to talk about religion-- "Thank God. .  So Glad. .  Got
religion. . Just as sho as you born. .  Everybody in church then 
gon go to lookin and runnin over to where they is and when
they find out who they is they just go to shoutnin and hollin
and goin on.  Cause I know how I did myself when mama's
cousin got religion.  But she got  it at twelve o'clock
that day. 
They have a prayer meetin at twelve o'clock every day 
there, too. And she got religion at  twelve.  And I was just
getin out there and I heard her when she hollered out in there
I thought it was her and I run to the door [and] to see and
it was her..O Lawd,  if we didn't have a time.  Um-mm-ump! We
she did have a good time. Sho was. 
The preacher was n't there.  He don't be there at
tweelve.  It 's just some of the mebers and deacons meet there 
and have a little prayer meetin round twelve o'clock every
day.  That's to keep the mourners basedd, just to keep them knowin
that the meetin is goin on and they don't have no idleness thu
the day. Pray just as hard today as you do tonight--the pastor 
told um to do like that-- because if you let um go all day
long, they'll see something cross their mind and they won't pray.
Keep a little meetin long at twelve o'clock, let um know that 
they must pray to get religion.
A:  Well, that was your daughters?
V:  No that was my mother's sister's daughter? My first cousin(6160)
