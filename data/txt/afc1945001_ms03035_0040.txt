navigation company, listed for us rumors reaching her from August 4-8 as
follows:
1. It seems only logical that the United States will lose
this war since it is doing absolutely nothing beyond movements of a [*3*]
defensive character. The Army realizes this and is seriously thinking
of impeaching the Commander-in-Chief. August 4.
2. William J. Cameron, of the Ford Motor Company, is a Nazi
sympathizer. He has spoken at a number of large gatherings and the text [*3*]
of his talks has not been made public for this reason. August 4.
3. The Japanese have been organizing the Negroes in the United [*5*]
States for years and this government should have realized the fact long
ago. August 5.
4. One of the President's sons is missing but no public mention
of the fact has been made because of the effect it might have on United [*3*]
Nations morale. August 6.
5. Henry Ford and George Washington Carver are both Fifth
Columnists and Mr. Ford has moved Carver to Dearborn so he will be free [*3*]
to experiment with explosives for the Nazis without a lot of nosey people
bothering him or hampering his progress. August 6.
