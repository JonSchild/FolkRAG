Joe Savage (singing:)
John Henry he had a little wife,
And her name was Polly Anne.
John Henry taken sick,
And he had to go to bed.
Polly drove that steel like a man,
Lordy, Oh!
Polly drove that steel like a man.
Walter Brown:
Let im sing that other verse for you.
(W. Brown joins in the song:)

And the dress she wore was red.
And they asked her, well,
Was she on her way?
She said, "I'm goin where my man fell dead,
I'm goin where my man fell dead."
(Joe Savage singing:)
John Henry told his Captain.
He said, "My Captain, well you goin downtown?"
Will you bring me back a twenty-pound mall?",
