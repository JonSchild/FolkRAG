Rumor Report

Attached you will find special Intelligence Report, dated
9/30/42, subject - Rumors.

Perhaps no single subject has engaged the fancy and the
attention of more information men in the government than rumors.
In fact, the study of rumors has itself been the subject of rumors.

This first Bureau of Intelligence canvass of the subject
will, we feel, put an end to a good many half-truths which have been
circulated among us about rumor and, more important, will indicate
certain directions in which positive work can be done to neutralize
rumors.

One additional thing this study makes plain: "Don't talk"
and "don't rumor" are quite different as informational themes.  Careless 
talking may give valuable information to the enemy.  Careless
rumor mongering, this study shows, isn't calculated so frequently to
give valuable information to the enemy.  Its danger lies in its harmful 
effects on Americans themselves.

It seems to us that the material embodied in this report
may suggest to the Press Bureau certain treatments of the subject of
rumor, such as Sunday feature articles, cartoon treatment shaming 
rumor mongers and, in addition, perhaps tips to columnists (who are
notorious spreaders of rumors) that their knack for insinuation may
sometimes set in motion a rumor epidemic with damaging results.  The
people in your Bureau, of course, will have better ideas about the
application of this material to press uses than we can suggest.
