Dear Alan:

Here are two letters which came recently for you.
We have answered that portion of Max Jones' letter referring 
to Jelly Roll and have also written to Hugo Macbeth,
the attorney for the estate, in an attempt to clear up the 
matter.

I enjoyed your Spokane program about as well as any 
in the series and liked the way you handled Woody Guthrie's 
song. We recorded 10 songs by the Priority Ramblers this 
week and they came out very well as you may hear from Tom
and Jackie. We are also hoping to record Edna Nells' folk
songs. A project has been written up for Pappy and I hope it 
goes through. We are making reasonable progress with the
albums. I am also putting the finishing touches on my book.

I hope we will be seeing you soon. With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
