Michigan   Detroit  Reported by Dr. Robert S. Gregory, Dearborn
                                  Four dentists, Henry Ford Hospital

Rumor: A dental supply salesman informs me that work is being passed around 
that the war is apt to end abruptly and at any moment.  This opinion 
is mounting, he says, and being favorably received by an increasing number of people, whereas a few months ago most people were being reconciled to a continuance of the war for two to five years longer.  
Origin of this opinion would be hard to trace, but "similar sentiment seems to be entertained abroad as well as at home."
