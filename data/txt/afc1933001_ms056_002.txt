Port Aransas, Texas,
3/4/1939.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Can you estimate
 approximately, when you will
be able to ship the machine to 
me?   Several of my correspondents 
are enquiring about the dates on 
which they may expect me. It 
would simplify my problems 
to be able to name some probable
time.
I dislike to add one burden 
to an overworked man.
If there is nothing to say at
the moment, file this letter in
the "archives of gravity."
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
