DIRECTIONS
[*[*]Since this is part of a larger investigation in which all should proceed alike,
please read the following directions exactly as given.[*]*]
"We have been asked to cooperate in an investigation of what passes by word of mouth 
about the War--things which often fail to appear in print. The investigation is being
made by a friend of mine for a War Agency. What we are asked to do is to write down five
jokes, anecdotes, puns, rhimes or "cracks" about the War.
Please use the paper I am passing out--one sheet apiece. [*[*]Ordinary typewriter paper.[*]*]
We are asked not to write our names but to indicate the class in High School (or College)
Freshman, Sophomore, Junior or Senior, and to indicate also our race and sex. Will you
please write in a box at the top of the page: High School (or College) Freshman, or
High School (or College) Junior or whatever class you are in followed by the word Negro.
[*[*]Illustrate on board,[*]*] and either Male or Female.
To insure your frankness, I shall not read any of the papers nor will anyone else here,
so you may be sure you will not be personally identified. In fact, as soon as the papers
are handed in I shall seal them up in this envelope and mail them. Please do not put your
name on the papers.
Now what kind of stories or "cracks" should we write? Any kind of story, joke, pun,
toast, or jingle about the War. The limit is five. Choose the five which most impress
you [*[*] the underlined words slowly and emphatically,[*]*] which you have heard, not seen in
print or picture (or, if you have both heard and seen it, which you have heard first).
story may be impressive for any number of reasons: because you like it, or because you
don't like it, because it is amusing, because it is true, because it is unfair, etc., or
any combination of these and other reasons. Some of the cracks may be pretty raw, but if
a pretty indecent joke has forced itself on your attention it may be one of those which
impress us most and should go in. We should not try to make the list pleasant nor unpleasant--
just what has impressed us most for any reason whatever. Five is the limit and
by thinking a little we can all remember that many. If you can't remember the exact words
of a little poem or jingle, give it as near as you can. Please write these down now--let's
not take too long over it."
