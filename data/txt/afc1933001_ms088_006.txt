The University of Texas
AUSTIN
DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH       November 6, 1941

Dear John Lomax:
I enjoyed and agreed with your note of advice when it came a month
ago, and several week's observation has convinced me even more of
the soundness of your interpretation of affairs in the English
Department. (I haven't had even a glimpse of what goes on in the
University as a whole.) I am thinking of my year here primarily as
a sort of traveling scholarship, a chance to get on with certain
projects in a library far beyond anything else in the South or
Southwest. To this end Eleanor and I reconcile ourselves to leaving
our house and our friends. And of course we do know some very fine
people here.
As nearly as I can tell. the departmental political pot is not
simmering very hard just now. Philip Graham, the new chairman, is
an able and just man, and I think all factions are forced to approve
of his administration: although he is closer to Dobie than to the
other side. My own work is highly pleasant, and as far as may be
in the midst of universal chaos we are settled for a profitable
winter.
All of us are looking forward to the new book: Gladys Sharp told
me recently that it had been postponed again. When you write Alan,
let him know that the session at our house in Dallas after his
concert remains in our memory and in the memories of our friends as
the high point of last year. I look forward to a repetition when
we are again established in Dallas.
Cordially yours,
Henry Nash Smith

Why don't you, once in while,
send me some item that would
flatter my vanity as this ought to
flatter yours?
Lovingly,
Father.
