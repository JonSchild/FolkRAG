Dear Alan :

1. It is no longer necessary to address
your letters in care of the Bank.
You might tell Miss Rogers also.
Miss Terrill and I are really
living in our old home, mainly
according to her plans, to create
a pleasant and comfortable place
for the children to come back to,
whenever they can spare the time
and have the inclination.

2. As for my "bloated capitalism",
I wonder if you have realized
that your income for the present
six months is far larger than
mine? I am selling some of
my securities to keep Bass in
