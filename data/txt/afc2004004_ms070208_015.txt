During high water - 
Watchmen have to look for seep boils -

 on the other side - If seep boil is 
clear, no danger. If muddy - dangerous,
W'd build a [tub] ring of sacks and let the
pressure equalize[ing] it and draw off the

When C. A. came in they averaged 8

Put up 7 miles of levee in 1932, 3 & 4
7 million cubic yards of dirt -

it up over the wheeler wheel and throw it in and make 
them dump over it - buried a many a one just that 
way up and down the levee -
