When Mrs. McMahons Mother was a
girl she & some other girls went raspberrying
in a cutting in the woods. She was singing
when some young men came into the
clearing to berrie. One of the young men
listened, then said, "I'm going to marry
that girl, she sings beautiful." And
in due time he did.  Hastily
and Sincerely, Mrs. Chester E. Lamb.

You'll
have
to push
Mrs. Mc
a little.
She is
modest.
