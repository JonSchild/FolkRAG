One time I brought my wife, too, didn't I? That was only jest that 
one time, wadn't it? You ast me whethah I bring anybody else. 
I don't carry nobody wid me.
(Do you usually go places with your wife?)
Some time. When I want to carry huh with me. Some time 
I go with huh.
(Do you go to church with her?)
Some time. If I ain't got nowhere else to go.
(Rev. Davis, what do you do with your money?)

(Does she spend it up for you?)
Well. . . . She don't throw nothin away. I think that 
what a man ought to do wid his money, you understan, to take care 
of huh. Thass right.Is that wrong?
(No. Not if she can be trusted.)
She's in the place of it. Whether she be trusted or 
no, she's in that place.
(So you have to give it to her, whether you trust her 
or not?)
Yeah. She's in the place of it.
(Could you trust your first wife with money?)
Naw. . . I never though I could trust her. I'd keep it 
to mysef.
(And what would you do with it?)
Keep it.
(Keep it.But where?)
Well! It would be in a secret place somewhere where I 
could git it.
(That nobody knew about but you ?)
