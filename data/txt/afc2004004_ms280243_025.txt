TAPE 97: CAPTAIN RASMUSSEN:
R:  I was never more shocked in all my life than as when on one
occasion I heard sailors' shanteys sung by a so-called shanty-choir
on the BBC - a sea program at that. Well, in the first place
they had completely forgotten that shanties were entirely working-songs
with a tempo of their own, and a tempo that would fit in
with the kind of work they were doing. There were slow-march
shanties, hand-over-hand shanties, and evertything. The tempo of
those shanties naturally depended on the tempo at which the work
was done. Well, to quote an example, a very glaring one -- that
very old Shantey - Amsterdam. That was sung like this. . . . .
(He demonstrates how choir sang it). . . .Now - the actual tempo
of that shantey was governed by the tempo of the men working
round a capstan, hauling up a damn big heavy anchor and a very,
very heavy chain. Naturally you can't prance around and do that
sort of thing. It was done in a slow march. To get a picture of
it - these tough old sailors with their chests against the capstan
bar - a great big, six-foot long oaken bar, and very heavy,
straining every muscle. . . .And you hear the tramp of their feet
and then they start the shantey. . .
In Amsterdam there lived a maid,
O hearken to my lay,
In Amsterdam there lived a maid And she was mistress of her trade,
I'll go no more a-roving with you fair maid.

I put my hand upon her breast
And the wind from her oars blew West-Sou'-West.

I put my hand upon her knee.
Said she, "Young man, you're rather free."

I put my hand upon her thigh.
She said, "Young man take your hand away."

And then I sailed into her box
And got a bloody dose of pox.

Lomax:  What about the "Flying Fish" one?
Ras: O that's another one. We used to sing it like this. There
was nothing naughty about them except the rhymes.
1) I'm a flying fish sailor bound out for Hong Kong,
And away-ay, blow the man down,
Just listen to my  tale it'll not take you long,
Give us some time to blow theman down.
