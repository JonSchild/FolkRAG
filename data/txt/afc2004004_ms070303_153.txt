That's why I Iike to use a stand
Pipe Major Ross was the first to use 
the stand - now I've told all the 
piper's to use the stand and they're
all doing it.

 These little graces [use are wather?] should be
of the unconcious - if you have to
think to put them in they sound
labored. A lot of the songs
that have been written, well
it seems wooden compared to
the natural singing. If you're
conscious it spoils the thing to
some extent....
