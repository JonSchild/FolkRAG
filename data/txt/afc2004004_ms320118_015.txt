Dion:  Well, let's say there was a place where a fella had a
couple daughters or a son, you know.  He would invite all his
friends around there, maybe forty, and he'd come see about
music and we'd go down there and play for him.  And throw
a party in the house, and it was very nice.  Most of the
people [that] knew each other, they were neighbors.  And then
they started building dance halls.
AL:  What if a stranger came to one of those parties?
Dion:  If he wasn't invited in those days, they wouldn't
accept him, because if he was a stranger. . . .the old guys were
very particular about the people who come in to visit their
family.  They were different.
AL:  I was told when I was running around this country about
1930 that if I would just go to a dance that I might get my
tires punctured. . . . . .
Dion:  Those were rough years, I remember.  I remember we play
a dance and they had these bullies at different places, they
would make you leave the dances.  They'd start fights, an
stuff like this.  We played at one place, we came over there
and they made us leave.  But one of my friends and me, we got
our daddy's pistol and put it in our pocket.  Next time we
went and they wanted us to leave, we got the gun out, and they
left.  They came on us with a big knife about that long.  Say
you all going to leave, or we gonna make you leave.  Just open
and when he saw that gun, said I wa s just joking.  But if
you wouldn't have had that gun, [t?] you'd have had to leave
