Report #6 - Study of Rumors in Chicago Area -
August 3 to August 8

Attached is Report No. 6 for the Bureau of
Intelligence entitled "Study of Rumors in Chicago Area -
August 3 to August 8."

I have not been able to spend as much time 
as I wanted to on this report as practically all my time 
has been devoted to pressing matters pertinent to our
moving, and so forth.

However, through the media of groups and
organizations that are close to this particular subject
and the splendid cooperation I have been able to solicit
from them, I am confident this will give you a good
over-all picture of the current rumors which were uttered 
in Chicago and surrounding area during the past week.
