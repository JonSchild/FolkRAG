Dear Professor Winslow:

In the course of the preparation of the second volume
of "American Ballads and Folk Songs" I have encountered your
interesting "American Broadside Verse", and in it I discovered
the broadside of a hymn composed by the Reverend Mr. Whitefield
to be sung over his own corpse.  I recorded a fine variant
of this elegy in Kentucky last fall from the singing of a 
mountaineer and his wife, and I plan to use this hymn in the 
section of white spirituals. 

I should like to print the broadside of the same hymn
which appears on page 51 of your book, side by side, with the 
variant I have recorded in Kentucky. I hope you will be able 
to give me permission to do this.  I should appreciate an 
early reply to this request. 

Sincerely yours, 

John A. Lomax
