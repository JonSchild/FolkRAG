Conversation between two federal employees:
"I believe that the Negroes in India have been exploited
for many years by powerful and wealthy firms in England. We all
know that the English Government has condoned mistreatment of
people in their possessions for centuries. These English firms
exploit the poor for all they are worth. It seems that India
is telling them where to head in at now and England has finally
come to a point where she must pay for her sins. Just compare
the loyalty of the Filipinos with the loyalty of the people of
India. The United States always treated the Filipinos as they
should be treated and if England could truthfully make the same
statement perhaps she would be in a better position to secure
your cooperation. In my opinion the proud British Empire is a
thing of the past. If they intend to keep Japan from taking India
they had better give India what she wants."  [*8-7*]  [*24*]
