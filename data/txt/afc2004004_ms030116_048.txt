Eliz: With a godly love?
Rev. D: Thass right. I don't want no fresh lips flirtin round me atall.
I tell em I say, "Lissun --"
Johnny: Smartest thing you ever did.
Mrs. D: Yes. Because they'll do it.
Rev. D: Thass right.
Eliz: I guess [xxxx] lots of them are lonely.
Rev. D: All ministers are not like that. They're jes easy to catch as a 
catch-fish when he's hongry.
Johnny: That's what they are. Cat-fish out feedin. See, you can catch a
cat-fish when he's out feedin. When [xx] big fish feed it's best for minnows
to stay under a rock.
Rev. D: It takes a man that is well in age an filled with the Holy Ghost to 
be kep in a world like this anyhow. This ain't the fust time I've talked 
with you bout that. I never did believe in no young preachers goin up 
against a world like this. Mr. Johnny, I ain't lying bout that. Well, someone
say, the same Holy Ghost that keep a ole man keep a young one. I'm satisfied
[xxxxxxxxxxxx] of that. It's true. But heah one thing I want you to onderstand
is this: We're kep by the Holy Ghost if we let the Holy Ghost keep us. 
Johnny: Amen.
Rev. D: You heah what I say? You'll take care of your wife if she lets you.
Ain't that right, Brother?
Johnny: That's right.
Rev. D: Huh?
Johnny: That's true.
Rev. D: Well if she don't stay with you to let you take care of her -- then
what? Huh? Is that it or is it not?
Johnny: That's got it.
Rev. D: That's correct. You stay wid huh if she lets you stay. But if she 
raise so much hell you can't stay -- Huh?
