Delia gone
Jonie he shot delia.
On a Saturday night.
She curse him a wicked curse.
And he promises to take her life
Chors
Delia gone one ?nosi sound. Delia gone.

On monday he was arrested
On tuesday he was tried
The jurymen brought him guilty.
His sentence was to die.
Chors
Delia gone one more round delia gone.

Jailer oh jailer how can I sleep.
When all around my bed at night
Does little delia peep.
Delia gone one more sound delia gone

They send for her mother she was dressed in black
She cried all day she cried all night
But couldent bring delia back.
Delia gone one more round delia gone

He went down to the graveyard, to se delia lie down.
Delia gone one more round delia gone.
