of blue.
Of course all sailing was not smooth;
T'was soon he came to learn.
For war broke out-
And he was there-
And he would have his turn-
To use the gun-and shoot the fang,
That dare step in our ranks,
And try to kill for reasons none-
Yes, they'd pay for their pranks!

Of course the war was heavy,
And rich young blood was shed;
But with hearts like lads,
Those boys that died-
To us shall ne'er be dead.

Yes, lad lived on to victory's end;
With many dreams in view,
He did his work,-
And did it well;
For still unfurled, "Red, White, and Blue."
