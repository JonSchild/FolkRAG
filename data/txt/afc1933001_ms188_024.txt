Mr. Alan Lomax 
Office of War Information 
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Lomax: 
I have your letter of November 2 advising me that you 
have asked Mr. Boatright to send you a copy of the thesis 
on Czech Folk-Lore in order that you may check it in connection
with the project of Mrs. Jakobson. I will be glad to 
keep in mind Mrs. Jakobson and her project and be of such 
assistance as I can. 

Sincerely yours, 
Homer P. Rainey, President
