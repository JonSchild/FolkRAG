But the marchants o' Yarmouth, when they heard so,
Said, "Come, brother sailor, to church let us go.
And there we will build a most beautiful pile,
In remembrance of Nelson, the hero of the Nile."

Rule Britannia, Britannia ruled the waves,
Britons never, never, never shall be slaves.

That's how that go.

Kennedy: Does it go on after that?
Cox: Yes. I know a bit more of it yet.
"Your plans," said Britannia, "were excellent an' good, (pause)
A monument for Lord Nelson, an' a sword for Collinwood.
Let it be of good marble, (pause) an' 'petuate his name.

Our soldiers an' sailors, as I have been told,
Keep themselves in readiness the right for to hold,
Their cause to maintain - their rights to maintain, their cause to export,

If any invasion, to save British port.

Our soldiers an' sailors many brave deeds have done
While fightin' in foreign, many battles have won.
If the Nile could but speak or Trafalgar declare,
All the world with Lord Nelson they would not compare.

Rule Britannia. . . (laughs)

You never hear that afore?
D. Kennedy: It's lovely, isn't it?
Kennedy: No, I never heard that one before.
Cox: No?
Kennedy: Have you really heard that on Country Magazine?
Cox: Yeah. It come from me.
Kennedy: Came from you?
Cox: O' course it did.
Kennedy: Collinson got it from you?
Cox: Yeah. He got it an' they - they took it an' sung it, I think.
