NATIONAL DEFENSE SONG
There's another one on the Pearl Habor tragedy, I think it was -- I

I said that then because we wasn't in war and I thought then that maybe 
we wouldn't get in the war.  But now, you see, we couldn't say we was in perfect peace and all that kind of stuff.  And then we had 
another [?] thing in that we culdn't say -- we said Hitler's mean and 
hateful and violates international law.   That's why we [couldn't include] 
giving to England eve ything short of war.  You know, we had the short 
of war program,  lend-lease.
A: You've been right behind National Defense all the time, haven't you?
H:  Yessir.
A:  You have been helping out with your songs?  Tat su re is fine.  Just as a matter of history to show well you did understand the situation 
at that time-- of course, there's nothing wrong with the song
--  everybody was in the same position.  I'd like to record that.  Let's 
record that the way you did it in those days and tell me what composition 
song.
