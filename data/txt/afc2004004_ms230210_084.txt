Susan sortir Black Bay, i aller Laborie gagner sardine
Caille li ka bruler.
I dit [morn] you marcher,
[*Susan left BB, to go to Laborie
to buy sardines (food of poor)
Your house is burning*]
[*Cho: E le le le le, etc..*]
I marcher, i courir, i courir,
I heler, i heler, i trapper mal machoire.
Africaine ka marcher
Ti Congo ka marcher
Yo longer bords grande chemin ?
Ti Congo c'est liane douce
No longere pour l'honneur  ?
Nous pas ni doit

La riene Victoria
 C'est li qui mener Congo ici
Si oux faire Congo la paine
Ou ka faire la reine la paine

Trans:  Susanne left Black Bay, she went to Laborie to buy
sardines (the cheapest fish)
Her house caught fire,
She said "I walked, I walked,"
She ran, she ran.
She screamed, she screamed, until her jaw pained her
Africans can walk
Little Congolese can walk
They pace the high road
Little Congolese are liane vines
They do not stretch their honour
We do not have the right
Queen Victoria, was the one who brought the
Congolese here
If you cause the Congolese pain
You (also) make the queen unhappy.
(N.B.[)] The slave traffic had virtually ceased when
Victoria ascended the throne!)
