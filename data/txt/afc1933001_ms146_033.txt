Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Complying with your request, we are sending to the Library 
of Congress records on Mr. Lomax's list, using the franked 
labels which you enclosed with your letter.
You, of course, realize that this is a most unusual procedure
and we shall appreciate your returning the records
as soon as they have served your purpose.
Very truly yours,
