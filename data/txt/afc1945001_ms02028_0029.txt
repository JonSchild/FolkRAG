"I was up in Waterloo last week and the guy in the garage said he could get me all the new tires I need for $25 a piece. No need to hurry about getting them though because there will always be bootleggers with new tires. You can even get them still wrapped in the original paper. Course by winter you will have to pay $35 or $50 a piece, I imagine, but you'll still be able to get them." Traveling business man 8-8-42. 

"Sure I was down in Chariton and the guy there could get me new tires for $50 a pair. The way he did it was to park his car up town with a set of new tires on it and some salesman would come along and comment on the tires and the guy would say, 'sure they only have about 200 miles on them -- I'll sell you a couple for $50.' He said he had sold four pair that way in the last week." Second traveling business man 8-8-42.

"My mother came down to buy an electric stove but there were somany forms and regulations to read andfill out that she gave it upin despair." Business woman 8-3-42. 

"The OPA has been set up and so long and done nothing that they call it the Republican WPA." Business man 8-8-42.

"An awful lot of people think sugar rationing wasn't really necessary." Housewife 8-6-42.
