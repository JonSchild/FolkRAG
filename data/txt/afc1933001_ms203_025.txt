MEMORANDUM

FROM Alan Lomax
Archive of American Folk Song

TO THE CHIEF OF THE
Music Division
DIVISION

Professor Mary Elizabeth Barnicle stopped off with me for a short visit
January 31st on her way back from a recording trip to the Kentucky
Mountains. She reported to me that during her stay in Kentucky she had made
100 acetate discs of the religious folk-songs of the mountains. I think
that these discs would be a most important addition to the Archive's collection
and that they would be particularly pertinent at this time, in view of the recent
acquisition by the Archive of 258 discs of secular folk-songs from the same
region. I strongly urge that the Library take steps to secure for the Archive
the originals or duplicates of this important collection. I feel sure that
Professor Barnicle's friendliness toward the Archive will facilitate this
acquisition.
