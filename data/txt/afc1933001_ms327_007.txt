The Commonest Man in the World 
(From page nine)

HERE he is. His name is not
Johnson. It is Carl Sandburg. He
has written a million words about
Abraham Lincoln. He is the author 
of Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie
Years, of Abraham Lincoln: The
War Yeas, of Good Morning, 
America, of The People, Yes, of 
Rootabaga Stories.
   Carl Sandburg won the Pulitzer 
Prize for his recently published 
"Abraham Lincoln: The War
Years," of which Robert E. Sherwood 
wrote, "The people of this nation 
and this human race may well

salute and thank Carl Sandburg
for the magnitude of his contribution
to our common heritage."
Mentioned more and more frequently
as the next winner of the 
Nobel Prize for Literature, Sandburg
was last spring awarded the
honorary degree of Doctor of Letters
by both Harvard and Yale,
one of the few men in history so
honored in one year. He was the
only member of either academic
procession who did not wear a cap
and gown. He wore a blue serge
suit, baggy at the knees.
