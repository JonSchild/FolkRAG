To Dr. Spivacke

In the promise of completing the check list of the Archive
of American Folk Song, I have found that we shall need the
advice of various specialists in foreign languages, as;
Greek, Russian, Slovian and etc. I should like to request
that from time to time, Mr. Hakin of the Cataloguing Division
make available one of his skilled cataloguers to assist me
in these foreign language problems. This, actually, should
be on official library time because the material requiring
attention is part of the Library Folk Song Collection.
