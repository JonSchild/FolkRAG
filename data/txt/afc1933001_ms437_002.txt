Mr. John A. Lomax,
Division of Music,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax,
I am sending you herewith your copy of the
Ledbetter-Lomax-Macmillan agreement, executed by all
parties concerned. You will want this for your files.
Sincerely yours,
June E. Stone
Secretary to Mr. Brett

P.S. I certainly am sorry I forgot to enclose the
addressed stamped envelope in Mr. Brett's first letter to
you, thereby tarnishing our fine record!
