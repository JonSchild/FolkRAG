(1st WEEK OF THE 2ND MARRIAGE
THE WEDDING)
TL:  Now what's this?  It's all about. . .?
BJ:  My married life.
TL:  Your married life?  But why dind't people know that you
were married.  How did this work, exactly, in the beginning?
BJ:  Well, it jus' work like I tol' ya.  Um, when we first
was goin', startin' to goin' together, I was cookin' for them
already, ya know, before I even got the Holy Gho'.
An' so when ah, an' then they begin to talkin', talk like that
I was, ah, doin' other things with 'im.  But I wasn't, ya
understan'.
TL:  The people around town?
BJ:  Yeah, yea, that's right.  An' his, his, ah, brother an'
his sister-in-law, ya know, all them was talkin', ya know.
That is to throw me, 'cause they didn't think I was goin' to
get no husband nohow, ya know?  An' everybody thought I was,
I suppose, I was lyin'.  An' so they was just kinda outdone
about that anyway.  The devil!  That's just the devil stirs up
things, ya know.  Anyway, they jus' kept on jabberin' an'
jabberin' an so.  Well, that Saturday when I an' George -- when
George got ready to marry -- I an' George was, got ourse'f  prepared,
ya know.  An' he come up to me.  We -- I was cleanin' fish,
gettin' ready to sell fish that night for the church, as we
usually does.  An' ah, he walked there an' tol' me to come an'
go with him.  An' I got to the car; he had borrowed our Pastor's
car.  When I got to the car, I asked him where he was goin', he
said, "Come on, I'm goin' to 'Chobee to marry ya."  But nobody
down here, ain' told nobody right, right there; girls that
he'p 'im an' everything with the fish, they didn't know it.
Said, "Come on."
