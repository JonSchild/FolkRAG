Dear  Spivacke :

Before now you have 
been    a report of  my 
activities I have had neither
the strength or the time. I 
worked hard at the stops and
the drives between     many
miles of travel, not always
over land surface pavements
-- some distances through driv--
ing rain.  in brief:
At Columbia, S.C. we record -
ed the singing of a funeral 
choir selected for their ability  
to sing down the restrictions
