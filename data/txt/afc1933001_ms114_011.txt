Friday afternoon. 

Dearest Umpty:

From the volume that I mailed you the other day and from the scathing letter 
from fatherthat came this morning I gather that I am the bottleneck of this whole kinnery.
Once again I bow my head and apologize to all concerned, whether interested or not. Its
all my fault and I am sorry and worthless and trifling and lazy and Maybe I will do better.

Your nice letter is herein answered and I would have let you know immediately
what week and to come only our plans have been so up in the air. Last week end three of
our young flyer friends had girls that were supposed to be coming for the week end only 
none of us was quite sure enough to say one way or the other hand then of course they all 
came and we had them all of three days mot of the waking hours.  Then we have lost our 
best friend, kind of gradually for ten days and we have been involved in farewell parties 
for him. Then Monday Chris had the duty for Saturday given him and then it was changed ti
Sunday and he still doesn't know wheich day he will have to be away.  Next week-end should 
be perfect for us and if it suits you and Margaret why don't you plan to make it then and 
we will howl some together.  If we decide to go to the officer's club Dance which is each 
Saturday night you have to have a tux and I don't remember you have one and if not no harm 
done we can gather in the bar and then honkytonk if that suits you or stay home and 
mourn over the state of the world if we are in that kind of a mood.
I have been horribly busy and stay kind of draggy all the time from this climate.
I have been doing all the work here, and this is a large house and then doing all my spare 
hours on some Nave correspondance courses that the Department thinks that Chris is doing.
Anyway after a few more my typeing will enough improved so I can get me a job 
maybe -- from the above line I lose heart again.
Let me know your plans and anyway, duty or no duty or things any time you tow 
could come would suit me, I'm lonely and have a large wish, to see you.
