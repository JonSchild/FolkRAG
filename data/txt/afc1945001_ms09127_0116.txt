Tall Tales the Service Men Spin
In many Army Camps today when the boys are free for amusement they get together and see who can tell the wildest story. One of the fellows may start it off with this one.
"Why over in the last air field where I was stationed we had a hangar so large that we had to have two weather reporting stations. One to tell what the weather was on the outside and the other to tell the weather in the hangar. It was so foggy in there at times that planes would take off from one side of the hangar and get lost before they reached the other end. The only plane that could go from one end to the other was a large bomber with many gallons of gas.
