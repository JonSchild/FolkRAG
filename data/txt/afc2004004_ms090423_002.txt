CHAPTER 11 9.

SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE DELTA

Lying between the Missipissippi and the Yazoo Rivers the Delta extends 
to Memphis, Tennessee in the North and to Vicksburg, Mississippi in 
the South. 1. It is called "the Delta" because the plain and basin are 
formed by the alluvial deposits of the Mississippi River. The dwelling 
units of large plantations, sprawling cotton fields, highways 
and telephone poles are the most conspicuous features of the scenery. 
In the Delta counties, over eighty per cent of the agricultural 
acreage is devoted to the production of cotton.
In 1940 the total population of the Delta was 508,022; of the 
total, Negroes comprised roughly 362,000 or seventy two per cent. 2. 
Some of the most important characteristics of the present day Negro population 
in the Delta are: (1) that more than eighty seven percent of 
Negro males are engaged in agriculture; (2) that they are predominantly 
tenant farmers; and (3) that they are largely illiterate.

1. "The alluvial plain ... contains some of the richest land in the 
world. Nearly all of it is bottom land, produced and fed through 
countless eons by the inundations of the Mississippi River and reclaimed 
for usage by a system of powerful levees that hold the floods 
in check. The alluvial deposits have been found to be 35 feet deep in 
many places" - Federal Writers Project, Mississippi (New York:Viking 
Press,1938), pp.31-33.
2. Thirteen Mississippi counties fall within this area. They are 
Warren, Yazoo, Sharkey, Issaquena, Humphreys, Washington, Sunflower, 
Boliver, Coahoma, Tunica, Quitman, Tallahatchie, Leflore. - See
