Good morning blues, blues howdo you do,?
I'm feeling fairly well, podner, how are you?

13   If you gonna leave me, look what a hole you gonna leave me in,
My papa drinkin' whiskey, mama drinkin' do-do gin.

 I taken you , woman , to be my bes' frien',
Look what a hole you done lef' me in.

10  Give your man your biscuits , husbands your corn-bread,
When he tells you sumpin about it, poke out your mouth an' get mad.

My baby;s gone an' she won' come back no mo', 
She went away on dat M& O .

15  Looky here, people, I can't understand myself,
My baby's leavin' , I cain' know nobody else.

Looky here, people, I want you all tomunderstand,
My baby leavin', would not even shake my hand.

Your  Baby's gone, cryin' won' make her stay,
Aw, de more you cry, de more she goin' away.

Looky here people, I can't understand myself,
My baby is leavin', I acn't love nobody else

14 [13] Went to de depot, Lawd, she fold her sarms
It was too late to holler, Lawd, when de train was gone.

12  Goodby, baby, gal an' you call that gone,
I feel mistreated, lawd, but I can' let on.

First verse repeated.

Oh, Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawdy-Lawd,
