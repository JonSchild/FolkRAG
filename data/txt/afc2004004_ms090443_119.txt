young people---they don't know nothing.  They don't even know the
laws.  They don't even know that the end is the beginning (?).  They
don't know nothing.  And right now you can try to tell him something for
his own good.  Know what he tell you?  "That's old fashioned.  That's

But I've had it.  I walked the levee--now yall listen at this good--
I walked the levee and on the woods side, btween the levee and the
Mississippi River, didn't know where I was [at],  eating pocorns, and
persimmons, and grapes for weeks.

AL:You mean you were lost or you were running from something?
WB:No, I be running.  Drank water out of a horse track or out of a mule
track, by a little running stream.

AL:How did that happen?  What were you running from?
WB:You know when you be[e]ing on these jobs     these bagfulls
that you get     and they get you running.  You get to turning
loose 2 or 3 pistols, you don't know what happened, you know, and you
just leave, because you don't know who they're looking for.  But in case 
somebody might see you, you stay gone 2 or 3 weeks, a month.  Then you
come up there.  I met some good people.  .  .  

AL:Do you remember the particular time that you ran off into the woods
like that?
WB:Oh yeah, I did it more than once.  In 1936, 1939, 1942.  But now,
each one of those times that I was gone, I was gone because I was
scared and they wasn't looking for me but I thought they was..
