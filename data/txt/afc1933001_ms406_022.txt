[*1936*]

DONEY GAL

"One time my uncle came to see us folks on our ranch in Oklahoma.
When he got ready to go the rain was pouring down; but the
weather didn't stop him.

"We watched him ride over the hill headed for the roundup,
singing his favorite cowboy songs

"It's rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are bound to go.

He was a good singer, too. He called his horse 'Doney Gal,' his
sweetheart.  None of us ever saw him again."
--Mrs. Louise Henson, San Antonio, Texas.

DIAMOND JOE*

"Diamond Joe was a Texas cattleman, the story goes, so rich
that he was said to wear diamonds for his vest buttons. I learned
this song years ago," says J. B. Dillingham, for fifty years a conductor
on Houston and Texas Central trains running out of Austin.
