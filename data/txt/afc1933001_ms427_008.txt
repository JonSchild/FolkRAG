THE BLACKSMITH
                                                            -3-
(Manuscript)

In the smithy by the fire,
Stands the blacksmith at his forge.
Clangs the hammer, sparks of fire are flying
And he sings o'er it a song.

Of the freedom which is coming
Sings he loudly, sings he long.
And he knows not from his brows are pouring
Beads of sweat, heedless of song.

Fully o'ercome by the freedom,
He sings his song and loud it rings.
But the hammer sounds much louder,
And he hears not what he sings.

                                         ----

BREAK DOWN BARRIERS
(Page 3 - Y.W.C.A. Song Book)

O world of industry from sea to sea,
Filled with barriers of race and creed,
O loving neighbors, hear our plea
In this age of strife and greed.

Chorus: Break down barriers, change our thoughts
With the help of the One above
Break down barriers, change our thoughts
Help widen the reach of love.

Father of Mercies help us to find
'Mongst the people of every land,
The loving brotherhood of mankind
And help us to understand.

Chorus: Break down barriers, change our thoughts
With the help of the One above
Break down barriers, change our thoughts,
Help widen the reach of love.
