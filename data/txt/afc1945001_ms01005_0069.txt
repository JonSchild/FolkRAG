Dear sir:

You may already have the attack Prof. Gustave Meyer tripe.

This stuff is bad, because astrologers, laf readers, and 
palmists appeal to the most credulous and hysterical classes.

I can see a lot of needless worry and agitation as a result 
of this screed, because many dumb editors will print it,
as a joke, not realizing that moron readers will not
see the joke.

Some one should crack down on this Meyer person, as I don't think 
our war effort is based on tea leaves or astrology.
Sincerely,
Walter T Forbes
