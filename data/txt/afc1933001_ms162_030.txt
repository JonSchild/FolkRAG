Der sir:
My organization (Sigma Tau Delta, Epsilon Delta chapter) is
very much interested in the possibility of sponsoring a program
of folk music and singing by yourself to be presented to Wilson
Teachers College. In line with this interest, I have been
authorized to inquire as to whether or not you would be available
for such an engagement from 2:40 to 3:40 on Monday, November
18, 1940, and your rate for furnishing such a program.
As noted, the engagement would require one hour and would
be at Wilson Teachers College, Eleventh and Harvard Streets, N.W.
Washington, D.C. No admission will be charged.
Please reply as soon as possible to:

Very truly yours
