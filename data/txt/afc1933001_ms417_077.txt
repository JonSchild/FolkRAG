DEDICATION

I am told by my publishers that the person
whom a book is dedicated to allus buys a copy.

Therefore and wherefore, I now

Dedicate this book to everybody who has had
or is in hard luck, hard times, been in
debt, stomped upon and tromped upon, or otherwise
oppressed by the big guys, also [xxxxx] the man
to whom I owe a dollar.

True as the average,
Woody
