Trip Unearths Story of Texan Who Poured Water Into Well All Night

Visit to Bosque County Nets Tale Told by Cowhand To Will Rogers

Firsst, on Monday, came Tom Lea and his wife to spend the night with us. They had been to the art exhibition at Houston, where a portrait painted by Tom won a prize of $50. He lives in El Paso, where he was born and reared. His burning desire is to paint the land and the people, with their history and traditions, to which he belongs, and through are to make his fellow-citizens conscious of the significances of their own environments, of their own cultural inheritance.

In contrast, an art dealer from Chicago, who was in Texas some weeks ago with a cargo of paintings, which he was displaying in expensive hotel suites over the state, told me that his best customers where the wives of oil men. He said that they fell for the paintings of Europeans, and that if a dealer could show a photograph of an old castle and convince a prospective purchaser that a certain painting--often a third-rate work--had hung in that castle, the sale of it was easy.

Meanwhile Tom Lea's picture of John C. Duval and Bigfoot Wallace--reproduced as a frontispiece for my small book on Duval--is waiting for somebody to buy it and place it in the Texas collection at the University of Texas. Aside from its validity in the realm of pure art, how it speaks to one who has delighted in the writings of "Texas John" or in the rollicky character of old Bigfoot!

A Real Texas Museum

The next visitor was Frederick Simpicch of the National Geographical Magazine. This magazine several years ago ran his long article, almost a book, "So Big Texas." Lasts fall it printed another article of his on the rio Grande. Now he is working again on the Southwest.

Helen Huntington is writing a novel around a character who will start up the trail from Texas. She is down in the brush country, getting the lay of the land, and trying to comprehend the women who mothered the trail-driving breed. She is sure to produce something genuine; she has already proven her powers.

After these three highly inspiring visitors in a row, I took out myself, to make a talk on Texas literature in Waco. The big shot on the program--of a school teachers' convention--was Mr. Walter Pitkin, notorious for his book, "Life Begins at Forty." Of all the shallow, empty, wordy bunk I have ever listened to from public speakers, this speech was about the climax. It was thoroughly in keeping with the kind of pabulum that education-educated executives habitually choose to give teachers. Looking at a paunchy white-haired man and a hopelessly-grouping young woman taking notes on Pitkin's pretentious jargon gave me something worse than a case of the botts.

Koss Barry of Bosque

I needed a tonic and I got it. I'd never been in Bosque county, and I'd been planning for two years or so to visit it. Bosque county is where John Lomax as a boy lived beside the old Chisholm trail--as the men who drove up it called it, though some historians now want to call it something else--and heard the cowboy songs that he was later to collect and make popular over the world. In Sam Geiser's noble book, "Naturalist of the Frontier"--the Texas frontier--I had read about Gustaf Belfrage's career in Bosque county. A young man from Bosque county used to persist in trying to get me to go in partnership with him to dig up one of the buried treasure of that region. Bosque county is where Capt. Jack Cureton lived, and where his grandson, Judge C. M. Cureton, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas, was born. Here ranged that extraordinary frontiersman--Buck Barry, about whom James K. Greer wrote his book. My first [?] was [?] one of [?] restless to wait. Mrs. Barry advised him to consult George Lemmons, who lived only two miles away. The stranger went to the Lemmons ranch. Yes, Mr. Lemmons knew the league of land, but he didn't have time to conduct the stranger over it.

"However," he said, "in the morning you get on that fat, fresh horse you see there and ride over the land by yourself. That tall 'mountain' yonder is in the middle of it. Leave your played-out horse here to rest. I'll see you tomorrow night."

The stranger was gone all day. When he came in, he wanted first thing to sell his league of land to his host.

"Why," Lemmons asked, "what would I want it for? My cattle graze on it now when they want to. I have absolutely no use for it."

"Yes," the stranger said, "but some day this country will be fenced, and you'll have to provide your own pasturage for your own cattle."

"No, this country is too rough. It will never be fenced," Lemmons declared.

Bent on Trading

But the stranger was bent on trading off his league of land. "I'll tell you what I'll do," he finally said. "I'll deed the whole league (4409 acres) to you for that horse you let me ride today."

"I need the horse and I don't have money to pay taxes on the land," Lemmons closed the argument by saying.

Koss (Kossuth) Barry rides his horse every day. "That horse keeps me well," he said, I noticed that he didn't use tobacco or drink coffee. He told me that he had never drunk a cup of coffee in his life and that he did not drink any kind of liquor. He thinks temperate habits may have a good deal to do with his general good health at the age of 90 years. Not with credulity, but as a matter of interest, he related how when he was born an old negro woman said that he would never have any diseases if he was given some bear fat to suck.
