Tape 48. Mickey Doherty.

Sean: Sometime ago you told me that your grandmother was a 
great story-teller.

Mick: She was a great story-teller. When I was small around the 
fire she used to to tell me a lot of old stories. Well, she told me 
one very interesting story about a man and his son that lived on 
a moor in a sod house, an they had no means. The only property 
they had in the world was two goats, and they lived very poor. 
This boy one morning took a notion that he would go and seek work
He told the father. So the father agrred to that.

So the poor boy got prepared and he walked on till he done 
fifty mile and he could get no work. And at the end of the fifty 
miles he saw a grand house away up on the side of a hill. It
appeared to him like a castle. So he sat down and he was exhausted
and tired and he was hungry. So he looked East and he looked
West and he didn't know where he was, but he thought in any case 
he would go up to this castle to see if he could make a better
of it. So when he went up to this czstle he met this millionaire
that lived in this castle. He met him in the avenue coming down
and him reading a book. So the millionaire halted him and asked

Well, the boy agreed to that. He got a bed for him in this
outside house, got a fire kindled. But the next morning the boy 
was very early afoot, and he got the [?] brushes and was going
to brush around the yard. 

So this young lady she came to the tub one day — that's the
millionaire's daughter, and she looks down at this beautiful young
boy. She says to the father, she says, "When did this chap come
here?"
"He came," he says, "yesterday evening," he says, "here seeking 
work," he says, "so I took him for a week. It'll rest his feet. I
have no work for him but I took pity on the poor boy and kept him
for a week."
"Well,"  she says, "He's a beautiful young man. I never saw a nicer
young man. He's very good-looking."

So the next morning, the young feller got at his work, but she came
to the window again and looks down at him, and she smiled at him.
But to make a long story short, she fell in love with him. She
called for the father and said she would never have no other boy
but this boy. "He's very goodlooking," she says," And I'd like to
