used in the direct counteraction part of the program. Phonies with a special group
reference should not be used alone. It will be found that there are rumors about
Negroes evading the draft, Jews evading the draft, defense workers evading the draft,
management evading the draft. To deal with these rumors individually is playing into
Axis hands. As the Office of War Information has repeatedly pointed out, the major
theme of the Axis propaganda efforts is to divide us, to set off one part of the
community against another, to divide the United Nations. If we take any of these
rumors and consider a rumor about a single group as a single problem, we are doing
exactly what the Axis is trying to get us to do, that is, we are treating parts of the
whole as if they were separate wholes. It would be wiser to collect a number of these
similar phonies and present them all together with the sort of counteraction that
would point out that nobody is evading the draft, and perhaps more important, that
we cannot, with any validity, talk about these parts of the community as if they were
really separate sections. The draft is a national draft. It is administered throughout
the nation on a uniform basis. We don't have one draft for management, and another
draft for labor, and another draft for each of the minority groups designed on the
basis of religion or race, or national origin, or supposedly linguistic background,
or Axis mythology. That to talk in such terms is serving Hitler. 
        While for the general educational programs and special campaigns which may be
devised by the educational director and his advisory council, all media of communication
should be used for the direct counteraction sections. The radio should be avoided.
Any device which makes it possible for people to lose the continuity of the total unit
should be avoided. Random listening, casual exploring on the dial until one hears something
interesting, makes radio inappropriate in this type of work. Similarly, street
corner speeches would be inappropriate, though they might be useful for other campaigns. 
        The direct counteraction program should be used to eliminate some few specific
