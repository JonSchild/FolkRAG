"I told Kay that people were talking about him being mixed up with the Japs as a spy and do you know what he did. Went to his desk and brought out letters from the mayor and the chief of police and prominent men in Ogden testifying to his character. Mrs. Kay cried right out when I told her. She said, 'Why, Kay and I have lived in Ogden for 25 years. This is our home. Ogden has been good to us. Why do people talk like that?"
                                                                      ***

"I know the girl who sells bonds and she told me herself that Kay buys a $100 bond every week."

                                                                              ***

'When they rounded up the Japs, they got in the locker of one Jap who had been a mechanic for the S. P. (Southern Pacific Railroad) for 20 years. He had all kinds of maps. I know this for a fact because I saw the maps. They were all done in Japanese letters and it would take a translator to make anything out of them but he was one alright. No doubt about it. Smart devil, too. Couldn't understand English, except when he wanted to. They asked him, 'Are you for Japan or the United States?' .  . 'No savvy.' 
.  . 'Do you want the United States to win the war?' He said 'Ya, Ya', but he wasn't very enthusiastic about it. They've taken all those birds off the railroad now."

                                                                                  ***

"Well, I had a letter from ___________ and he said the Utah boys at Fort Lewis (Washington) are all ready to sail for overseas."

                                                                                    ***

"I heard the boys up at Fort Lewis have been itching to get into action but we just don't have the equipment for them."

                                                                                   -9-
