I didn't go to school. From my childhood there are lots
of things I remember and lots of things I don't.   Some things I 
remember just a bit but I can't explain the rest.

"Bonne année" We went to my Grandfather's every year
to sing Happy New Year, not long but we sang. 

Happy New Year, Grand'maman
Good day, Happy New Year, my girl
Bonjour, bonne année mémère

Hello, Happy New Year, Grand'maman

Happy New Year, Happy New Year, my girl

[Repeated several times]

[Grandmother said] My girl, I wish you a beautiful and 
happy New Year. Be a pretty girl, and don't bring shame to your
Maman or your Papa, and the most beautiful day is the day of your
death.
She said to Grand'maman, " Grand'maman, I wish you
wonderful health, and all your life never to be sick, never be in
poverty [misère], and that the most beautiful day be the day of 
your death."

All day to children and guests Bonjour, Bonne année
would be sung. [Story and song repeated several times]

And for Christmas we had a song [sung] "Go three times
around the table. Go get something to have fun. ....."
Other songs we couldn't hear because we were supposed to be in
bed and wern't supposed to listen or to hear or see or to drink, but
it was pretty and sad.

....[games, contre danses, whiskey mentioned]

We had games where we could run around the table, and others
like Daygo.

Swing Daygo, fare ye well
Swing Daygo, fare ye well
Say Ha la lees and hah lah lah
Oh fare ye well. [Repeat]

[*Sometimes couldn't 
clap as making a 
chain - holding 
hands or swinging*]

Choose your part
Say ha la lees and ha lah lah [*(clap)*]
Oh fare ye well. [*(clap)*]
Jeff Riley, fare ye well
Jeff Riley, fare ye well
Say hah lah lees and hah lah lah
Oh fare ye well

[*"I know when hands 
are clapped."*]

Girls couldn't take hands when.... clap. When I clap
it's when boys tapped girls' hands and it was called swing.
