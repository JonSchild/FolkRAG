people know themselves. Of course
I don't want to turn soft. But
I need 6 months of excercise
& laughter.
June 3rd London.
The long silence. Finished
script. Flew it to London.
Everyone liked it. Flew it
back to Dublin, in love with
R again. She a bit with me.
Produced show, failed only
in not planning rehearsals &
making friends with engineers.
Show half baked in production.
Bitched & betrayed by BBC
crew who don't like my arrogant
absorption in Robin. She
was the best thing in the cast.
Left Dublin & arrived London
