The third song in this case was another Zepaules(?), and 
lasted about five minutes. 
(49B3)
Faire salui, e-wa, e-wa, 
Legba bouke ave' yo, 

Salute th king, the king, 
Legba is wore out with them, 

(49B4, the last recorded song of the evening, was put in 
here because I had used up all my blank disks and wanted to 
record a snatch of the song. It will be discussed in its 
proper place after 53B2)

(50A1)
The hounsis then called on Papa Loco, god of the winds. 
A Yen Valou. 

Moin dit, Loco, moin Yen Valou moin, 
Ago, Loco, moin Yen Valou moin, 
Moin dit, Loco, moin Yen valou moin, 
Sogrelo. 

I say, Loco, I salute you, (literally, "my greetings")
Ago, Loco, I salute you, 
I say, Loco, I salute you, 
Be of good heart. 

Papa Loco and Papa Damballa march side by side. And in the next 
song Papa Loco, sent by Damballa, gives them his message. 

(50 A2)
Papa Loco, parlex pitites-yo pou' moin, 
Ou'a dit yo, mauvais temps prend moin, 
Papa Loco, parle pitites-yo pou' moin,
