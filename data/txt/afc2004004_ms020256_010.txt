BJ TAPE 42, p. 8

Melton said, "Git this pepper [pot!] chil'!"   Said, "Pour out it, 
'Cause I ain't gonna pour out nothin'!" I put the raw pepper in 
my shoes, the red pepper, so she couldn't pick up my track to hurt 
me. I knew the folk could do that.
         An' so I said, "Well, she can't hurt me no other way. I ain' 
gonna eat nothin' from 'er, else drink nothin' from 'er."
          But she got me someway; I don' know how she got me, but she 
got me. I mean, I left there an' went to Fladah, an' I didn't 
come back in 25 years!!
          But yet, after all, ah Miz Melton, ah, I wrote to them. An' 
they, she said she kep' that stuff up an' continue on with it an' 
say, until she. . . She went to this mean in Cordeal an' said the 
man tol' 'er it's the greatest thing she ever done. You know, 
sumpthin' that she had done was powerful. Sumpthin' she had 
done was powerful. But for her to git some red pepper an' ah, an' 
blue stone and ah, an' sprinkle it all over, you know, boil it 
an' sprinkle it all in the yard, too, ya see. An' so she did 
that, an' that was all other she did.
         You know - - an' ah, when I seed Rosetta, I was back here 
an' married George an' got these children an' back here ta, an', 
an' come back to St. Simons, at that time, an' ah, I seed, an' ah, 
we got a hearin' from ah, from Rosetta an' Pinkey got two chirrun.
AL: She was all right?
BJ: All right. Got two chirrun. She said, "Them two chirrun can 
pick cotton an' Pinkey can pick her some cotton!" Said, "Pinkey 
don't say - - " But she never did marry. Pinkey got - - But it's 
one-arm man wanted to marry her after that, too, but, but [what] she 
hadn't married him then. But I'm tellin' you that was sumpin' 
to think about!
