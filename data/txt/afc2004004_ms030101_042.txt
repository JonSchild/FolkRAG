Go and send for the minister that 
he may pray by me
Go and send for de doctor to heal up
                       my wounds
"                    for de young man who 
lately deceive me 
Says give me a pallet that I may 
lay down
––––––––––
Take 16 fine horses to carry my 
                         coffin
Take "     "     ladies to follow behind
Just put in my coffin a bu[n]ch 
of sweet 
violets
That the people may smell me
as I pass by.
