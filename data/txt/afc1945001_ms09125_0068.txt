wandering around in Scotland
and he was lost. He
looked down the road and
saw a scothman coming.
when the scotch man got
there he said, "say bud I am
lost could you get me back to town,"
Then the scotchman said "is
there any reward for  you?"
then the american said "why
no", then the scotch man
said then you're still lost.
