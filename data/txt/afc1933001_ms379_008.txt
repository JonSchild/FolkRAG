De door slam.

Dem [[?]]ladies gone on an' tell [[?]]all de 
white folks dat a ole man been in trouble, an' do please, 
come an' see whether he killed some one or no.

Dat night Mister Sheriff say "Liminary hearin'" in de 
mornin', Mike."

An' [[?]]dare I was. Cindy and de chillum was 'round a big lighted fire. Plenty of fire wood. Dat one thing don't cost 
us nothin' but hard work. I know dey wasn't hungry. Plenty 
of potatoes for roast. But where they Papa been? I can hear 
the littlest boy, little Mike, a-cryin' for he daddy. An' I 
can hear Cindy tellin' him.

Yo' [you] papa can take care of hisself. Ain't nothin' big 
enough to harm yo' papa, chillun."

An' I think about how little Mike fears [[?]]dem river [[?]] varmint
He was allus talkin' about de 'gater an' de snake an' things. 
An' Cindy know dem rice-fields been full of bogs. Den too, a woman is
powerful funny sometimes. If a man don't turn up dey all time
' spicion somethin'. An' I reckon Cindy'll be sayin' to 
herself, "I'm feared Mike musta got in trouble," An' if 
she think dat dis be one time when she [might] think what so.

At supper time dey send me up some bread. But it been hard. 
It so hard my tooth can't break 'em. An' I let 'em go back to 
de cook what bake 'em. Den de sheriff send for me to come downstairs 
in de kitchen. An' here what he say: 

"Mike, you didn't take no supper!"

An' I tell him 'bout dat bread, an' he say,

"How 'bout some coffee?"

An' I say as how I'd be glad for coffee ----- would appreciate.
