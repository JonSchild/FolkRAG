BJ TAPE 6, p. 28

AL:    No?
BJ:     I heard, I heard peoples tell folks to go to West Hell,
but I don't know what part they find that at.   'Cause I heard
peoples tell 'em to go to West Hell.   Why, what's the difference
in Wes' Hell an' East Hell?
AL:    What is it?
BJ:     What, what is the diffrunt in Wes' Hell an' Eas' Hell?  Ha, ha,
do you know?   I don't know.   Do you know?
AL:    I think West Hell is supposed to be hotter.
BJ:     [Hotter] Harder?
AL:    Hotter.
BJ:     Hotter?
AL:    Yeah.
BJ:     I don't know...Ah, I believe that um, maybe there's hell
in, in the Wes'.   I mean, hit would be, if it would be that way.
Ya know, if it would be any hell besides here, it, hit, maybe hit
would be in the west.   'Cause Jesus comin' back in the east,
maybe they jes', jes' wouldnt' have any hell out there.   Ya
know?   Hah, but it's gittin' hell over there, ain't it?   Ha, ha,
ha!  [But then,] Over there in the Holy Land gittin' to be hell now!   Maybe
that's why they say "Go to Wes' Hell," they didn't wanna talk
about the Eas' 'cause they know Jesus was comin' in the eas'.
Maybe tha's why the peoples say, "Go to Wes' Hell."
         An' in the north, ya know, Jesus say he, ah...
AL:    Well, I heard that Diddy-wah-diddy was on beyond West
Hell.
BJ:     Hum, hum, hum, hum!
AL:    When you were really bad you got to get to Diddy-wah-diddy.
BJ:     Hah, you had to go to Diddy-wah-diddly, yeah!   I, ah, well
