MORE a single woman. But tha's what -- What's what they did. 
An' tha's the way we know about...
    An' long time, when I was firs' lil', in some places, boys
wore short pants. Ya know, call 'em knee pants. When they
married, they dropped they pants.
TL: Oh, really!
BJ: Uh-huh. Th' so when they married they dropped their pants.
Many families let they boys dress...Even, even in our family.
The first pair of long pants Paw put on Bill, he runned away. 
TL: What happened?
