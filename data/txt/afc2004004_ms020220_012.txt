bark.  I know he's got a gopher.

tears.  Jes' big funny eyes.  An' I carry 'em in an' [Randy], man, an'
cut 'em up.  Know what I mean?  Scald 'em an' clean 'em an'
cook 'em.  An' I did not have a stove, that whole time.
AL:     Since you've been down in Florida, did you ever hear of

BJ:      I know, I heard a Uncle Mundy.
AL:     What?

know about Daddy Mention.
AL:     Well, what about Uncle Mundy?
