Dear Sir just a card. In reply to
your recent letter on March 20th
I have answered your letter and
also sign papers. You should
have them by this time. Now
Mr. Allan please permitt me
to say. I don't feel that you
have been very promp in your
dealings with me in this

I have the most convidence in
your integrity. I will also l look

convienace.
Respectfully yours
