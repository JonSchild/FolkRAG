19 B STEINBERG p.2

A: I haven't had a very difficult time. I helped a number of my friends to
     escape but I had no difficulty. The Gestapo were not organized then.
Q: Why was it necessary for you to leave Europe?
A: Well I had a number of friends who were socialistic and involved in the
     move and party and I disliked the place to a great extent and there was
     nothing more to do.
Q: Did you teach in the university for a while after Hitler came into power?
A: I resigned
Q: You don't know about the curtailment.[That came immediately after Hitler]
A: That came immediately after Hitler came into power - a day or two later.
     Everything changed and then the Nazi took over the running of the place and
     no person could breathe or move freely.
Q: How did they take over the industrial plants?
A: That didn't happen immediately. It happened in Germany gradually. In
     Austria it happened within a very short time and they had order the German
     people sufficiently trained to take over the jobs.
Q: A friend of mine at the University of Vienna - a medical student told me
     before Hitler came in the Jews and non-jewish were divided in the classroom
     and riots broke out later frequently.
A: This is true. Immediately in the 
     factory where I worked it turned out that chemical engineers were deeply
     involved in the Nazi and didn't behave fairly with their co-workers.
Q: Could you tell us what you think America ought to do in the present whole
     situation?
A: I can only tell you I would like to. I would like to have an active part 
     to fight against Hitler.
