Mrs. McLeod - Seal
Mrs. Johnstone - Mermaid

Keening - they used to do it 
prof. keeners - the last was at 
Father -- 's funeral, but the 
priest put a stop to it -- And 
it was so terrible at the time 
Her young man was shot at sea 
they keened then & [then] my 
tears ran down.
He was drned at sea -- 
Oh my - poor thing - Yes
(intake of breath)
They may do it at Erisbaay
 but they wouldn't like to do 
anything the priest didn't like.
