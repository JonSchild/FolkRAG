MR. FOUGET  Yeah, well the, that, that's
how Dennis started.  [Cat Duced] [UNCLEAR] was our sheriff
for many years.  He died a few years back.  He was driving a
taxi, I believe, in [Opalusis.]  And he was on a run, he was
probably in a cat house and everything.  So they pick up, I
mean [De and Dennis] and went in and made some record.  You
know, he knew where to go.  They didn't know where to go.
And I don't know, maybe they'd sell them records 25 cents a
record or something like that, you know.  But even though,
it was a lot of money in those days.  But they had a lot,
well I better not say this.
A. LOMAX  Go ahead.
MR. FOUGET  They had a lot of good
musicians, just put it that way, that never went, never
made any record.  I had a, an uncle that got killed right
across the, where that boulay got killed, right in front of 
his house.  To me was one of the best violin players that
I heard.  And he never owned a violin, never owned one.  He
wouldn't play at dances.  Like me, well I never did go a 
play in big halls, you know, those big, big crowds.  I had
my own crowd for, for about three years.  I played two
violin and, and a guitar and a banjo.  And then I found out
I was stupid, you know.  We didn't have no electricity.  It
was all kerosene lamp.  No fan, naturally.  It was hot in
them houses.  I was always all wet like an old saddle blanket
