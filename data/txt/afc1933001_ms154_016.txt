fully called, is a Southern product.  She was born in
Mississippi, with a line of ministers behind her.  She
came to Alabama while quite young, and still lives here.

prominent figure in Music Clubs in Birmingham.  It
was during the Biennial of Music Clubs in that city, that
she was prevailed upon to give to the world her stor
of fold-lore and negro melodies.  Through the efforts
of admiring professionals as a reader of note, and 
since her "Southern Melodies" have been compiles by
Carrie Jacobs-Bond, she has been much in demand
everywhere.
