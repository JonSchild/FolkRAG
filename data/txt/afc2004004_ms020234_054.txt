(RE: LOVING PEOPLE)

married him?
BJ:      No. . .no, no.
TL:      About him trusting you and about. . .?
BJ:      No, hum-um.  Ya see, I know one thing:  If I'd a-found out
he didn't trust me, I wouldn't been with 'im.   I just know that.
TL:     Would've upped and left?
BJ:      Tha's all.   An' he                                    made up my mind.  And
I'd find out he wasn't to suit me, just I would with anybody else
I'd a-been with, I wouldn't, wouldn't fool with 'im no longer,
tha's all.  'Cause, see, growin' on. . .Ya see, love is a thing
that grows, if you plant it an' then nurse it, ya see.   But you
can kill it, ya know, an', see.   You can kill it.   You can kill
out love with God, you know you can kill out love with me.   Hah!

[*RE: LOVING PEOPLE*]
With anybody else, ya see?   Love is just like a plant.   Ya got to
nurse it an' nurse it in the right way.   An' everybody don't be
fed the right way -- I mean the same way, ya know?
TL:      Everybody doesn't. . .?
BJ:      Don't be fed with love the same way.
TL:      Is going to be?   Or isn't?
BJ:      Don't be.  D-don't be.   They can't be.   Because every plant
and, th-that you plant, is not alike.   Some plants like a lot a
water, they haf ta have it, ta live by.   An' some plants, ya don't water
very much.   Ya water some plants too much, they'll die.   You got to
understand a person the same way.   Just how to treat them an' how
ta do.  An' if you  come to understandin', then you know what ta
do, ya see?   You know what they don't like.   You put sumpin' on
the table, you know your husban' don't eat it.   No use a tryin'
ta make him eat it, see?   You kill out confidence an' everything
else in cookin'.   See what I mean; it's the same way with love.
