Mr. Alan Lomax
67 Perry Street
New York, N.Y.

Dear Alan:

The records you requested were checked over
here and the duplicate we could find was shipped
to you in care of Stith Thompson on the 24th. But
we have received a notice from the American Railway
Express Agency to the effect that you had gone and
the package remains undelivered.  Their notice to
us from Bloomington was postmarked the 30th.  Had
you gone?  If so, OK.  If not, the express agency
office there made a mistake which I hope did not unhinge
you.  The error was not ours, in this case at least.

How goes your work?

Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Archive of
American Folk Song
