Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.
Lord, whence are thy hands so rent and torn?
They were pierced tonight by many a thorn,
They were pierced tonight by many a thorn.

Far up the mountain thunder riven
From the side of the rocky steep,
There arose a glad shout to the gate of heav'n,
"Rejoice, I have found my sheep."
And the angels echoed around the throne,
"Rejoice, the Lord brings back His own,
Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!

[?] ALL YOU TENDER HEARTED

[?] tender hearted,
[?] I'd call,
[?] it started.
Come [?] one and all.

Last Wednesday night there was a light
Seen shining on the hill,
There mother ran with all her might,
While everything was still.

She went into the neighbor's house
Some hundred yards away,
She sat down and talked with them,
But did not mean to stay.

Don't stay too long mother, there,
For we are lonesome here,
I'll give some liniment, she said,
And then return again.

But when she started home again,
Her house was in a flame,
She cried, alas! my babes are gone,
And I'm the one to blame.
