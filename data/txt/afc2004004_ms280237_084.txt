Maggie May:
1) The spring had come, the flowers in bloom,
The birds sing out their lay,
Down by a little running brook
I first saw Maggie May.

2) She had a roguesih jet black eye,
She was singing all the day,
O how I love her none can tell,
My little Maggie May.

3) Maggie, little witching Maggie,
Maggie singing all the day,
O how I love her none can tell,
My little Maggie May.

Seventeen Come Sunday:
1) As I walked out one May morning, one May morning so early,
I overtook a fair young maid, just as the day was a-dawning,
With me durum-da, fol-the riddle-s,
Fal the ral diddle-i-o.

2) Her shoes were black, her stockings white,
And her buckles shone like silver,
She had a dark and a rolling eye
And her hair hung down her back. (Refrain)

3) O how old are you my pretty fair maid, how old are you my honey
She answered me, quite cheerfully, "I'm 17 come Sunday."

4) I said, "My dear, will you love me, will you love me, my honey?
She answered me, quite cheerfully, "I dare not for my mammy."

5) "If you come round to me mammy's house when the moon shines bright and clearly,
I will come down and let you in so me mamma shall not hear you."

6) I went round to her mammy's house just as the moon was a-dawning,
And she did come and let me in and she laid in my arms til the morning.

7) She said, "My dear, will you marry me, it's now your chance nor never,
And if you will not marry me, then I'm undone for ever.

8) The pipes and rums are my delight as through the woods we ramble,
The pipes and drums are my delight and I'm happy with my soldier,
Lomax: Beautiful! Couldn't be beat, that.
Cox: There's getting more of it. . .I either wasn't old enough
to understand or I didn't take that much notice of it. But I
have more since -- heard things going on.
