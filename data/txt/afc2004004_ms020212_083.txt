Dear Mr. Pearl:
     Sam Hinton expected to see you at the U.C.L.A. Folk Festival
to check with you about the possibility of the Sea Islanders being
with us for the Folk Music Weekend July 5 to 7, and Mance Linscomb on
the Weekend of July 12 to 14.  In the excitement he may not have had
a chance to see you so I am writing to check with you to see if this
can be arranged.  We hope it can.
     We could take care of Bessie Jones and her group's room and
board while they are here, and $100 for expenses, and room and board
for Mance Linscomb plus $25 expenses for him.  If this can be arranged
I would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible.  As I remem-
ber it there are three women and two men in Bessie's group.  Is that
right?
With all best wishes.
Sincerely,
Max T. Krone
