To [underline] Gosnelli Field Inspectors [/underline]

We are anxious to know the rumors
that are being circulated by word of mouth
throughout the country.

A rumor is a story that has
not been officially confirmed. Or a 
rumor is often a story that 
has been officially denied. A rumor is 
hearsay; always unverified and, usually, 
untrue.

Already in this war, there 
have been many, many rumors. The 
President dealt with several of 
them in his speech last month. 
After Pearl Harbor, there was a 
rumor that our entire fleet had 
been destroyed. Later facts 
proved this rumor to be untrue. 
There have been rumors that [the] 
rubber rationing  was unnecessary. 
Here again facts have been 
presented to show how false 
the rumor was.
