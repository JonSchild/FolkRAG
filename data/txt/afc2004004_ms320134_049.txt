CAJUN CULTURE VO   -13

     A lot of young activists are teaching Cajun
now.  And here, here are a couple of young beauties who are
part of a Cajun acting company and who, during the week,
teach French in Louisiana accent to the young people of
Louisiana so, of the Cajun country.
     This is the young ladies.
     We, when I was there in 1930, when I, when I
visited the Cajun country in 1934 if you called somebody a
Cajun he might look at you in a very funny way and walk off.
People were afraid of, or ashamed of being Cajuns, low down,
it was considered a low class and uneducated.  Now you see
Cajun everywhere.  There's a Cajun, there are Cajun
bookstores and there are Cajun gas stations and there are
Cajun hob, haberdashery emporiums, and of course Cajun
restaurants.  And the centerpiece of the culture, the
football team are called, is called the [Ragin' Cajuns].
That would have been impossible even 15 years ago.  Every
year the folk festival gets to be bigger and bigger.
Thousands of people coming to celebrate  their Cajunism.  And
the, and, and during the day and at night all over town
Cajun bands play for Cajun, young Cajun dancers who are
inventing a new variation on the [Lindy] to suite the music
of their grand, more staid grandfathers.  [MIKE OFF]
