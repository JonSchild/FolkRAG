Sunday morning

Yesterday was very difficult - filled
with melancholy, burning longing for
Robin - to all of which she [never] did
not respond till 2 AM this. By then
I was so tired, so fearful, that my erection
failed, and only by manipulation did
I contrive a feeble, brief spurt which
must have left her further disillusioned
if possible, for she drempt as
follows-

In a room with a couple like
Aegisthus & Clytemnestra - sleeping in 
the same bed (that's E. & myself -
or [myse] me & my painful castrated
part] she contrives to escape by
letting them go out ahead of her.
Then Peggy Ashcroft [her idol &
the [favorite] star of the Old Vic's production
of Electra which we saw last night]
comes in & Robin is delighted.
