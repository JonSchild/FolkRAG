When I Was a Cowboy

Hunting cowboy songs in southern Texas penitentiaries may
seem a queer job and an unlikely place to find them. But I once
tried it out.

During the summer of 1933, I spent several days on the State
penitentiary farm at Angola, Louisiana. This big cotton-and-cane farm
on the banks of the Mississippi River is located about sixty miles
north of Baton Rouge with its sky-sweeping capitol built by Huey Long.

Here I was visiting Negro convicts who could sing work songs 
and ballads. These songs I recorded on aluminum discs for deposit in
the great Library of Congress in Washington, D. C.

One of the singers bore the name of Ledbetter - everybody called 
him "Leadbelly." He played with wonderful skill a twelve-string guitar,
calling himself "de king of de twelve-string guitar players ob de world."

I found that Lead-belly had memorized many floating osngs in 
Louisiana and in Texas where he had also served a term in the penitentiary. 
In truyh his guitar-playing had won a pardon from the Texas
governor, Pat Neff.

Since that day in Angola, Lead-belly's singing had likewise won
his freedom from a long sentence in the Louisiana penitentiary. Philadelphia,
Boston, and even New York have likewise heard him.

I had said to him that day down in Louisiana: "Did you ever learn
any cowboy songs, Lead-belly?"

"Yes, sir, boss, I know all ob dem songs, too."
