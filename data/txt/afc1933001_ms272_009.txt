CARLSON'S RAIDERS' SONG

Lustily singing fighting men are "Carlson's Raiders" --
the men of the U.S. Marine Corps who carried out the successful hit-and-run raid on the Japanese base on Makin Island in the Gilbert group on August 17th.

These Marines, led by Lieutenant Colonel Evans F. Carlson, USMC, with Major James Roosevelt, USMC, as second in command, are experts in death, demolition and destruction.  They can march 40 miles a day under full pack and know the fine points of knife and bayonet in-fighting.  Expert swimmers and woodsmen, the Marine Corps Raiders are schooled in stealth and night-fighting.

In keeping with the tradition of hardy warriors, like the Marines of World War I, who went into battle singing "We'll Hang the Kaiser on a Sour Apple Tree", the Marines of the Raider Battalion have a great yen for singing.

During their rigorous training schedule, the Raiders sang in songfest style for 15 minutes after "chow" each day.

The lusty battle song of the detachment which carried out the Makin raid is titled "Carlson's Raiders" and is sung to the tune of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar.  The words of the song are as follows:

CARLSON'S RAIDERS

In the memory of man there were those who were brave
And fought like the heroes of old
But none of the fame who carry the name
Of Carlson's Raiders so bold.

They were gathered from near and we gathered from far
They were picked from the best in the land
A hell raising crew that sailed the blue
Was Carlson's Raider band.

They carry machine guns like pistols they say
And a knife that was tempered in hell
And the Raiders all claim no mortal by name
Could use them one quarter so well.
