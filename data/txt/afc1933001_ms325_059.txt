Went Eight Miles
   The wagon train went about
eight miles and stopped for a late 
dinner. While the men were eating,
they continued to speculate on
the strange vanishment of Old Brindle.
Joe Goodbread remarked that
he was going to have to grease his
wagons. "Why," he said, "from the
way my trailer is pulling, you'd 
think it was loaded."
   Then suddenly he jumped up as 
if he had had a thought and went
around behind his wagon and looked
into the trailer. The wagon sheet
at the front was open, though closed
with the puckering string at the 
rear.
   "Come here fellers, Joe said, a 
smile spread over his face.

Hidden by Sheet
   The men all went, so there were 
plenty of witnesses to what some
people might not believe. There inside
the trail wagon, hidden by the
sheet, was the missing ox. He was
coiled up and sleeping like a bear
in his winter den. He was even
using Joe's bedroll for a pillow. He
had just crawled into the opening
to hide himself for a ride, the big
sheeted wagon in front of the trailer
preventing anyone from seeing
back. Joe Goodbread could not be 
mad; he was proud of having such
a smart ox. He crawled in and
gave the ox a few kicks in the 
ribs. Old Brindle opened his eyes,
yawned, got up as deliberate as a 
ticket agent, and jumped out.
   It didn't do much good to bell
some of these smart old oxen. Along
about daylight, when most cattle
are grazing, there would not be a
sound of the bell. The ox wearing
it was lying down in the thickest
clump of brush he could find or in
some gully, his head on the ground,
not moving.
   Frank Reuagh, of Dalls, the 
painter of Longhorns, told me that
when he was a boy on his father's
farm in northern Texas about 1880,
they had a pair of oxen named Tom
and Jerry. ON being tuned out at
night, he said, the yoke mates
would stay together until towards
morning. Then one would go in
one direction from the house to 
hide and the other one in the opposite
direction. When one of them
was finally found and brought in,
he could not be worked until his
mate arrived. They both seemed to
understand this and acted in exasperating
harmony.

Became Sore-Footed
   These slow, patient creatures
often became the butt of jokes by 
vigorous young men. Once on a
freighting trip to Jefferson, Texas, 
George Jackson relates, a big dependable
ox became too sore-footed 
to pull. A part of the freight was
side bacon, and one of the whackers
suggested that the rinds be cut
off a couple of sides and shoes fashioned
out of them for the ox. The
ox was accordingly thrown and
shod. Another part of the freight
was barrelled whiskey. The ingenius
whacker now had the happy 
thought of giving the ox a dram.
   "They drew a quart bottle full
of the best brand, and while one of
the boys held Old Samson by the
nose and horns, another one poured
the bottle of whiskey down his
throat. The old ox licked out his 
tongue and smacked his lips and 
got up. For a time, with his new
bacon rind slippers and morning
dram, he was as frisky as a young

   "Real travel begins when vacations
end" is generally accepted by
motorists who like their cross-
country driving. Beginning with
September, early fall has proved the
best travel period of the year because
of less highway traffic, more
moderate weather, small crowds at
resorts and reduced rates. So don't
worry that you're one of the few 
persons who hasn't had his vacation, 
or feel that you will be lonesome
on your trip.
   There are plenty others that are
just waiting for this time of the 
year to do their playing. And don't 
think the fun is all over, either,
just because Labor day has passed,
the traditional date for all vacations
to end. Instead, you should
feel lucky that you are preserved
from the perspiring, horn-blowing
hordes of the regular summertime
and the clamor of a swarming highway.
The highways may appear a 
bit deserted, but they still are there,
and they will lead you to the same
places they did before vacation end.
And most of these places have 
planned, and are better prepared to
receive their bleated guests. In
fact, with the march of time, as the
seasons have rolled by, it has been
learned of this more inviting period 
of the year. And so, with the
arrival of each day's mail there is
a large volume of literature, bulletins
and announcements extolling
post=season attractions adaptable to
their particular sector at this season
of the year.
***
   From the Atlantic shores of the
Southland along the Gulf coastal
country to the strands of the Pacific
there is offered a vast territory
of selective attraction of unusual 
interest made available by
the advent of motorized transportation
and modern highways. Beginning
fight at your very doorway, 
the great country of West
Texas presents country of unusual 
interest easily accessible within a
week-end's time.
   A close neighbor in Louisiana,
with her lovely Evangeline country,
sugar cane season, and antebellum
setting of plantation homesites,
on one hand; the playgrounds
of the Ozarks of Arkansas with its 
delightful springs and mountain
resorts midst the colorful foliage of
woodland, on another; and the romance 
of fascinating dude ranches
of the rugged mountain and semiarid
regions of New Mexico on still
another, each within contact for a 
delightful sojourn within a week's
duration. Extending one's itinerary
but a little bit, the seashore country
along the Gulf coast to Florida 
has its many attractions with the
land of the winter playgrounds of 
the great Florida peninsula close
by. Then too, there is no better
period of the year to enjoy a most
charming visit in the Great Smokie
National park of eastern Tennessee
and western North Carolina.
   If it's westward-ho that attracts
you, the entire Pacific coast country
or the major portion of the 
great Rocky Mountain region are

at your command. Just a little
more time is needed.
***
   For those who have the opportunity 
and have wanted to make such
a visit, now is the most propitious
time to see the Great Smokies. And
you will see them really at their 
best. I have had this privilege and 
pleasure and desire to offer it to 
you. In this great national preserve
one of the newest, one finds a 
wealth of enjoyment and pleasing 
recreation. Beside the trails, hidden 
in the shadow of the parks
limitless forest of undisturbed wildness
is a great natural garden of
wild flowers, changing with the seasons.
It has been officially proclaimed
by botanists, that there is 
a greater variety of flora here than
any other equal area in the whole 
world.
   More than 1000 different plants
have been listed. While in the 
spring time great masses of flowers
seem to flow down the mountain
sides in solid rivers of color, in the
autumn the great hardwood forests
are aflame in a symphony of glorious 
color - the turning of the leaves.
The written word is wholly incapable 
of describing the marvelous
beauty and wonderful coloring that
nature paints her foliage of the
wild forest. It must be seen to 
visualize or appreciate its match
less beauty.
