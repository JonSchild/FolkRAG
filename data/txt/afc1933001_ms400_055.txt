number of Negro convicts each wearing a light two foot chain
riveted into a clasp around his ankle. To keep the chain
from dragging, each man had wrapped the chain about his ankle
and stuffed the end into his shoe.

"These men work on the highways that run through thick
underbrush," the guard told me. "They are runaways. It is
easy enough for a convict to slip away into the woods when
the men are building a road through a dense forest. Today, as
you see, it is raining. We have them inside shelling peas."

And that is what they were doing - shelling garden peas
for the cannery. There were hogsheads full of fresh green
peas ready for canning, and a lot of convicts, still wearing
road chains, seated around a long table tearing off the soft 
green pods as the rain poured outside.

chained together? These men must do an honest day's work,
impossible if their bodies did not have free play. A chain
gang, as you hear the term used, means only a group of convicts
