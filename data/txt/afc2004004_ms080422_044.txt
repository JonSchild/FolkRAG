behind you, you know, and then he said, don't touch me, I ain't

away, you see.
AL: In the old days, people liked to get together and talk
about religious questions, didn't they?
Nimrod: Yeah, they did. And there was some that could see
into the Bible . . . that's how come so many different denominations. 
But the first was the baptists, and the next to come 
out, must of been about 80 years ago, was the Pentecostal
people . . . the Pentecostal Holiness, that was the first of
them to come out. . Holiness people.
AL: Could you sing us a Holiness song?
Nimrod: uh yeah. . . now here's one of the first ones, was made
in a Pentecostal Holiness way back there.
"When first I heard of Pentecost I thought it was a shame
That the bible's holy teachings should be taught in Jesus' name.
But it's real, real, yes I know she's real
Pentecostal blessing, now I know, I know she's real.
Well I started for that altar with a hungry in my heart,
Did not care for people, for the spirit had control. 
And it's real, it's real, yes I know she's real.
Pentecostal blessing, I know, I know she's real.
Some were shaking, some were dance, some were proffered on the
floor,
Some were dancing in the Spirit from the pulpit to the door
But it's real, real, yes I know she's real
that Pentecostal blessing, I know, I know she's real.
I don't know anybody else that knows that song all the way
through . . . many years ago.
