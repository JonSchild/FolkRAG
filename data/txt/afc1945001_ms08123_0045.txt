It was 5 oclock in the morning in
the year 1942 on a cold Monday morning
when a young boy had just said
goodbye to his mother and father. 
He had enlisted in the United States
army. 
As he was walking throught the 
streets many thoughts ran through 
his mind. Was he doing right by
enlisting in the arm? Was his 
mother happy? What kind of
future would there be for him
after the conflict is over? Will the 
earth have peace again?
He was kind of sad, but happy
that he might now do his part
to help keep the peace which
was here at the beginning of 
God's earth.
