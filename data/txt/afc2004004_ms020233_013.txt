see?
TL: Yeah.  Didn't used to be that way, though?
BJ: Well, it did, but I mean, if you keep -- You keep 'em away
from there so long.  If you stay in the North, you got to sen'
'em to school.  An' if they git out of school, they can come
back an' yet pick beans. [tell 'em tell 'em, tell 'em to] until, until, until it
git too late, you know, [an' need 'em] in the evenin'.  Like that.  But
they still can be makin' 5, 6 dollars a day, after they come
from school.  'Cordin' to how the beans is, see?  How high...
The potatoes are high, or whatever they workin' at.  How it
is.
[*POTATOES- CONT.*]
Workin' some mornings, look out there, see they plow the
potatas up; in the North, they plow 'em up at night.
Many times they work those big 'ol [satchel (?)] tractor plows?
At night.  An' you walk out in the field, you look as fer as you
can look.  Jus' like a mount-- Like you lookin' across a mountain?
You don't see any row or nothin'.  Don't see anythin' but potatoes,
layin' on top.  Been plowed an' they're gone.  There's your work.
It's up to you.
TL: Well, you don't work in rows.  How do you figure out where
to go?
BJ: You work in rows; you work in the grass.
TL: In what?
BJ: You work in rows.  Potatas planted in rows.
TL: Yeah, but when they dig 'em up they're not in rows anymore.
BJ: Yeah, yes they are.  The work in...
If there's two rows here an' two there.  Two here an' 2 there;
2 here an' 2 there.  See?  An' that's why you can pick -- If
you got a partner, you can stay on this side, an' then the other one (?)
