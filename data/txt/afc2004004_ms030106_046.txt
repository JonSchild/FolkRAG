Question:  Jelly, you were down in New Orleans during the
early part of the twentieth century and all the boys would play
that fast rag-time music. Show us how they used to play, getting
faster and faster.
(Piano)  They would get too fast, don't you think?
Question:  And everybody had their own style of playing?
You had yours and Tony Jackson had his and all the rest of them
had theirs?
Morton:  Oh, yes.  Everybody had their different styles.
Of course, there was some more accurate than others.  Of course,
that style I just got through playing was the style of the ones
that couldn't play very well.  They would have an inspiration
that they were doing it better if they would keep increasing
the tempo.
Question:  And what did you decide to do about that?
Morton:  Well, I decided that that was a mistake and I
believed it was a mistake because everybody grabbed the style.
I thought that accurate tempo would be the right tempo for
any tune, regardless to any tempo that you would set, fast or
slow, you should end it up, 'specially if it was meant for a 
dance tune.  So that was the idea that I decided on.  But I 
find that the slow tunes did more in the development of jazz
that is the medium slow tunes, any other thing, due to 
the fact that you would always have it to hit a note twice, when
ordinarily you would only hit it once, and that give it a very
good flavor.
