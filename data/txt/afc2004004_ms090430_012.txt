          We may now, with reasonable optimism, envision the day when every acre of our rich Delta lands will be made safe for habitation and agriculture. Our already strong main line levees will be made still stronger, and the threat of overflow from the Coldwater, the Tallahatchie and the Yalobusha and all our headwater streams will be removed and the fertile backwater area will be fully protected.
          6,600 square miles over 4 million acres of the richest land in the world! To secure this has cost much in effort, in privation and in money, but it is worth it all even as it exists today and its possibilities have scarcely been explored.
          We must remember always, however, that the Mississippi River still tears down its banks and still erodes the levees and that rain and wave must be replaced. Eternal vigilance must be exercised to retain what has been so dearly earned.
          In the last analysis, all we have in the development and progress of this alluvial empire: our homes, our farms, our schools and churches, where we may still worship in security depends upon the walls of earth that have been erected against a mighty river.
