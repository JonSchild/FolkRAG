Southern Festival -- 2
They talked about the·· code hidden in Negro
songs. How a work song would extol the power of
a man's hammer, bring out the wealth of the boss,
and then tell how the boss would come to stand
around just to see the man work. The story
was plain to the Negro worker: the white man is
getting rich on your sweat and your toil. "I'm
on my way to Canaan Land II sounded like another
religious hymn to the white slavemaster but the
Negro slaves were telling each other they were
going to escape to Canada and freedom (it was
the closest they could get without actually
singing "Canada-land".) "Steal away", not to
Jesus, but to clandestine meetings in the woods
to plan revolt against the cruel white overlords or to contact "conductors" who would
lead the escaping slaves northward to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Then Pete
led the white audience in "Go Down, Ol' Hannah" 
and had the whole place moving and swaying with song, feeling it intensely. Pete
told of having sung it at Huntsville Prison
and of virtually re-introducing it to the
men from whom it originally crame.
Mabel Hillary, from the Georgia Sea Islands, has
a gorgeous voice, tired or not. When she sang
the whole place lit up. She's so free and easy
and so damn musical. She did a "Hard Hearted
Hannah" with Len backing her up that made you
want to stand up and yell ••• Len talked about
the development of freedom songs in the North
and sang from his "Murder On The Road In Ala,-
bama", with the moving line in it: "She caught
two bullets in the brain, before we learned to
say her name." Mrs. Liuzzo, of course.

It was interesting to see the marked difference
between the new songs from those of only four
and five years ago. Eleanor Walden sang a song
written a few ~ears ago, and though it was good
for its time and style, it came from a different 
approach to life than is current now. 
Compare the "open letter" on the cover of Pete Seeger's 
"Gazette Vol.II" with the words to Phil
Ochs' "Love Me, I'm A. Liberal" to see what I
mean. We just don't seem to feel that sorry for
ourselves anymore. We'd rather fight the good
fight. Or at least laugh at it.
Notes
"Dear Sis: It seems that almost every group of
Negroes and civil rights workers that gets together is a natural chorus (and the regular
choirs are magnificent, like the one at Mrs.
Hamer's church in Ruleville.) It would be
great tor our badly depleted finances if several 
groups could be organized to travel 
around the country singing and telling about
their lives. Vivid oratory is another art
very widely cultivated among the Negro people 
of the South. I hope this idea can get
beyond the wishful thinking stage." Joe

WOODY GUTHRIE has been awarded a citation by the
U.S. Interior Dept. for "his lifelong efforts to make
Americans aware of their heritage and the land." The
award was presented to Woody in the Brooklyn State
Hospital, where he has been these many years. Woody
can still see and hear, but cannot speak and is confined
to a wheel chair..  "Dear Sis: I just re-read
Eric Andersen's 'Letter' (B'Side #68) for the 3rd or
4th or 29th time. It's so true it's amazing. He has
managed to tell the real truth about 'folk-rock' ,
something Ochs or Paxton, with their complete attack
defend, good-bad labelling, could not do." Fred Spiegel, New York •••
BARRY SADLER: Here's material for another verse
The Green Berets Rake in Gold
Saigon, April 7 (UPI)__ The Green Berets--the rugged U.S.
special forces troops who fight the Communists in the swamps and jungle-- had a good thing going. They sold bogus Viet Cong battle flags for $25 each to souvenir-hungry Air Force pilots stationed in Saigon. 
  The Green Berets hired a little old lady in a Saigon back street to stitch up the flags and then stomped them in mud and sprinkled them with chicken blood. 
   But Viet Namese police discovered 30 of the "Viet Cong" flags and arrested the seamstress. It took the embarrassed Green Berets two days to explain and get the little old lady out of jail.
