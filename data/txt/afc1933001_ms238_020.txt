Dear Alan: Along with the scrap of
manuscript from Captain Nye, enclosed
herewith, I include my apologies 
for again addressing you.
But this piece of yellow manuscript
belongs to the Library of Congress and
not to me. So I send it along.

You and the company who may
travel with you (including Darling
Corey) will have an uproarious
welcome whenever you plan to
arrive. But I think Miss Terrill
would like to know whether
or not you plan to [come] stop here
on your way to San Antonio
where you are due on the night
of May 2.
