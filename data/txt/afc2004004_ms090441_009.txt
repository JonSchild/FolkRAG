     Love is a thing that last till the graveyard.  I love my husband
right now just as hard as I did.  I feel like if he was at home living
tonight.  I just love him. . .I used to hear people say, "I'll love
my husband in his grave.," and that sure is a true word.  If he was
your husband, you sure will love him in his grave and love him
almost like he was living and just feel like you're gonna see him again some
day.  You know that's the onliest thing you have to swing on, to
pacify yourself on --"Someday I hope I'll see him"-- that's all you
can say.
