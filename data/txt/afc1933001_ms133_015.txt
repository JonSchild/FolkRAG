Miss Elizabeth B. Costello,
1130 Waverly Pl.,
Schenectady, New York.

Dear Miss Costello:

In reply to your letter of May 21st,
I regret to inform you that John A. Lomax
is in Europe and will not return until
September. I will refer your letter to him
at that time.

In the meantime, I suggest that you look
at Cow-Boy Lingo by Adams and at the publications
of the Texas Folk Lore Society, edited
by J. Frank Dobie. I am sure you will find
much valuable material in these sources.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
In Charge of
Archive of American 
Folk Songs
