them to come back empty.  Then old Roy King got in 
touch with me and told me that I could leave if I 
paid him $75.00 for every acre of land.  I told that 
bad white man what they said, and he went to see them.  
And Mr. King told him that I was a good working nigger, 
and he just didn't want me to be getting away, and at 
the same time let me know I couldn't get way with no 
raising no gun at no white man.  Well things cooled 
down and I went on and stayed.

There's one thing bout down here, most the colored 
folks know that they can't do nothing and you find very 
few of them that will do anything.  Now takes me, I'll 
take most anything off a white man excepting him hitting 
me.  Most niggers even take that.  I remembers once, not 
so long ago, down there on Issaquena Street up there near 
Fourth, there was a colored man walking down the street 
reading and not watching where he was going, and he kind 
of accidentally fell over a little white girl playing on the 
sidewalk.  Colored folks was round everywhere.  A white 
man, whose little girl it was, he jumped out of his car 
yelling, "You damn black son of a bitch, why can't you 
see where you going - round here falling all straddle my 
little girl.  I got a mind to beat your head off".  Oh 
he was ranting and cursing and carrying on.  All them 
colored folks was just standing there looking.  The man 
didn't fall over that gal tentionally and he was pleading 
and begging that white man not to beat him.  
Talking bout, "No sir boss, I didn't mean no harm".  
And the white man's wife, who was sitting there in the 
car, told him to come on and let that nigger go.  He 
left, and there was three more white mens coming down 
the street who didn't have nothing to do with anything.  
They grabbed that poor colored boy and was ganging up 
and beating him scandalous.  Nobody tried to help him, 
but there was one colored fellow who come up and he said 
right out loud, "Wish somebody would try to beat me that 
way".  Them three white men turned the other nigger loose, 
and told him - "Nigger you show is going to get your wish."  
And the started towards him, but that po' boy was a 
fighting black man.  He fought and fought and was beating 
them white fellows up so bad that they was begging for 
him to quit, but he just wouldn't.  Somebody called the 
police and that boy wouldn't stop fighting until the 
sheriff hit him right on the head with one of them 
blackjacks.  Some folks say that they was going to hang 
that nigger, but I for one knows they didn't.

When asked concerning things that he did for amusement, he said:

Well son, I ain't fit for as much fun as I used to be 
fitten for.  I'm getting kind of old now and things done
