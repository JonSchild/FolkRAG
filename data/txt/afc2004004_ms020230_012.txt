Snake aig be's in the ground.
AL:      I expect the devil hatches the snake eggs.
BJ:      Yeah, he should.  That's one job he oughta. . .
AL:     They're close kin.
BJ:      Yessuh.  That's one job he should have.  That's [true] the truth.  Hatchin'
snakes' aigs!   Hah, an' so.  Tha's jus' the onliest way -- I don't
know nothin', he, dat hatches dem but the sun or sumpthin', or
either. . . 'Cause it's a bird that lays 'er aig in the ground, too.
I think she hatch 'er own.    I think.   Yeah, 'cause I have heard 'em
fly up an' the peoples say she's s[e]ittin'.   So she musta hatch her own.
It's a mystery how God got every thing to 'cumulate an' ta, you 
know, to do -- Well, I'm tellin' ya the truth:  You talk about
sumpin', it's sumpin' to see a biddy hatchin'!   That lil' biddy
do'n' -- he, he lie in here peckin' his own way out.   Jus' peck
his own. . .
TL:     What's that?
BJ:     That lil' biddy.
TL:     Biddy?
BJ:     Chichen.  Um-hum.  It's -- He's a biddy then.   See, he's a
biddy 'fore he's a chicken.  Ha, hah!  He's a biddy 'fore he's a
chicken!
AL:     What do you mean?
BJ:      Aw, you know, he's a, aw, he's a aig -- Oh, yeah, that, that's
a question I wanna ask.   I, I think you can tell me.   I -- Wh-what
is the diffrunt between the, ah, a, a aig an' a, an' a, an' a biddy?
AL:     What do you mean an egg an' a biddy?    Do you mean a biddy
chicken?
BJ:      Yeah.
