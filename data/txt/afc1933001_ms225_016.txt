Johnny is here for a week's visit.
He is looking fine and is
making progress in the oil
game.
As you know, I always
worry when I don't hear from
you regularly. I am doing my
best to stop expecting you to
write or asking you to write.
As for replying to "all the letters"
I have sent to you or of catching
up with such unfinished
jobs as I am concerned in,
that I well know that you 
can't do. I have ceased to hope.
For every reason may I again
ask you to do the one job of
finishing the book for publication!
Lovingly, Father.
