Dear Ann + Alan
How are things in voodoo-land? Are you coming to visit us this summer? Has Ann turned into a witch doctor yet? 
My relationships with girls are not what they should be this summer so I wish to request as many brands & varieties & assortments of love potions as are available. O.K?
Your loving and expectant nephew & Cousin
Johnny
P.S. I ain't kiddin'!
