To Whom it May Concern:
     This will introduce the Puppeteers of the
Rural Commission of the American Youth Congress.
     I am happy to recommend them and their 
plays. I have worked with the Rural Commission and am familiar
with their objectives. Their plays have both entertainment 
and educational value.
