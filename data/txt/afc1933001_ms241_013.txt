Tortt the most intellegently helpful 
person for my work in the entire 
South. She knows what a folk 
song is and she knows how to 
deal with Negroes. She got me 
375 songs - some of our best -  in 
about two weeks time. If you 
can sent her a machine, I'll 
go to Livingston and work 
with her a week free of any cost 
to the Library. My judgment is 
that #100 a month invested in 
Mrs. Trott would yield very
large returns. Why cant she join 
whomever has a machine in 
Alabama? For God's sake write 
her something at once.
Affectionately
Father
[*I can be in Livingston within two weeks and stay 
â€” indefinitely or until Mrs T. can 
run the machine alone.*]
