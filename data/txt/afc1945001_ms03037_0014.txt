#4 - Missouri
Parkville, Missouri, August 9 --- This labor situation
is the worst drawback we've got on war production. Why, these
union business agents are shaking down thousands of defense
plant workers for big initiation fees and nobody knows where
the money goes. It looks like a racket of the worst kind.
If the administration doesn't do something about it, we will
have a national scandal before we are through with it. (From
the cashier of a strong country bank in Platte County, Mo.).
North Kansas City, Missouri, August 10 --- k(Comment
of a lawyer passing a huge scrap rubber concentration depot
where thousands of tons of scrap rubber is piled) -- Look
at that pile of old rubber. They've been collecting it for 
weeks. Now, why don't they start using it. Looks like it
will lay there and rot before somebody in Washington makes
up his mind what to do with it. There's something screwy 
about this whole rubber shortage business.
Kansas City, Missouri, August 10 --- The rumor around
here is that the construction of bombers at the North American
Aviation, Inc., plant at Fairfax here is way behind schedule
because they can't get a few parts. As bad as we are told
we need war planes, it looks as though Washington would clear
the bottlenecks and keep them rolling at these plants. (From
a defense plant worker).
