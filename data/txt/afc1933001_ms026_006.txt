Buffalo, 3/10/1935
Dear Mr. Strunk:
The machine came before I
left Wilton. We made about 30 new recorda[?]
from Lead Belly and as I left Alan
was working with an old Kentucky mountaineer
lady that seemed a real find.
The machine did not come "prepared"
The charges I paid out were $7 30 as I 
recall. Also will it be possible
for the Library to refund me for
the expense of 30 records at 35[cent symbol] each
$10 50 paid for from my finds?
Wilton is yet my temporary home
Sincerely,
John A. Lomax
