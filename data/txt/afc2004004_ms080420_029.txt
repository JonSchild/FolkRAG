TAPE: R-5 Appalachia 15
Ray Fairchild, cont. 

Jim: Point to it and tell us about the inlaid part of your banjo
there....
Ray: Like I say, this is a 1918, V. Gibson. You can see what I mean
by the "V", most of em just have Gibson on them. Nowmost of 
your banjos is Master Tone.... but this banjo is made in 1918, year
before the master tone came out. And that right there is the
name of my wife, my two sons, and my daughter. I had it engraved
and put in there, so I can take them with me whereever I go.
Every show I pick, I can look down and see my wife and my three 
youngins right there. That end lay, I don't know, it's just
different patterns, hundreds of different patterns, but I know
that's called the bell. And the end lay down the neck, I can't 
describe it. Like I say, hundreds and hundreds of different 
inlays in different Gibsons. But this banjo, to me, suits me
for tone, better than any I've ever had. And my daddy-in-law,
he's heard lots of banjo, and he says this one is the best one
he ever heard.
Caz: This one over here, it's got the best tone to it.
Ray: .....But I'll tell you something a woman will do, she'll buy
a record ten times quicker than a man. My record sales..85% of 
them is to women. So you might have something there. 
Jim: Tell me about the show you're going to play.
AL: Do you think people live after they're gone?
Ray: I think there be a ressurection.
