August 15, 1942

Mr. Joseph B. O'Connor
Assistant Regional Director,
Social Security Board,

New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

     In your memorandum of July 30, 1942, you asked that I furnish you with a word for word report of each rumor related to the war effort coming to my attention during the period August 3 until noon August 15.

     The following is a list of rumors repeated as closely as possible, heard by me in New York City during the above period:

1. On August 5, Mr. A stated that he had a cousin who lived in Miami, Florida, from whom he received a letter. The letter said that one day he saw four large ships on fire about ten miles off the Miami Shore. After a few hours they sank. He and his friends were interested in seeing whether these sinkings were in the papers. They read all news about sinkings but saw no notices of the ships they saw sink and that no one had any idea of how many ships were sunk because the Government was afraid to announce all the sinkings.

2. On August 7, in contact with Mr. B, he told me that he works for a large distilling company which transports molasses from Southern States to Eastern States through the Gulf of Mexico. The company had five boats transporting the molasses and all five were torpedoed and sunk. He said the word had been going around that his company wasn't much worse off in sinkings than other distilling companies.

3. On August 7, Mr. C said that he heard from good authority that as soon as General Rommel in Egypt could get enough reinforcements he would again attack the British in Egypt. The British would be a pushover for the Nazis because they have better tanks than the British. Rommel would capture all Egypt and the Suez Canel and then, what would be the use of the British or Americas fighting any more. The British and Americans would sue for peace and the whole war would be over because why should we fight any more?
