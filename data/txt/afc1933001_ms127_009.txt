Dear Professor Norris:

Your request for a list and for duplicates of the records 
has been referred to me by Mr. John Lomax.  We shall have the 
list of records and their call numbers prrpared and sent to you 
in the near future.  The preparation of the duplicates, however, 
will take more time because of the technical difficulties involved.  
We have, in the past, been able to make usable duplicates 
on aluminum discs by connecting our phonograph to the older of our 
two recording machines.  This procedure is rather tedious and the 
delicate apparatus requires the hand of an expert.  The only man 
in this division who can do such work is Mr. Alan Lomax but he is 
still away on a recording trip.  As soon as possible after his 
return, I shall ask him to prepare these duplicates and send them 
to you.

Very sincerely yours,

Acting-Chief, 
Division of Music
