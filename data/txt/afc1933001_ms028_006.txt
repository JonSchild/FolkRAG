Mr. John A. Lomax
University Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

No, Mr. Hurja has not yet returned Jackson's "Early Songs of Uncle
Sam" and our efforts to persuade him to do so are not getting us anywhere.
I have accordingly recommended the purchase of a second copy
and shall see to it that it is sent on to you as soon as received.

In accordance with arrangements made during your last visit here,
twenty-five records were sent on to Alan for transcription on April 22.
At the same time, five of "Leadbelly's" records were sent on to Herzog.
Neither lot has come back yet. As soon as either one is returned we
shall be ready to forward a second lot.

I am enclosing with this six copies of the section on the division
of music, reprinted from the current Report of the Librarians. Should
you need further copies, just let me know. We have already sent this
reprint to a number of organizations and individuals interested in the 
development of the Archive.

Folk-Song Society of the North East, Phillips Barry.
Archive of Vermont Folk-Songs, Mrs. Helen Hartness Flanders.
