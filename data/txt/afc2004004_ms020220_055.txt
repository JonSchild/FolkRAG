example to the chilren.  How to fuss an' how to argue an' how
to act.  You know?  How to be nasty.  Ya see, that's why   I was...
I reckon I was jus'  --  don't like argument.  When I hear arguments, 
[somebody is leavin'] I'm ready to leave, right then.  I don',  I don'  wanna
have no parts in it,  [ya know?] at all.   So I guess that's the
reason why.  [I jus' don',} Jus' that. I jus' don't like it.
     Some folks have told me in Miami  --  You know,  Miami's a
big city like this, ya know?     --        [an',] an' ah,  places we have
went to an'  all like that, when they started a-fussin'  I hear it,
I jus'  go tell my cousin if she wit' me, or who's ever wit' us,
I say,  "I'm leavin'."  I say,  "I ain't havin' nobody arrestin'
me."  [Say] See?...an'  so...
     And they'll,  "Aw,  you chicken;  you scared."
     I say,  "I scared?  I jus'   ain'  doin'  nothin'  to nobody an'
don't want nobody to do nothin'  to me."  Ya see?  That's they
argument.  Let me git out of it!  [I]   Out from here!
     An' sometime they won't go out from there.   An'  [I]
[have some] times I have left an'  heard talk of the house being 
pulled, see?  All like that,  see?  But I'm gone.  An'  they
ain'  gonna run me.   I  jus'   tell 'em,   say...
     "But they ain'  nothin'  gonna happen, chile!  Stay on."
     I said,  "I'm  goin'."   They can't                        your own
house                                        I'm goin' home.    Hum-hum.
TL:     Did Mama  an'  Daddy  argue, a lot?
BJ:      I never heard 'em.    
TL:      You never heard them.
BJ:       I never heard  'em argue.
TL:      Your grandparents did,  though.
BJ:      That,  that's the on'ies'   (onliest) [time that] arguments I ever heard
