Dear Mr. Denson:
After months of silence and getting no reply to my
repeated letters, I finally heard from Hugh McGraw
of Bremen, Georgia, who told me that he is President
of the United States Sacred Harp Musical Association, and
that as such he was responsible for signing the contract
for the record I am issuing.  I sent him the
contract and he has signed it and has received the
advance on the performing royalties for the Association.
As far as the copyright of the songs is concerned, they
are being copyrighted in the name of the Sacred Harp
Publishing Company.  After your letter, I no longer
feel sure about who the responsible party is here,
and to whom these royalties should be paid.  As I
have acted in good faith throughout, I do not feel
responsible for this situation, and I think that you
and Mr. McGraw had better settle the matter between
yourselves and let me know to whom they should be paid.
They will, by the way, not be coming due for a number
of months.
I sincerely regret this situation, but it would not
have come up if I had heard from you in time.
Very truly yours,
Alan Lomax
