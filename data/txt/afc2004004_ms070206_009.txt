Talk is cheap but it takes money
to buy whiskey -
Beaver In people
Wilfred O'Brien -
liar - golden boy - drunk -
genius mechanically - lazy -
wit - breaking up physically -
always pie-eyed - took
3 hrs. to wreck my car -
hates his wife & depends on 
her for money for his
drinking.
Mrs. O'Brien - The
respectable burgess - cook -
timid - her soul always twisted
in agony for fear of what her
husband will say or do -.
older than he - waiting on him
believes every word he says -
makes the family living by selling
ice cream & cakes & keeping
rooms - titters nervously at his 
jokes - afraid of him & sorry
for him - a superior person
