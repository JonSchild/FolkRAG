   There never was a ship so
becalmed as I am for a love affair.
Every woman's face looks nice
to me.  Especially one waif of
the St. Germain section who goes
very dirty with her pump straps
always suggestively about her
heels as if she had just got
out of someone's bed.  I meet
her everytime I stop in St. Germain
& now I say "hello." And I 
think more of that than all the
hungry, oppressed, bleeding
people in the world.
   This fact -- rather this cheep
summary of the bourgois pattern
of Paris -- is [the root] at the root
of all the rot of course.  After you've
swallowed this, you agree
