III. Method of Recording and Submitting Data
1. Take down everything you hear, just as you hear
it, without adding, taking away, or altering a
word or syllable. Your business is to record,
not to correct or improve.
2. Give each song and tale the title by which it
is known to the informant.
3. Wherever possible, take down several versions
of the same song or tale from the same or more
than one informant, for the purpose of checking
and comparing the texts.
4. In noting oral material please observe the following
linguistic instructions carefully:
A. Record all obscure and peculiar terms
and phrases as heard, then try to determine
their meaning and origin. Use as
many sources of information as possible,
giving the name and address of each informant.
B. In noting dialect be faithful to grammar,
idiom, typical vowel and consonant sounds,
mutilations, and corruptions. (Special
instructions for handling special dialects
will be sent on request.)
