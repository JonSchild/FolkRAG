Rumor Report
September 30, 1942

   Attached you will find special Intelligence Report, dated
9/30/42, subject - Rumors.
   Perhaps no single subject has engaged the fancy and the
attention of more information men in the government than rumors.
In fact, the study of rumors has itself been the subject of rumors.
   This first Bureau of Intelligence canvass of the subject
will, we feel, put an end to a good many half-truths which have been
circulated among us about rumor and, more important, will indicate
certain directions in which positive work can be done to neutralize
rumors.
   One additional thing this study makes plan:  "Don't talk"
and "don't rumor" are quite different as informational themes.  Careless
talking may give valuable information to the enemy.  Careless
rumor mongering, this study shows, isn't calculated so frequently to
give valuable information to the enemy.  Its danger lies in its
harmful effects on Americans themselves.
   It seems to us that the material presented in this report
may be of some value to your Bureau, suggesting discussion topics
for adult education groups.  Speeches or prepared talks of an informational
character might be prepared to show the harm that rumor
does and by repetition before numerous adult audiences these talks
might very well result in a diminution in the currency of rumors.
