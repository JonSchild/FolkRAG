Dear Mr. Lomax:

    I received but yesterday, your letter, and am indeed
sorry to learn that you are sick; but with the snap and
get-up that you possess, I am sure that you will soon be
your old time self again.

    It was a disappointment to all of us that you did not
get to visit Abilene at the time expected. I had spoken
to the hotel people at the Hilton to save room 13 for you.
Judge Pope and other friends of yours were looking forward
to a chat with you.

    I notice lying on my desk, a clipping from a newspaper
that you asked for just a year ago. I am ashamed that I
have been so remiss as to let this pass, when I could have
attended to it before. However, it is enclosed with this
note. A story that runs a bit with the Chisholm Trail.

    You know I am one of the old timers who has always
enjoyed the great work you have done in bringing to life
the stories, etc. that belonged in the era behind the doors
of the 70's. I am sending today for the new book, and some-
time soon I am going to write you a long letter, which I
think will be a surprise.

    Be sure and give my regards to the family. With best
wishes to you from

    Your friend,
    WJ Bryan
