A                     The  Red Cross
                 Today were fighting the
three most ruthless countries.
Japan is the one to watch.
Germany is still going good.
Italy is fading out fast.
There is one thing in the
world that will never fade
out and that is the Red Cross.
          The Red Cross is doing
a big job. We must back it
up with great support. They
can't give a full box of food
to every American soldier.
We can help as much as
we want. They take good
care of sons abroad. So
lets make a ful share of
faith and money to the
Red Cross.
