BJ TAPE 16, p. 74

TL:    Well, I've seen things that we call cots that are made out of
just stick an awning material.
BJ:    Oh, you mean, they all. . .That's all, ah, ah, that's a navy--
ah, a-army, a army thing.  Aw, no.  Not like that.  Now, if you
wanted ya army cot, ya could git one an', an', when ya stayed in
closed houses an' wit' all that crowd in there?   You can git ya
a army cot an' next mornin', ya fold it up.  An' that'll give. . .
TL:    Do a lot of people do that?
BJ:    Lot of 'em.  Lot of mens.  You know, jus' single mens.
TL:    Did many people sleep on the floor?
BJ:    Well, some slep' on the floor.  You know, just take their
mattress instead of gettin' a be-- a cot?  An' that keeps so
much room.   Next mornin' they fold that mattress up, ya know, an' put it
in the corner.  That keep [the] ya house from bein' so crowded, all
through da day, see?  But a lot of 'em had cots that they can
fold up.  An', an' would fold 'em up, ya see?  Some had cot they
could fold up, but you see, they settin' in places (where) they 
wouldn't be in the way.  People could pass through, see?   In
that way.  An', an' that's the crowds that's livin' in all them big
huts an' things, crowds.
        But I mos'ly, soon as I could, got in a lil' hole to myse'f.
An' have, have my own little cot or lil' bed, whatever I want, see?

sung anything they wanted to.  An' I couldn't pay attention to all
