Must remember the man [is] in
grey tweed cap, rosed cheek
bones soft voice who took
our 6ds & told us the 
facts of the camp where
2000 years ago the imperial
legions held the outer barrier
of the empire. Kipling made
me [so] pity them & really
I'm on their side today.
How absurd. God will I be
my fathers little boy all my
life.

I haven't committed myself
against what I intellectually
detest yet. If I don't I'll 
always be a compromised
soul.
