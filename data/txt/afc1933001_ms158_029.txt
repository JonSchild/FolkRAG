Dear Mr. Spivacke:

      On my arrival here last night I found a letter
from Mr. Brierley of the General Education Board stating
that they had made available for my use this summer
toward the gathering of Negro folk music the sum of $500.00.

      I assume that he sent you a copy of the letter
or notice of the action taken.

      I am writing to find out whether or not the
recording machine is still available for my use (beginning
about July 20th) and on what conditions I may use it.

1.    Am I correct in assuming that the machine will
be equiped to run on A. C. current, D. C. current and on
batteries? The latter is important as you probably know.

2.    Can the whole thing be carried around in an
automobile (Mercury 1940) sedan? and how much will it weigh?

      I have been thinking over the matter of use of the
folk songs after they are collected.

      Due to the time required to write out these melodies
and prepare them for presentation in a book etc., I believe
I should have exclusive use of the songs for a period of five
years, which would include custody of the original discs. 
In all probability, however, it is likely that I would be
ready to turn over to you a majority of the songs collected
before the end of five years â€” a number of them very soon after
they are recorded. In this I want to be reasonable.

      Occasionally I run across a melody which I desire to
use as the basis of a composition of my own. These I put
aside and work on when the inspiration strikes me. My most
recent song called I WAS THERE WHEN THEY CRUCIFIED MY LORD is
one of this kind, based on a melody I collected ten years ago.
Another will appear in the Woman's Home Companion, Christmas
issue, based on a melody obtained in Georgia where I visited
Mrs. Maxfield Parrish.
