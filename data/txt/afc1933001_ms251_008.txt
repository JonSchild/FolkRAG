Dear Alan: Your Introductory
statement for the Pan American
project was a far more vivid
and lively story than I could
have done even in my best days 
with all the possible data before
me. Some of the word pictures
of the people you had never seen
were absurdly accurate. But
you may hear from your geography!
There you limped badly
why didn't you take a map 
and read on it  the direction
Houston was from Cotulla, et
cetera, et cetera?
Poor distressed Shirley drove
away yesterday with the children
