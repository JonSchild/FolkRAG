Mr. John A. Lomax
General Delivery
Merryville, Louisiana

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Attached are the lists which Mr.
Henderson prepared in accordance with
your request. If they are not satisfactory,
please let me know and I shall
have them revised.

With regard to duplication, however,
I should like to say that in cases where
the Archive has only the aluminum records,
it might be a good idea to replace them
with new acetates. However it would
give the student's chance to compare
changes that take place in songs with the
passage of time.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
