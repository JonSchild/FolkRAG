Meet the Navy 

Meet Your Navy is a variety program broadcast from Great Lakes, Ill. This program shows you that the navy is not all hard work, but that it has some humor and fun in it too. 

The sponsors Hallmark Greeting cards, asks that you send letters or greeting cards to that boy in the service, to show that you haven't forgotten him. The best thing the boys can get is mail from home, so write often.

This program consists of music playing by the Great Lakes band, and choir music and popular music.  

The program  lasts for half a hour.
