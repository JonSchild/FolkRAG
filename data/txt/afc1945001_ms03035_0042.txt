-18- MICHIGAN

This office asked the War Library Information Service in
Detroit to check on rumors coming to the main desk of the library during
the week ending August 15. The week produced only two:
One client said to the woman at the desk August 10: "Dutch
Harbor was our Shangri-La." (Hardly a rumor)
An unidentified man on August 12 confided to the same librarian:
"England and the United States are both holding back from sending materials [*2*]
to Russia because they still distrust Communism."
Alcohol Tax Administration official: "I am told that near the
Chrysler Detroit plant the other day an air raid siren was being tested.
At the same time several airplane were overhead and the rumor started in
an apartment house were of enemy origin. It was all over the place in a 
minute and there was considerable alarm as people ran for shelter." Aug. 12.
Office Secretary: "A friend of mine showed me a letter from an officer
I know who is stationed at an emergency landing field in British Columbia.
In it he said: 'Thousands of planes are going over daily in the direction
of Alaska.'" August 10. [*[?] 1*]
Advertising Manager--"The leader of the saboteurs landing on
Long Island was an FBI agent, which accounts for the fact that the Coast [*3*]
Guardsman who first met them wasn't killed on the spot." August 10.
Leading Detroit Newspaper woman--"The district attorney who prosecuted
Max Stephan in Detroit has Nazi leanings. He told the lawyer who defended
Stephan that in the event the lawyer did not file an appeal or ask for a [*3*]
stay, the district attorney 'could." Stephan's statement that he will
never hang may be based on belief that District Attorney Lehr will find a
loop-hole for him if his own lawyer fails him." August 11.
