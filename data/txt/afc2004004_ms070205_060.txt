school, continually trembling
-it went into an electric
wringer up to the elbow and
when she sits now with her
short pipe in hand, thinking
her mouth turns grey and
weary and the lovely eyelids
droop with hopelessness-
when she [gets to] begins to think 
about her arm too much she
goes out and gets a bottle
