Boston, Mass.

Dear Mr. larkin:

Your Haitian project sounds interesting. I'll be glad
to discuss it with you and play records for you. Do you know
of the work of Katheryn Duchan, Zora Neale Hurston and Melville
Hurskowitz?. I suggest that you give me a week or two notice as
I'm often out of town.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
