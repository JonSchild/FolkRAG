3) "When you are in America some Yankee maid you'll find,
You will have sweethearts of your own more pleasing to your mind.
You will forget those promises and those to me you made,
So stay at home, love, do not roam from your lovely Irish maid."

4) When I am in America some Yankee girls I'll see,
They must be very handsome to remind me still of thee.
O there's not a flower on yon green lawn or growing in the glade
But with my mind I'll still love thee, my lovely Irish maid.

5) "It's many the foolish youth," she cried, "Has gone to a foreign shore
To leave behind the one he loved, perhaps to see no more.
When crossing o'er the Atlantic foam in the sea their graves are made,
So stay at home, love, do not stray from your lovely Irish maid."

6) Like two fond hearts together this couple did embrace,
Like honey drops upon the grass the tears rolled down her face.
Saying, "There's not a day whilst you're away, but I will be afraid,
Until you will return again to your lovely Irish maid."

The Bold Tenant Farmer:
1) One evening of late into Bandon I strayed
And bound for Clonakilly I was making me way.
At Ballinascarthy sometime I delayed,
And I wet me old whistle with porter.
Cho:
Tithery-al-dal, (3) dal dee. (2)
Dral-al-dal, (3) tithery-al-dal, tithery al-dal-dal-dee.
Tithery-al-dal, tal-taral-dal-darum.

2) I scarcely had travelled a mile of the road
When I heard a dispute in a farmer's abode.
With the son of a landlord, an ill-looking toad,
And the wife of the bold tenant farmer.

3) Hooray for the bold tenant's wife she replied,
You're as bad as your daddy on the other side.
But out nztional land league shall pull down your pride,
For 'tis able to bear every storum.

4) I spit in my fist and I picked up my stick,
And up the coach road like a deer I did trip,
I care not for bailiff, landlord or old Nick,
And I sang like a lark in the morning.
