My dear Mr. Lomax:

At the Saturday morning meeting
of the Columbia Broadcasting System Conference
in New York on March 1, I spoke to you
briefly about a variant version of one of the
songs on the program. You asked me to get
the words at that time. Here they are with 
several other songs for good measure.

Yours sincerely,
Margaret Reed
