August 3 - The first comment came from an Omaha mail carrier who
stops in the office once in a while to "visit". He is thoroughly reliable and
very sincere, and often give very representative opinion and comment. He said:
"People are becoming dissatisfied with the lack of information regarding the
whereabouts of our boys in Service. I have heard so many complaints from parents
who have sons scattered to the four winds who are now either prisoners, or who
have given their lives. I have a neighbor.....a mother who gave her only son at
Pear Harber.....she waited for five months before she heard a word which finally
came in form of an official death notification. During those five months she
actually suffered so much anxiety that when the news did some, even though it
was of his death, it was a welcome relief. Now, it seems to me the necessary
official red tape clearance wouldn't have to take that long. It all seems
ridiculous there should be so much delay. The mental anguish caused that mother
during this long delay is terrible, and I know many who are feeling that same
way about it. Something is wrong, or these missing could be accounted for before
five months' time." [*13*]
