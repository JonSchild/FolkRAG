The Nation Will Be "Listenin' In" On Virginia Tuesday Morning

A nation wide broadcast of a 
"Folk Music of America" program
will originate in Roanoke where
WDBJ on January 9 at 9:15 a. m. and
at 3:15 p. m. will "feed" the program
to the network of the Columbia
Broadcasting System. Even the
announcement of such a program must
of necessity include thoughts of the
man who has done so much for folk
music in Virginia. John Powell is
pictured in characteristic pose at
left, and especially does he smile in
just such a way whenever he is discussing
his favorite subject of folk
songs and music. The Nation will be 
"Listening in." 

The ears of America will be tuned in on 
Virginia on Tuesday, January 9, both at
the rising and the setting of the sun for
the program that will be broadcast over
WDBJ, Roanoke, and which will originate
there, will be sent out twice from 9:15 to 
9:45 a. m. for the East, Midwest, and Southeast;
and from 3:35 to 4:00 p. m.  for the
West. It is rather a portentious sign
that at the beginning of the New Year the
Columbia School of the Air has decided
that the music that the nation should hear
is that centered around the enjoyments of
the pioneer as they moved westward from
the Shenandoah valley where still can be
heard the fiddler as he plays for the 
square dances which have never quite gone
out of vogue in sections of Virginia. And
that is the reason why this particular program
will originate in this section of
America, and will feature the Galax string


perceptibly more Negroid, but with the old
fire and reckless gaiety intact."

It is in this connection that we take the
liberty of using the above pictures, even
though these men may not be heard on the
broadcast. But to write an article about
folk music in Virginia and not include
mention of John Powell of Richmond would
seem almost sacrilegious. He is pictured
in the insert, and a group of his folk
musicians who appeared at the White Top
mountain festival which annually attracts
thousands to Southwest Virginia in August
and which is directed by Mr. Powell
who is a composer and an authority on Virginia
folk music. The trio pictured from
left to right are Uncle Jim Chisholm, B.
Wohlford, and Joe Russell.

Recently there have been many Fiddlers
conventions and contests throughout Rock-
