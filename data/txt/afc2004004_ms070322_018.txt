Ernst Borneman; who turned out to be
quite nice, quite left, quite aggressive -
he involved me in a lot of discussions 
- Negro-white sex relations - relation
of criticism to art - mass created
art. Someone kept passing me
beakers of whiskey and I fear
I [was] played the lion, battering
down arguments & saying ["?"]
every other adjective. They got
me to sing - when I was much
too drunk - and I sang for
an hour with my eyes closed,
the most violent & melancholy
songs I knew. I told the
discographer sitting next to me
that I thought discography
was nonsense. This was typical
of the [an] the evening &, when I left, [all
were] hardly anyone shook my
hand. I still feel awful about it
