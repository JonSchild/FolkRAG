Mr. Cornelius DeBois                              -3-                                           September 1, 1942


d. General comparisons between what is on 
the public mind as indicated in the rumors 
and what official spokesmen are saying. 
This will help show the kind of 
information wanted or needed.  Here again it might be worthwhile to note the discrepancies of content.

e.  Sources which contribute to or counteract 
attitudes or climates of opinion influencing 
rumor production and distribution.

f.  Cases in which no sources are related to 
the rumors (except possibly very indirectly).

Enemy Sources Analysis

The possible contributions of the Enemy Sources Section 
to a study of "rumors" in the United States 
include (1) assistance in the determination of the
origin of the "rumor", (2) assistance in determining 
the seriousness of the "rumor" by furnishing information
on the part which it is playing in Axis propaganda, 
(3) furnishing instructions to field agents
on what to look for on the basis of "rumors" Axis
propagandists seem to be trying to "plant" or spread, 
and (4) making it possible to point out in an information
campaign on "rumors" that certain rumors are
of Axis origin or are given currency by the Axis in
order to discredit such "rumors".  A "rumor" study 
can aid the Enemy Sources Section to evaluate Axis 
propaganda strategy by indicating whether or not 
Axis propagandists are picking out vulnerable spots 
in the United States.  This would contribute to the 
development of materials and methods for dealing with 
Axis propaganda.

Such a study would have a number of values supplementary to those 
listed above if organized as suggested.

1.  It might be useful in piloting special field studies 
     by Intensive Surveys in areas that seem to be problem 
     areas.

2.  It might be useful in piloting General Attitude studies 
     either by national samples and interview techniques 
     or any other approach that seems most desirable.

3.  It would provide a base to aid in evaluating Axis 
     propaganda strategy.

4.  It might render services to other agencies.
