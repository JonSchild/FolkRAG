Dear Alan:

I have the answer to your letter of the 23rd from
Manie Sacks, head of the Popular Department, to
whom, as I told you, I referred the matter. He,
in turn, has talked with Paul Southard, head of
the Sales Department, who is of the opinion that
the thing would not sell enough to be worthwhile.
Mr. Sacks thinks, in any event, that we ought to
let the thing rest for a while.

I am sorry the thing thus comes to so unsatisfactory,
not to say inconclusive, a solution. As you know,
I think the idea is a damned good one and always
have. Perhaps some day I may still get the subject 
successfully reconsidered. 

Sincerely yours,

Mos
