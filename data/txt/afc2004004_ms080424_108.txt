Roll 76  Ellers  1
AL:  "We're on the front porch of Lawrence Eller in Hightower in
the mountains of Georgia, near Highwassie (??) .  Lawrence Eller
is one of the best of the all traditional banjo players and singer.
His brother Vaughn is one of the people who have still kept the
art of the mouth bow alive.  Sitting next to me is Ray McKnight,
one of Lawrences' good friends.  And I heard that he could play
the spoon, but I didn't know what playing the spoons meant.
Mr. Knight's from further south than Delanaga(??). . .
Ray:  Well, I'm down the road a go. . .Denalaga Georgia. . . . .the peace
treaty. . . .
AL:  What do you call that?  Is that buck dancing, or flatfoot, I
never saw anything like it!?   (technical)
Ray:  Yeah, that's kinda buck dancing. . .Where I got that is (?),
an idle man that'd fiddle his way out of jail with his fiddle
years ago.  He played it and buck danced.  (Unint.) twist of corn
liquor to help him get his fix. . .
AL:  Well, you never object to that sort of help yourself, do you?
Ray:  No, you ain't got any on ya, do you!?
AL:  Well, this way your arm twists around, I've never saw that
before anywhere.  Is that a propel(?) or what?
AL:  Well, it's just my way of playing the spoons.  Well, the Eller
brothers got their own sound, we allplay the mountain sound.  Still,
everybody buries you don't they Lawrence?
L:  That's right.
AL:  And you're gonna sing us a song that you wrote about the gold
rush.  Tell us about that just very briefly.
Ray:  Well, in 1828 Delanaga was the first Gold Rush for California
