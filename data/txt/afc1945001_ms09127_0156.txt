Why do people declare war?
That is what most people are wondering
today.  Those people who just can't
get along with what they have let alone
they want what their friends have.
So it is with Hitler.  He believes someday
he will rule the world, but we
know better than that.  Those are the
kinds of people we must get rid of
and rid of them fast.  The only way
we can get freedom, liberty, peace is
to rid the wolld [from] of these dictators.

There are several ways [in] to do[ing]
this.  One, is to buy War Bonds.  Second, 
Give to The Red Cross, Third, Working 
in War Plants to help make planes,
bombs etc.  These and many more are
ways in which to bring that victory
day closer to our doors.
