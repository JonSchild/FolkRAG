Dear Mr. Lomax:
Your letter reminds me of the proposal which you
and Dr. Putnam brought to our attention some time ago. I regret
that it has not been possible to take up this matter with any
likelihood of giving encouragement and this accounts for my delay
in seeing you and Dr. Putnam. A good many minor projects in
our Southern Program have had to await decisions upon major questions
of policy. If I am in Texas any time during the session, I shall
hope to see you.
With kindest regards,
Very sincerely yours,
Jackson Davis

Mr. John A. Lomax
