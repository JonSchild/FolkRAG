BJ TAPE 23, p. 22

BJ: Ah, what is this, now? Now, this is easy, too. Some
folks'll think it's bad, but it ain't bad. Ain't nothin', ain't
nothin' I'm sayin' bad.
TL: Did anybody ever guess that one that you ever asked...
BJ: Aw, well, I, they's all, we's all on a truck one day, a car
thing one day, an' I heard, I heard a man answer when some one 
asked it. I knewed it but I wouldn't say it; I was listen an'
see if they gonna answer. So one man, he studied an' studied,
the man turned an' said, "You got it." 
    Say, "What in the world I got? Nothin' come out but water."
Then that's why he thought that. Said, "It must be my eye."
     Hah, say, "It is your eye." Ha, ha, ha!
TL: Oh, no! He really did answer it right, huh?
BJ: Yes, say, "It must be my eyes, man." 
    Said, "It is your eye." Ha, ha. That was funny. I knew
it but I wasn't in the conversation; I jus' let it go. A bunch 
a rough peoples. But I had loads a riddles.
    An' what is this? Now, it sure sounds bad, but it's not bad.
Ah, "it goes in stiff an' stout an' come out limp an' greasy an' 
drippin'."...Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! It's not that! Ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha!...No, you can't think...you better take that thign off there!
You eats it.
TL: You eat it! 
BJ: Um-hum. (LOTS OF LAUGHTER; CAN'T UNDERSTAND TONI; MACHINE
KEEPS BEING TURNED OFF) It's greens. (MORE LAUGHTER) You wouldn't
a-never thought of it, would ya? Ha, ha, ha! That's what it,
that's what it is, greens.
TL: Are greens supposed to be good for your bowels?
BJ: Huh?
