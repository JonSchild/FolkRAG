October 12, 1940

Dear Father:

I am going to cast this letter on the rough waters
of life of this United States and hope that it finds you.

I suggest that if the recordings are not completely
up to standard, that you let us know and we can send you a
machine that you know better how to handle and are familiar 
with. It's already to go whenever you are.

I've just got back from New York where I did my first
School of the Air broadcast and several others also. Spent
the night with Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt in Hyde Park. She's
a very nice lady. I'm working my head off and I'm delighted
to know that you're having such good luck.

Your letter to Mr. Weisner has just come and we all
think that you should change to 78 and that you should send
for the other machine if you feel that you need it.

Give my best regards to Deannie and hurry as we're
anxious to see you again.

Much love,

Alan
