Topeka - August 13, 1942 (cont'd)

"I'm very confident we're going to win this war, but it may take a long time. 
Of course, no one knows exactly what is going on, but it sure looks bad now. 
We're going to be a long time in this fight."

"There seems to be a lot of confusion in Washington these days. We're going 
to have to cut out all the talking and get down to business and win this war."

"The soldiers out here were on a practice hike last night. They were getting [*1-*] 
used to sleeping on the ground."

"Jobs are sure easy to find these days. Anybody with any training can get a 
good job these days."

"You can't find a negro to do anything these days - they all have government 
jobs."       [*5-*]

Topeka, Kansas - Friday, August 14, 1942

"All the young men of this town have either gone to the army or navy or a 
war job."

"We have to win this war, whatever it takes."

"This war won't last long - it will be all over before some of these new plants 
are finished."

"There won't be an end to this war for years. All the able bodied men will be 
in it before it is over."

"You can't get any help these days. The army or the war plants has everybody."

"Gas will be used in this war as a surprise feature when Germany gets desperate. 
It is inevitable and just a matter of time. It will be used as a last resort 
and the results will be terrible."

"The navy boys go because they want to - the army boys go because they have to - 
in the draft."

"Officials in Washington seem to be more confused than the people. They don't 
seem to be able to agree on what to do about anything."

"I don't get this night shift work - most of the time there is nothing to do, 
it's too hard to stay awake."
