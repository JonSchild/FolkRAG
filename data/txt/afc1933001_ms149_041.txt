My dear Mr. Lomax: 
Thank you for your very kind comment 
on our first three volumes. It gives us pleasure to be 
able to inform you that the History of Music Project, 
having obtained sponsorship from the City and County of 
San Francisco, has resumed operations for its second 
period of approximately nine months. We are continuing 
with the preparation of the monographs as listed in the 
enclosed schedule.
It may also be of interest to you to 
know that we are putting out a special edition of the 
San Francisco Songster, a collection of the ballads of 
the gold rush era to be used in the local public schools 
as a supplement to music study. When completed we shall 
be pleased to send you copies of this special edition. 
Regarding information on "Old Put" - 
we are sending you data uncovered in the course of our 
research for the Songster. Should we be able to discover 
additional information we shall forward it.
Thank you again for your interest 
in our series.
Very truly yours,
Cornel Lengyl
