Kansas City, August 6 ---- The government's giving 
too much house to these dollar-a-year boys.  What they ought 
to do back there is spend some money and hire the real 
brains of the chemical and engineering field the same as 
big business does when it wants to do a job.  We got too 
many theorists back there and not enough real technical 
experts.  That's what is the matter now in this synthetic 
rubber row. They don't know what they're doing back there. 
It would be cheaper for the public to hire real brains than 
to rely on dollar-a-year men who can't get the job done.   [*(11)*]
