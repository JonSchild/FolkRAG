Dear Alan:
It would be great to have the use
of a recording machine next chance I get to 
visit Beech Creek. Let me know all the details.

We may want to get at least one
full Jack Tale verbatim in the Houghton Mifflin
book.

I wish I could get lined up to do
a lot of collecting this way; but right now 
there is a farm to see after. Is there any
chance that after the war there might be any
jobs of this sort, for the Library of Congress
or the Archive?

The new MS is getting along. Am sending
off some samples today before we go too far. The 
process of deleting dialect and keeping the idiom 
is ticklish.

What's the war doing to your activities?

We're trying to find the way to take
Horton Barker to "the men in service". He has some
items that would go over big in the camps! We've had not much luck learning how to go about this.
