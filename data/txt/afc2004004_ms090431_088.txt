Fisk. 15. 10. WILL STARK.

Pray from huntin the other day
This mornin.

Crawfish back in, back in the hole
This mornin
Crawfish back in, back in the lake
This mornin,
Crawfish back in, back in the lake,
Ain't you scared of the henlike the drake?
This mornin.

The hen say, "Drake, let's take a little dive
This mornin."
Hen say, "Drake, let's take a little dive;
The crawfish over on the other side
This mornin."

What did the hen duck say to the drake
This mornin?
What did the hen duck say to the drake?
"No mo crawfish in this lake
This mornin."

She flapped her wings and away she flew
This mornin,
She flapped her wings and away she flew
This mornin,
She flapped her wings and away she flew;
Crawfish over on the other side
This mornin.

I got that mixed up.

DIDN'T HE RAMBLE?

A man had a little ram;
His name was Idle Joe.
Its wrinkled round his horn
And just forty miles or mo.

He rambled, didn't he ramble?
Didn't he ramble til theman cut him down?

The horn that run back growed
And reached the sky.
An eagle built a nest
For to hear the young ones cry.

He rambled, etc.

The ram had four horns to come from the br at (?)
Two come out of his forehead
And the other two out of his ham.

He rambled, etc.
