Dear Sirs,

Regarding the Broadcast on the
Scottish Programme "Folk-Music" on Friday
30th Nov. at 4 P.M. I was interested in
their opening number "The Day we gaid to
Rothesay O'."

My father who was quite a good
singer used to sing this song over
Forty years ago at various concerts.

The words & chorus that was sung
on Friday are not the actual words, so
I thought I would write to you & 
offer you the words & chorus.

There are 5 verses & chorus, so if you 
are interested, you might drop me a
short note.

I am
Yours Faithfully
Robert Deas
