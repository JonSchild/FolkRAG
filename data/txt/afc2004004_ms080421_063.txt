come back out and walked thru the woods come home to tell someuns
about it.  It's getting late and we think goin' back down you know
to get 'em.  We went back two days later than that and I guess
the 'coons or somethin' had got it.  But each one had got the 
other one's tail, and swallowed it, and they swallowed it up and
they both was dead, both snakes was dead.  When we moved over
where (unint.) now, it's like my sister still there, Hattie,
. .there were a lot of snakes around there.  I growed up around
the house, I bought it in '52.  There had been anybody out there
for years and the black snakes done took over.  We were in the 
bed sleeping, and something got on my feet cold, cold as kraut.
I said to (unint.) in the name of God do you hear and she said
nothin' and I said "there's somethin' in there."  She said "ain't
nothin'" and I said "sure it!"  I turned the light on and what
do you reckon fell, a big black snake down from my feet in the
bed!  I took him by his tail, you can take 'em like a whoop, and
you come up this way and you jerk 'im and break his neck.  And
there's quite a few black snakes there.
Hattie:  You know there's one that got in my house, one day in the
spring, a black snake.  I heard a dish falling and I went and
he'd climbed up onto the sink and (Unint.) and I went and shouted
for a man (unint.).  I got a shot gun, and a snake killer and
a hoe . . .(unint.). . .I finally got to the snake killer but it didn't
do any good.  I said, "you take the hoe and hold its head down
while I take the snake-killer out" and he couldn't hold it.
(unint.) We hunted and hunted and found it again.  I stuck snake
killer in it, got it out in the yard and he shot in.  It was
about a yard and 4 inches long, and about this big around!. . . .
