p. 22     "If folk-lore is popular
error and the same popular error
is to be found in widely seperated
parts of the world, then error would
seem to be consistent and the
science of folk lore is the science
of error."

see pp. 23 ff. for definition of
folklore and the history of
folklore.

There is much wise and incisive thinking in
this book dealing with the relations between
folk-motifs & pschological
& fantasy motifs.  The basic approach is
psychoanalytic.  Where he wanders afield,
it seems to me, is in historical interpretation
- no social or economic
processes taken into consideration.
