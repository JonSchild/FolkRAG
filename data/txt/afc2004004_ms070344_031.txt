said Mrs. C. won't fit to
sing - but indeed she was &
all afternoon - one of the finest
sweetest tune rememberers of the 
world - with eyes like two blue
skies & her sous  with him in the
house not wanting to leave
& get married, well knowing  no
other woman could come up to
her.  Outside a holly bush & the
40 yr old [?] climbing to the 
top for Robbie's holly -

Recorded till late at night.
Mrs. Cronin at her own house,
then John Connell (the shy farmer)
and Sean O'Sullivan & Dermot
O'Riordan in the parlor of
the hotel.  The afternoon was
golden folksong at the
ancient hearth - the evening was
stiff & artificial in the Traveler's
[Power?] Hotel.
