[This song]
Theoline asked me repeatedly to play this record for her
and I could not understand why she was so much interested
in this particular song. At last some one let it slip that
this song is a spacial one for this particular ceremony.
I confirmed [this with several] statement by asking several
other people and cam to the conclusion that it was only
natural for the mombo, who seems to be the only person who
knows much about the ritual order or significance of the
vaudoo songs, to be more inteerested in this song than all
the others that were sung [at this] during this ceremony.
I was led by Elize               , one of the hounsi for whom
Theoline, the mombo, seems to depend for her singing.
