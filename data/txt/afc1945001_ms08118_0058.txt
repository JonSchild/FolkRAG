Joke

Two bucks privates met a major.
After passing him, one of them suprisinglly
haulted off and gave him a wallop
on the chin. As the major staggered
to his feet the other Private let him
have it, and down went the major
again!
After having rested in the guardhouse
for sometime, the two privates were
brought before the major. Why did
you sock me?" he asked the first offender.
When you passed me, you stepped
on my bunions. I saw red and 
forgot who you were, Sir."
