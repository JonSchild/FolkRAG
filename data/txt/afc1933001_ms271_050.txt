Trumpet D    Sing On Brother 1
I had a dream the other night, sing on, brother, sing!
A - bout a war we've got to fight, Sing on, brother, sing!
I dreampt the devil came to me
And he woke me up from out my sleep,
Here's what he say to me:
"Sing in bro - ther, sing!"
Chorus
You bet -ter get ready, buddy,
You bet - ter get read  - y, bud - dy,
You bet- ter get read - y 'cause you
know you've got to fight
may be called to - night. S
