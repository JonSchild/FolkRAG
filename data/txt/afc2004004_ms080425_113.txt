uh, I liked it and they always seemed to like me, and they, uh, when I
decided to retire, I, uh, I wouldn't tell 'em--I knew that they wouldn't
let me, they wouldn't let me go if I told 'em, so I just quit.
     Tell me just one more thing. How do you feel when you're in a square
and conducting--how does it make you feel?
     You know, you feel good, you, you, you feel happy, you can see all the
audience, you can see people lookin' at you. I know about what they think
about me, you see, and I do my best. If you've ever seen me direct
a song, you, you know how I get into it, and I just do, do the best that
I can . . .
     How do feel about it . . .
     When he's up there?
     Yeah.
     Oh, it thrills me when he gets up there. I love to see him lead.

Anything else that you want to say?
