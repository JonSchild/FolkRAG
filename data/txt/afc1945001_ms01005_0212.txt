Rumors

First, it has been reported to me that in Washington at
the Thursday night prayer meetings of the Baptist Church at the
Chevy Chase Circle, the leader spreads rumors. He is a source of 
all sorts of anti-British material, and my informant, Mrs, William
Galvin, urges that something be done about it. I am herewith referring 
it to you, for referral to an appropriate action agency.
The Working Committee on rumors does not feel that it is appropriate
for Bureau action at this time.

Second, the Working Committee established through notification 
Serial No. 11 and drawn from Panel A wishes to defer a full
report pending the return from the field of the second rumor study.
This is a Special Services rumor study. Inasmuch as Allport's criticisms 
are in part not relevant to the present study and since policy
discussions are at present under a way, a full analysis with recommendations 
at this time seems inappropriate.
