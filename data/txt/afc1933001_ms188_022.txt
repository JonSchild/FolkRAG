Reliable Jubilee 
Four To Sing At 
Wheat St. Church 
Back in 1936, four young men 
were rid'ng along the Burbank 
Drive Highway, humming and 
singing, and then suddenly one of 
the young men found a bright idea 
buzzing through his head. 
"Let's organize ourselves into a 
quartet," he suggested. 
The suggestion was a good one. 
The other young men accepted it, 
and today, we have the new very 
popular Reliable Jubilee Four 
Quartet. 
This quartet, which had its beginning
in an automobile on the 
outskirts of Atlanta, has made 
quite a name for itself. The singers 
appear regularly on radio
station  WATL and the Mutual 
Broadcasting System and are in a 
big demand for church programs. 
After so much success, members 
of the quartet think it it high 
time for them to do a little celebrating. 
The celebration will be held this 
Wednesday night at 8 o'clock in 
the main auditorium of Greater 
Wheat Street Baptist Church at 
which time a quartet convention 
will be terminated 
Several prizes will be given away 
including six turkeys and six baskets 
of groceries. 
The quartet has made quite a hit 
on Bond Fair Of The Air, selling 
approximately $9,000 worth of 
War Bonds and Stamps 
Joe Sharlow is manager of the 
singing group.
