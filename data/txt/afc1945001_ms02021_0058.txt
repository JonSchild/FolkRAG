Differently stated the rumor is heard that the Administration
jockeyed Japan and Germany into such a position that war
was inevitable.  Undoubtedly there are large groups of people in
cities such as Denver who do not appreciate the fact that years
of preparation and effort were made by Japan before action commenced
at Pearl Harbor.  They do not appreciate the fact that German
newspapers were stating that President Roosevelt was endeavoring
to line our country with Russian communism and Bolshevism before
Germany declared war on this country.

(In our opinion, there are numerous wealthy persons who
hate so intensely the thought of being deprived of their present
comfort and wealth because of increased taxes, etc., that they have 
become bitter and are taking it out on the Administration by
criticizing the country in every possible way.)

"Economists keep harping on inflation but there won't be
inflation until after the war is over because all he money from
taxes, forced savings, etc., will be syphoned off by the 10 percent
bond plan", according to the rumor of a Denver investment broker,
heard at Troutdale, Colorado, August 8.
