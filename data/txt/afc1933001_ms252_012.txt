Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear father:

Your trip to West Texas has been approved. I append the budget.

6,000 miles at 5 cents a mile            $300.00
60 days at $5.00 perdiem                    300.00
100 discs at 75 cents a disc                    75.00
15 duplicates at $1.75 each                   26.25
4 needles at $4.00 each                          16.00
Miscellaneous                                           75.00
                                                                $792.25
20% for laboratory expenses               158.45
                                                                $950.70

Be sure that you don't undertake this necessarily arduous trip unless
you feel able to, and if you don't feel like going it alone I am sure that John
Brooks or Frank Dobie could dig up a student who would be glad to go with you
and help you out. As to payments you can send us a voucher each two weeks if you
like, attatching thereto receipts signed by the singers for all such expenses
and a short statement of what you have done up until that point. Perhaps even better
plan would be for you to sign the enclosed vouchers before a notary after you have
filled in the totals for each section of the trip and leave Mary Rogers the job
of properly filling in the various items of the total from a statement attatched
to each voucher. This procedure will, I think, get you paid promptly and without
any complications, but don't bother to submit expenses of miscellaneous character
without receipts, because they simply won't be paid, and in addition they will
delay the whole process by weeks.

With the list of contacts that you already have and with the others
that you can develop if you take your time in towns like Alpine and so on, the
results of the trip should be extremely valuable. If you are too busy to take
notes on the trip, simply turn the machine on and record your impressions at
33 r.p.m. as you go along. Dobie mentioned that Sandy Morris is the greatest of
all cowboy singers, but Bess reports that you disagree with him. Cancel that. 
appointment. Write me at once about your needs for records and needles and just
for safety purposes have the machine looked at by the Dallas Presto man and get him
to bill the Recording Laboratory at the Library of Congress.

Bess, to my great sorrow, is about to leave for New York and Detroit.
When I said we had all been mistreating her, I meant simply that we had not provided
her with enough clothes recently. Much love from both of us.
