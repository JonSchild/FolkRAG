Just' cain't he'p it.  Hah, got meat...hah...Mama be sendin'
baskets an' boxes an' packages of things to peoples,  jus' givin'
'em milk an' givin' 'em butter.  She fuss about it.  She fuss
about it.  "I ain't gonna do it no mo'."  Next time they come an'
ask for it, she go an' get it again, heh!  Ha, ha, ha!  An' some times,
ya know, when she ask some of 'em to he'p her milk the cow or 
he'p her clean out the lot, things like that, they ain't got time
or they, sumpthin', excuses.  But yet they come for milk an'
butter.  An' Mama'll puff up then:  "I ain't gonna give 'em no
more.  The ol' lazy so-an'-so.  [I don't like...Don't] I'm not gonna give 'em..."
When they come back again,  "I'll give that ol' fool some milk.  I
know she needs it."  Ha, ha, ha!  She'll do it anyhow.  She's still
that way.  She says she ain't gonna do it, an' then go right on an'
do the same thing.  Give it.  Especially give it, an' lettin' have.
Always did.
     An' then, we knew someone is sick, an' got chirruns, or
ain't got chirruns, or whatnot, an' need things, they go by
night or by day, they run over in them kind, carryin' sumpin'.
Mama's still that way now.  She cooks that soup an' things an'
sen' it to diffrunt ones.  People love it.  All they wanna know
is, "Tell Miss Frances to cook me some soup."  She can cook that
stuff ya call home-made soup.  Oow, Lawd!
