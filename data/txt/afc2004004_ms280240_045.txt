some of them that could read your fortune.  Fortune tellers.
I met them...oh, I've met them - in my travels.  Oh, yes.
Got my fortunes read fro' them.
(How did it happen Jimmy, that you did never get married,
or have you beein married?)
I don't like to meet nuns....the nunnery.  I don't like to
meet the nuns.  I don't like to meet them because they're,
they're very unlucky people.
(I know, but I don't understand how you, yourself, never
got hitched up.)
Well, I don't know, I do do'nt know how it was I did'nt get
married, that ....I've been very near married - many's the
time, but I was'nt so, so far advanced as get tied up.  I did
get very near tied up, at one time.  That girl - went away with
another boy, you see, and I knew it was lost then.  Did'nt
get much chance of doing that.  Never thought...never come
across my mind to do that.  Never thought of getting married, no.
You always could correspond with women easy enough, without

Oh, yes. Yes. I liked the Canadian women too - they were
good - the Canadian women.  It was French...It was a French
province, you see, they were all French Canadians there.  It
was very good them that was there.  them that
I come across was very good.  Of course you get good and
bad all over the world.  I expect you will do.  But the ones
that I come across was very good and some of them pretty - 
tricky, too.  Very bad, too but...i never got into contact
