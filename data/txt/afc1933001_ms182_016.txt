My dear Alan: -

You & your father are
alike - in that you "get your man"!
I tried to avoid a drive of some
35 miles for "Aunt Harriet" because
I'm running my thread-bare tires
on borrowed time - I know, where
ever one blows out - there I'll
squat for the duration - & then some!
But knowing you to be a chip off
the old block (wouldn't he die at that?)
I decided I'd go sooner or later so
yesterday aft I notified the garage
man as to general direction, also
about the time I should be coming
back - then went forth! Aunt Harriet
had moved - at least I hoped so
when I found her house looking as
tho it had been blitzed - she was
a mile from Hamner, but the postmaster
knew the man whose place she
is on & should have forwarded her
mail, but not being interested he didn't.
