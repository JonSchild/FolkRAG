ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS
In this general discussion emphasis has been placed upon the
need for care in rumor control programs and also special emphasis upon
the forms for direct counter action. Experience has shown that well-intentioned 
activity may sometimes be [completely] wasted. In spite of the 
care which was taken in trying to squelch the rumors about the "Eleanor
[groups] Clubs," reporters still find people saying something like "Well, maybe
there aren't any Eleanor Clubs but there sure must be something."
The search for authoritative facts frequently leads the column
to the person who must necessarily give one type of statement. You would
not expect a bank president to say that it was unwise to put money on
deposit at his bank, so that calling in the banker or the treasury official 
on some of the savings bank and war bond rumors is not always the
[safest] wisest thing. To quote from a letter received by a newspaper column
which had dealt with rumors about food at the Army camps may prove
illuminating:
The Service Club
--------Training Center
Camp --------, State ----
September 12, 1942
Gentlemen:
"I have seen several articles in your paper
dealing on various phases of the Army mess. In
a great many instances the officer is undoubtedly
correct in his statement about ["]enlisted men's
mess,["] but my experience serves to confirm the
above rumor.
