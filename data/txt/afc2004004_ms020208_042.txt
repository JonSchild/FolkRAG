had nothing to support her, and I just went on, and I finally forgot
about her.
A:  Well, in those days in the country, didn't the young man and the
women have their pleasure together?
R:  Oh yes, oh yes, we went together, you know.  Of course, we were so
busy until we didn't have time like the young folks do now because we
worked every day.  We'd only see each other Saturday evening and on Sunday.
[*No promiscuity*]
A:  In those days it wasn't considered so wrong if you slept with a
girl, was it?  Out in those country districts?
R:  Oh, man, there was a place down in there you'd go, but, oh, out there
in our settlement, if a girl was caught with a man, she never was
counted no more.  No, she was out of society.  Why those old folks--
if you was caught with a man, and it was known, she couldn't go with
none of those best girls no more.  Them mothers wouldn't have that;

them girls, why them best girls wouldn't go with us, why, we'd
have to slip down there at night.  Yeah.  We had a group of em, though,

and [every]anything you want to.
A:  They weren't professionals; they were just a different class.
R:  Yeah, we just had classes.  Just like the white folks, you know, we has

don't think that you were gonna spoil a girl and getz away with it,
I mean one of themgood girls; you wouldn't do that, no sir.  Why,
if you wasa pretty good kind of a boy and everything all right, when
they found it out, you'd just go marry the girl.
A:  But they saw to it that you married her.
R:  Oh, man, yeah.  You had to marry that girl or die.  They'd kill
you, that's all.  Just had to do it.
