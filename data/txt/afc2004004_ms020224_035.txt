BJ TAPE 9, p. 33

"I been down so long,
Risin' don't cross my mind;
When th' sun go down,
I don't know just where I'm gwine. . ."
Sittin' there, lookin' across the lil' street, ya know.  An' I just
sat there an' looked at that chile!  Like a chile that wasn'
playin'.  She didn't know; ain't known yet; but that thing grieveded
[at] me.  You know, I wanted to keep her more there, if I could, ya 
know?
     I did keep her until he got some place for her in Georgia,
his aunt, from Georgia, ah, come up -- somewhere in Georgia --
come up an' got her.
     But that was a pitiful thing, just to say, you know, hit
was real, ya know, what she was sayin', whether she understood it
or not.  But she was just sittin' in there an' then lit right up on
that one verse:  "I been down so long/ 'Till risin' don't cross my
mind."
AL:  Was she a nice girl?
BJ:  Um, very nice, um-hum.  She cleaned up for me an'.
AL:  Intelligent?
BJ:  Um-hum,
jus' very nice.  An' I wanted to keep her, but you know, he wanted
me to jus' keep 'er 'till he could git. . .
AL:  And these people had just put her out in the street?
BJ:  No, they have just been off, you know, they was ballin'
peoples an' they just go off an' if she ain't in at the house they
don't try to look for 'er.  If she ain't there, they. . .Know, you
know what I mean, just like if she be out and then, then, they
treat 'er so bad.  She had to wait 'till everyone of the chilren
in that house ov' there eat, before she could eat a mouthful. 
An' what they left, they got, an' that's all.  An' so that['s] what.
