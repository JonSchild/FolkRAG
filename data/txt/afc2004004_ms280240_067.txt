TAPE 75...JIMMY MCBEATH...LONDON NOV.14, 1953.

Jolly Carter Lad:
1) I crack, crack goes my whip, I whistle and I sing,
I sit upon my wagon, I'm as happy as a King
My horse is aye sae willing, and for me, I'm never sad,
There's none can lead a jollier life than Jim the Carter lad.

2)I used to sit upon me wagon and hear my father sing,
As merrily as his whip would crack as merrily did he sing,
Crack, crack goes his whip, he whistles and he sings,
I sit upon my wagon, I'm happy as a king,
My horse is aye sae willing, and for me, I'm never sad,
There's none can lead a jollier life than Jim the Carter lad.

Lomax:  Where's that from, Jimmy?

McBeath: Belongs to the North of Scotland, From Perthshire originally.

Lomax:  Where di you learn it?

McBeath:  I learned it in in Bannf.

Lomax:  Now what about Eppie Morrie..

Jimmy sings fragments:

Haud awa' free me, Willy,
Haud awa' free me,
Before I'll lose my maidenhead
I'll try my strength with thee.

He kissed her on the shoulder
And held her shivers twa,
But aye she grat and aye she spat
And turn-ed to the wall.

Lomax:  What about the song you were diddling the other night...

1) It's toorna-ripp-ed-a toorna-my goon-a (3)
Did ye ever see such an ill-trickered loon?

It means that the fellow got - they started fighting - the girl and
boy, see - and he tore her gown off her back.  He tore it to
ribbons and she went home and told her mother that the boy had torn
the gown off her back.  It was ripped, torn, tattered.  The ill-
trickered loon, means he was full of tricks - supposed to be bad,
coarse behaviour.  Trickered  -- he was bad, see.

Lomax:  When would you sing a song like that?

McBeath:  It's noa ballad.  It's like a kid's song, a diddling song.
