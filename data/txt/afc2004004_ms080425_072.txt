(MRS)  perfectly happy. . .and some of our best friends there. . .
AL:  Did you get a chance to talk to each other and get acquainted
in the recesses and stuff like that?
MRS:  Always, yes.  But I didn't meet him that day he saw me.  I met him
on the 4th of July in Carrolton.
MR:  I started arranging to meet her.
MRS:  He got one of his cousins to introduce us, and from then on we
tried to go to the same singings so we'd see each other.
MR:  Our daddies were strict and during the hours the singing was on,
you stayed in the church.  Recess was when you got to socialize.
AL:  Hold hands and walk down to the spring. . . .
MRS:  Walk to the spring, that was very popular!
MR:  I remember the old (??) near where our grandparents are buried. . .
the well was three or four hundred yards from the church and that
pleased the young people very much!  It wasn't any trouble to get
someone to walk back to the well with you!
AL:  And the girls were all waiting for that to be asked.  . . .by the right one.
MRS:  That's right.  I imagine there were quite a few people who met
that way, don't you imagine?
AL:  Do youall ever sing together at home?
MRS:  We sing when we start to singing and when we leave we sing on the
way home til we give out!
AL:  What is one of your favorite songs, could you give us a little bit of it?
MR:  I  can easily tell you some of my favorites.
MRS:  I always say I like 'em all.
MR:  318, "Present Joys" is a favorite of mine.  101, "Canaan's Land"
is a favorite of mine, 298 "Providence" is a favorite of mine,
405 is a favorite, 343 "Happy Home", that's a few of them I like,
