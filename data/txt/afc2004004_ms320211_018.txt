LOMAX  I had imagined that, that
Storyville or the area where, where, where vice was
permitted was, were full of dance halls and bars and so on
and so on.
ROSE  Not full of them.  There were. . . .
LOMAX  Where a lot of musicians could get
work.
ROSE  Well, there were some musicians
could get work.  But when you say a lot, I'm talking about
related to the entire pool of New Orleans musicians.
LOMAX  Well how big was that?
ROSE  Well let me tell you. . .
LOMAX  Okay.
ROSE  . . .exactly how that was.  In my
book, in Storyville, in, in New Orleans Jazz, the family
album, I'm documenting 1200 jazz musicians.  All right?  Now
there were never more than 30 jazz musicians working at any
one time in Storyville.  The, there were only (CLEARS
THROAT), at any given time, four cabarets where they would
be playing.  Now I'm excluding piano players.  Now most of
the piano players, however, did not play either jazz or 
ragtime mainly.  What they played mainly was light classical
music.
