F. N. Female

"I heard a person say that in World War I the
negro was always put on the front line when
it came to really fighting, and that the negro
always did a good job of it. The same thing
will probably happen in this war where the
colored are mingled with the white."

I also heard a person say that "the negro
was always thought of as being rowdy and
loud but when it came to fighting, he
really showed his stuff."

I heard a person say that "it is a good
thing that America was brought into the
war because after it's all over everything
will be better for the negroes all of the way 
around." "The war is going to bring out the
negro and his works considerably."
