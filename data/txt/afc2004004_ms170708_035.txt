Kennedy: A ship is it? Is it a ship, The Dolphin?
Cox: Yeah, a ship; a ship's what I'm talkin' about.
Kennedy: What, it's not like this crocodile one, is it?
Cox: Oh no, that's a. . .this is different to that. (pause)
Now we had not been a-sailing, scarce thirty leagues or more
Before we spied a large French ship an' down on us she bore.
She hailed us in French, my boy, sayin', "I pray whence you come down?"
"We just come down from Liverpool town, an' The Dolphin is our name."
"Are you a man o' war, sir, or pray what may you be?"
"I am a saucy privateer, an' that you soon shall see.
We will box around your foreyards, an' let your ship lay to,
Or else the contents of my port I'll fire, I'm sure it will sink you."

So broadside for broadside, which caused them to surrender;
The rattlin' of the royal yards come rattlin' down like thunder.
We shot them from their quarters, they could no longer stay,
Our guns bein' smart, an' we played our part, an' we shewed them Liverpool play.

So now we've taken this large French ship,                                    we bore,
We fired a shot for our sweethearts an' the girls all on the shore.
We lowered down the French colours, let fly the red, white an' blue;
Success to the jolly old Dolphin an' all the jovial crew.

Kennedy: Lovely.
D. Kennedy: Very good. That's a lovely song.
Kennedy: A very good tune, too, a sort of rollicking. . .
Cox: (laughs) An' there's another - another old song I used to sing
about. . . that's a long one, that was.
"Did you ever hear talk of a good luck ship,
Di you ever hear talk of the commander's name."
That's how it start off. That's another old sea song.
Kennedy: You nver heard a sea song about Henry - what is it,
Henry Mart-. . .
Cox: Yes, I have.
Kennedy: Martin, is it?
