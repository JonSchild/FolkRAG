11.

You say you are a Christian
And your heart is pure
But what makes you carry your neighbor's name
From door to door?

God give you the gospel
And give it free,
But the preachers now can't carry it
Without a salary.

Some folks seek my Jesus
And do not seek Him right
They pray a little in the day
And frolic all the night.

You say you've been converted
You ought to quit tellin' lies
Quit drinkin' so much whiskey,
Live more civilized

Preacher in the pulpit
Preacher so loud and bold;
He's a-preachin' all about money
Nothin' about savin' your soul.

Chorus

Do you call that religion, O, no,
Do you call that religion, O, No,
Do you call that religion, O, no,
You dont 'alize your name.

Your brother borrow your money
He promises shore to pay;
When he see you comin'
He turn some other way.

(Chorus)

When de preacher was a preachin' while ago,
Sister was about to shout;
Now deacon wants a little collection
You got your lips poked out.

When the preacher comes to the sister's house
She scarcely rests his hat
Till the preacher asks the sister
Where is your husband at?
