charming work - a job that
will surely put him on 
the map in the Eastern

When the final copy for
This Singing Country is in
wont you please send
me a postal, a collect
wire, a radio-gram, or
air mail visit - anything -
so I may know.  Anything
is better than to be left in entire
ignorance of what is going
on.  I am delighted that Bess
is finding even temporary 
contentment in her life at Bryn
Mawr.
Your loving father,
John A. Lomax
