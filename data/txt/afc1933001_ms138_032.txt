4
old, Yalmer's birthday is in
May and he's going to be 47
years. How old are you, Alan
please tell us. How's your cold
you had when you left, I
thought of that too many
times. I wish we were rich
and had a car we'd make 
a trip and come to see
you, you must of been some 
sort of a spiritual person, cause
you left me some kind of 
a wanting or thinking ideas
over you, you were so loveable
to me, I'll have to quit
before I say too much. 
Good night Honey.
[*answer soon
but different
Alan*]
Yours truly
Mrs Lillian Forster
