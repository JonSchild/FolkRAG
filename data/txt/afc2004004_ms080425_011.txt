AL:   And tell us about where you're from.

Man:   Eider, Alabama.

AL:   You have kind of a different style over there-- how
is it different?

Man:   Well, one thing that makes a difference is that they 
beat two beats over here, we beat four beats to the measure. 
It changes the sund of the singing a little bit.  It's good-- 
it's all good.

AL:   What's your profession, your work?

Man:   Well, actually, farming, but got inthe feed and 
seed business now a lot.  I got three sons that work with 
me.

AL:   Farming goes back in your family a long way? Where'd 
they come from to start?

Man:   England. . . don't know where, but they came from England.

AL:   What's your name?

Man:   Carnice Wooten.

AL:   Wooten, that's gotta be Scots, doesn't it?

Wooten:   Maybe it was Scots, no,. . . I couldn't tell you.

AL:   The Wootens are of the big singing families. . .  how 
many?

Wooten:   How many Wootens sing?   I couldn't tell you that 
at all.  I got no answer for that.

AL:   You could fill a whole church with Wooten singers, I 
guess.
