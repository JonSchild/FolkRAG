Robert.  They don't know who it was.  Son told 'em he was workin', 
                                   he was workin'.   So one white man told 
them that he came through 'bout the same time, [driven] ridin' through 
his field an' comin' by Gene's fiel'.  He seed them two out there 
workin'; that was Uncle Gene and Son.    An' he wouldn't take 
their word.   They just testifyin' on the dawg's side.
TL:          Who wouldn't take the word, the __________?
BJ:           No-o.   Jus' the crowd, hootin' around.  There wasn't no
                     .   Period.   But the boys didn' have no part in it 
nonesoever.   'Cause when the boys heard they had caught Son to kill 
'im, they ah -- when they got there, there was shootin'.   But 
the boys really went to stop 'em.   You know.  'Cause they didn', 
they jus' didn' believe it.   An' I can say for sure, the boys 
even buried 'im.   You know, [(dug a hole, got a box)] got Uncle an' buried 'im.  
Because they wrapped him up in [the] a buryin' [site (with] sack like meat, 
an' throwed 'im in a hole.   (That girl) actin' real crazy.  That 
girl actin' real crazy 'cause she said they stuck                out, 
an' they blocked that out; they wouldn't put that in the paper.  
Nowhere.   They said that she knew it was him.   It was not Son. 
Son [tol em']                    [, said;]  it wasn't him.    [Son]
Tol' them that when they did catch 'im, said, "I guess this'll 
stop that --"   Said, "I guess this'll run that, that black soandso 
away from here."    [Tol] You know, Uncle Gene, ya know.  I guess they wanted 
him to leave.   You see?   They just didn't like Uncle Gene.   An' 
ah, but anyway, ah, when they was, ah, befo' they kilt Son, they 
asked him 'bout what his last request was.   Now, one white boy 
tol' this, the boy said, tha's why we know it.   An' he tol' 'em 
to have his pitchur made an' send it to his sister -- tha's Mama.  
'Cause him an' Mama -- at that time, they didn' know where Uncle was.  I was tol'
 [tellin'] ya, Uncle lost for long.    But they was two whole ones, 
that they could -- you know, same mother an' same father.   But 
Uncle was, too.   In other words, the same father, however, Uncle 
an' the same mother.   But Auntie, Auntie Lena an' 
Son an' Mama were three wholes, whole sister an' brother, I 
mean.    An' so ah, but anyway, they thought they was doin' sumpin' 
hot, ya know, credit, ya know, they do that.   They went ov' town 
an' got a pitchur thing an' went and took his pitchur up on the tree; I 
got it home now.
