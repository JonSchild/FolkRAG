Ain' Goin' Down to de Well No Mo'

O--------------
Lawd, down in de bottom----------
Mud up to my knees, mud up to my knees,
Oh, that ol man so hard to please.

Oh, baby,
Oh, black gal,
Oh, black gal, black gal, black gal,
Ain gwine down, ain' gwine down, ain gwine down
To de well no mo'------
If I gets able,
If I gets able, able, to pay dis debt I owe, debt I owe,
Ain' gwine down, ain' gwine down to de well no mo'.

Something's funny, -----ee-----
I couldn' understand, I couldn' understand, couldn' understand,
Got me charged wid murder
