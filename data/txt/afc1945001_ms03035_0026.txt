-2- MICHIGAN

What is reported by the Commission as happening in the area
of the housing project is this:
An automobile containing two or three strangers casually stops
at a house where some person is working on his lawn or fixing a garden,
and after showing interest in the man's flowers or house, a stranger says:
"It's too bad they're going to move Negroes into the project."
The householder usually retorts, "Oh no, you've just been 
misinformed."
"Yes, I have it on the best authority that the Government has
decided to move colored people into the project, and it's a pity for it'll
certainly ruin this nice neighborhood," the stranger or his friends persist.
In some cases, strange cars stop and a householder is approached
to find out if his house is on the market. It is admired and if he shakes
his head over the low price offered, he is told: "Of course, the fact that
the Government is going to move Negroes into the Brightmoor project just
depreciates your property that much."
Telephone calls to the Mayor and Commission the past week
followed the same tenor:
"Is it true that Negroes are going to be permitted to live in the [*5*]
Brightmoor project?" Repeated 60 times in the past week.
"I own a house near the Brightmoor project and I hear that the [*5*]
Government is going to set aside 25 per cent of the houses there for
colored people."
"I hear they're turning over 10 per cent of the Brightmoor [*5*]
houses to Negroes."
