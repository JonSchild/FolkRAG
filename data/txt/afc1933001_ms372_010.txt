HOME ON THE RANGE ESTATE
Pohopoco Valley--Route Three
Lehighton,PA.
Nov.12,1945

Dear Mr. Lomax:
    Your recent letter is before me.
    Mr. Donald Day sent a copy of your long-winded story, for the Southwest
Review,of a song called Home on the Range, to me some few weeks ago.
    Is this the first of a series of articles to be written, by you, on
all the American folk tunes known to you?  Or did the song Home on the
Range hold some unusual interest and appeal for you?
    The enclosed is an open letter I sent to the Southwest Review in answer
to your Home on the Range article.  Since the Southwest Review may have a
reason for not publishing my letter, I now send you a copy for your files.
    It's a very poor copy, for which I apologize,--but I'm a "song tinkerer"
and very busy at present distorting a tune very familiar to you.
    Did you see the Dallas News article on Home on the Range?  I think you
might be interested in some of the many letters I have received, since
then.
    Best wishes,
    David W Guion
