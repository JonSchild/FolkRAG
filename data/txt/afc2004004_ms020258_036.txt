BJ TAPE 10,  p. 6

BJ:   There's a lot of verses to it.  An', an', an' it's pitiful, 
too, "Diamond Joe." You know, 'cause. . .

AL:   What is it about, anyway?  Who is Diamond Joe?

BJ:   It's a person in trouble. You know, an' he calls for somebody
to come an' git 'im.   Jist like you go off from home?   You know, you
can't git nothin' an' can't git back.  They say that's what the song -- They
[all] off, ya know, 'way off, an' so they say, "You better come an' git
me."

AL:   Well, who was Diamond Joe?

BJ:   I don't know.  I guess Diamond Joe was just the one who got 
some money.   See, like I'd send back to you to tell ya to come
an' git me.  Or send back to my parents, you know.   Hit mean
money.   'Cause Diamond Joe jus' natuchully mean money, ya know.
But for somebody to [say] sell a diamon', ya know, is money, that what 
they meant then, But the Joe, I reckon, that was just somebody 
sayin' to come an' git me. Any-anyone that got money come an'
git me.   'Cause Diamond Joe, [he ain't] I need to come home!   Hah!
      An' we used to have a lot of fun singin' that.   Because a
bein' such a hard luck, I ain't got enough money.   Said, "Diamond 
Joe better come an' git me now!"  Ha, ha!  Yeah, "Diamond Joe" 
was a pretty lil' thing. We used to, jus' used to prance it, ya
know. They'd git out an' prance "Diamond Joe". . . 

AL:   What kind of prance?

BJ:   Just prance around, ya know, like us did at night.  You
know, just prancin'.

AL:   Did you ever hear "Coonie and Delia"?
            Coonie told Delia, da-da-da-dee-dee-dee, etc.
            Delia's gone one more round,
            Delia's gone.
You musta heard that one.
