day I went to see her remind me of the tirades I used to address to
Alan, after one of the particularly stupid days. Then too, she's a
worker's child and so much easier to talk too than the stupid little
middle class brats. Oh, she's a find. And the possibilities of having
a strong chapter of about fifty that can go up and spit in Mr. McCallums
eye and dmand recognition next fall [go] grow brighter daily. Wouldn't 
it be swell? I just glow every time I think about it. And if the high
schools are strong enough, the Universities can take care of themselves
you know. Oh, I get so sick of the asu and the ycl here. I go in spite
of them, not because of them, and also because I kind of enjoy ramming
my head against a wall. Nobody else would be fool enough to think
they could knock it down, but I'm such a goddam idealist.

Tonight is glorious, with honeysuckle and very cool; my energy evaporates
and my muscles melt away like the cotton candy we use to buy at the
fair. Every night I am so. I sleep like the dead, and walk miles and
miles every day, and am always very excited over something. This is
a good life; I have a penny and a street car token to last me five
more days. You see, I am growing commendably frugal, I have had that
penny and that street car token for three whole
days now.

Please write me a letter. I will send this to you if Elizabeth has a
stamp. Give my love to Miss Barnicle. I love you both very much, though
God knows why. Have you drowned?
Bess
