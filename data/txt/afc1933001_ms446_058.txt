     O, sinners will you not go?
     There is room enough for you I know,
     Our boat is sound, the passage free,
     And there is a better land for thee!

     Farewell, dear friends, I cannot stay,
     The home I seek is far away;
     Where Christ is not, I cannot be,
     This land is not the land for me.

     Praise be to God, our hope on high,
     The angels sing, and so will I;
     Where Seraphs bow and bend the knee,
     Oh, that's the land, the land for me.

No. 37

Farwell, my dear brethren, the time is at hand,
That we must be parted from this social band;
Our several engagements now call us away,
Our parting is needful, and we must obey.

Farewell, my dear brethren, farewell for awhile,
We'll soon meet again if kind Providence smile;
But while we are parted, and scattered abroad,
We'll pray for each other and trust in the Lord.

Farewell, faithful soldiers, you'll soon be discharged,
The war will be ended, the bounty enlarged;
With shouting and singing, tho' Jordan may roar,
You'll enter fair Canaan, and rest on the shore.

Farewell, younger brethren, just 'listed for war,
Sore trials await you, but Jesus is near.
Although you must travel this dark wilderness,
Your Captain's before you: He'll lead you to peace.

The world, and the devil, and sin, all unite,
And bold persecution, your souls to affright;
