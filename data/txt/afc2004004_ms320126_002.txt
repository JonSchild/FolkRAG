EDWIN

I hope he don't do like that big movie concern out of
Chicago [that] took a movie and interviewed us for an hour
and ten minutes. We played for 'em. Out of Chicago, I
don't who they are or anything like that.

LUDERIN

The name is Noise Productions, Incorporated.

EDWIN

They come over there for an hour and ten minutes at
Darbonne's house.

LUDERIN

They were making a commercial.

A. LOMAX

I think it might be better if you all swapped places, would
that be o.k.?

(music: "Jambalaya")

A. LOMAX

Hold it, hold it. Who does the talking in the group when
you're on the air?

LUDERIN

Well, I do it, but I don't talk in French, I talk in
English. 

A. LOMAX

That's fine. Why don't you just introduce the group before
we start, whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready we'll
start.

LUDERIN

I don't know if he wants to be in on this or not.
