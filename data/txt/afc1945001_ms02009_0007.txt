designated rumor reporters are used, their names should be withheld.
Rumor reports should not be taken over the telephone, first, because the
use of the telephone exaggerates the seriousness of the rumor and, second,
because the telephone encourages spontaneous conversation about the rumor
instead of a considered inclusion in the analysis.

Reports should as nearly as possible describe the circumstances
in which the rumor was repeated and the type person telling it. The actual
name of the person is not important as there should be no effort to track
down the originator of the rumor or to assign responsibility for its spread.

RUMOR ANALYSIS

As information clues, rumors must be divided with regard to
their content. The first natural division is into local and non-loca
types. The classification of local rumors will depend on the rumors which
circulate in your community. Non-local rumors, for most efficient handling
by the Office of War information, should be divided as follows:

1. Production: raw materials, agriculture, finished products, general progress.
2. Transportation
3. Manpower: labor, management.
4. Economic problems
5. Price control
6. Wage stabilization
7. Rationing, conservation, and salvage
8. War bonds, taxation, inflation
9. Military matters
10. Selective Services
11. Consumer problems
12. Health and welfare
13. Minorities
14. Civilian responsibilities
15. United States Government
16. United Nations
17. Neutral nations
18. The enemy
19. Domestic information programs
