Tape: 242 cont.

goin' to heaven, and when you're singin' those songs, what are you
thinkin' about? I notice that people cry a lot.
You notice--. One thing ... you think about the words of that song
and the melody of that song, that's, uh, you think of what them words
mean when it was you that they were singin' about how you felt at
that time.
Most people when they're singin' the songs, who are they thinking
about, do you think?
Well, maybe they're picturin' theirself in the man's place that
wrote the song, or how the words, what the words said, and how he felt
and what he was thinkin' about, and maybe if he had experienced what
he was writin' about.
So many of the songs are about death...
Well, the main, none of the main songs...
the biggest part of it is Bible verses, that's from the Bible now. It
mentions death and love in the songs. The Bible mentions death in
practically every chapter, no tellin' how many times, and, uh
...                        and all of that too. And you sing
about heaven, you sing about violence, you sing about Jesus died on
the cross, and all of that, and, uh, who was risen from the dead, and
you sing all in the songs, and that's all from the Bible. You have to
feel somethin', you know, if you sing it from the heart, you feel it
in your heart.
Do you think that Sacred Harp singin' sounds as good as, say, when
black folk sing their spirituals in church? Do you think it's as good,
or better, or what? How does it sound? Black folk sound is such a 
mellow sound.
