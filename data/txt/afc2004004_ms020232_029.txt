BJ:      I don' know why they won't [go] either.  He said he can't git them
out.   Said they done talked an' talked.   Cain't git 'em. . .
AL:     Are they scared?
BJ:      They mus' be scared, I [don' know] reckon.  I don' know why, but they
jus' . . .They's two families, he said, still there.   An' they jus'
in the same way.   They can't git 'em to leave.   Don't know
why.
           An' [then, ? ?]  (the other'n's?) scared to go back in
there to try to git 'em out, you know, you see?   An' they, some of
their (friends will?) try to git 'em out. Meet 'em in town.

Says he treat them [folk] po' colored people so bad.   The lil' white

AL:      You know, Bessie, they had an old custom in Europe in the
old days.   And this has nothing to do with Negroes and whites,
just among the whites in Europe.   Where, they called it the
"right of the lord," of the noble or of the king or whatever
the local man was.   He had the right to have all the young girls
of the time.   That is, any girl that was raised on his place, on
his estate.   He had her first.   That was just absolutely accepted
by everybody.
BJ:      That's just like a church.  [I forget what] That, that church what they
do that in.
AL:      What?
BJ:       Just like that church what they do that in now, you know.
