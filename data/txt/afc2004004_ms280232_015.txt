3) And when our standard was set up, so fierce the wind did blow, Willy 
The golden knob came frae the top and to the ground did fall,Willy. 
The second sight that Sandy said, 
That nane will gang ava, Willy, 
While pipers, etc. . 

4) When brawly they attacked our left 
Our front and flank and all, Willy, 
Our bold commander on the field 
"Face the left"did call, Willy. 
And there the greatest slaughter made 
That ever poor Tonnell did see, Willie, 
While pipers, etc. . 

5) First when they saw our hieland lads 
They swore they'd slay us all, Willie. 
And yet the file did break for fear 
And sae did run away, Willie. 
We drave them back to bonnie brigs, 
To guns and flutes and all, Willy, 
While pipers, etc. . 

6) But when the general viewed our lines 
And they in order saw, Willie, 
He started marching to the town 
And back his lfet to draw, Willy. 
Then we took them a bitter gait 
To get a better foe, Willy, 
While pipers, etc. . 

7) And then we ralied on the hills 
And bravely up did draw, Willy, 
But gin ye spear who won the day, 
I'll tell you what I saw, Willy. 
We baith did fight and baith were beat, 
And baith did run awa', Willy, 
So there's my canty hieland song, 
About the thing I saw, Willy.

The next song, Aiken Drum, is also a song of the early Jacobite 
period - of King George 1st's days, around about 1715. . . 
1) Ken ye how a Whig can fight, 
Aiken Drum, Aiken Drum, 
Ken ye how a whig can fight, 
Aiken Drum. 
He can fight the hero bright 
With his heels and armour light, 
And his wind of heavenly right 
Aiken drum, aiken drum, 
Is not Jamie in the right 
Aiken Drum ?
