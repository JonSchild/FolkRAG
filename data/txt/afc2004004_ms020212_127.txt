Dear Mr. Kass:
I find it rather strange that I haven't heard from you
any further about your interest in having Hobart Smith
and other informants of mine at the Festival.  I think
at the time I wrote you, I said I would like to present
them, myself.  It may have been that you felt I was
asking for a large fee.  Such was not the case.  It
seems to me that enterprises like yours should be
helped as much as possible by those interested in folk
music.
Can you tell me whether Bessie Jones and/or her group
are definitely scheduled for the Festival?  I keep
hearing from her rather vaguely about this matter and
I am concerned about their getting back home.
Very truly yours,
Alan Lomax
