Tape:  Sacred Harp-- interviews    39

Mr. Madden:   He didn't sing in his sleep, he'd sing and
wake us up.

AL:   Do you suppose that the Madden family could sing us
a little special Sacred Harp song? . . . so we could hear how
the Maddens sound alone out of the crowd?  That'd be wonderful.

McG:   You don't need to book, just start one off.

They sing a bit.

AL:   This whole table looks like Amazing Grace to me.  Is
sure part of Amazing Grace, isn't it?   Who made all this
good food here?

(Bad audio)

Madden:   I wish I could eat.  They pumped me up with x-rays
and ever since I can't eat much.
