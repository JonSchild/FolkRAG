Mr. R.P. Wetherald;
R.C.A. Victor
Camden, N.J.

Dear Mr. Wetherald:

The most charming singer of old world ballads
that I know of-- not in any particular authentic American
style, but in a characteristic Irish style of his
own which is extremely captivating is Burl Ives. I
think his albums of songs will far outshine those of
Niles and the other Dulcimer players on Columbia, whose
names I can't recall, at the moment. I suggest that you
see him on your next visit to New York. His address is
550 Riverside Drive, Tel. No. Monument 2-8244.

I'll get you the copy of the Ledbelly JailHouse
Songs as soon as possible. I've not hurried because I
felt one might let the scent of the chain gang album
depart from the public nostril.

Very best regards,
Alan
