Dallas, you see, and continue listening to the Ec there, if I think I can get on in the German by myself. In all of which Shirley concurs. Let me know right away, because I must register for the correspondence course soon. I hope this sounds sensible to you; the more I look at the old Orals the worrieder I get and the loather I am to leave Mrs. Dingus for a week or so yet, at least.
I had a surprise visit this week from Joan Gross, Kristi Putnam and Jerdi McCampbell, all friends of mine from Bryn Mawr, who are travelling out to San Francisco together by car. They stayed two days, and just as they pulled in (they had wired ahead so we were more or less prepared) in also came Marigold and Aubrey, herhusband who were on their way further to visit Goldy's sister-- where I can't remember. They had written but the letter had been delayed and we were just bedded down. Everybody rose with remarkable poise-- I don't think Jerdi or Kristi or Joan had ever been in a four room house with ten people before-- and we just had a lovely time. We all went out to Buffalo one afternoon and drifted around the lake or rode the surfboard, and we had a barbecue in the back yard. Nicest of all, Shirley had already planned a luncheon for me at the Mexican Inn on th e day that the travellers appeared, so they all came too and we had the time and ate the best food and got so beautifully air cooled. Everybody left with regret, I think, and I enjoyed myself as much as I have in a long time. You know how nice a hostess Shirley can be, and she was really strutting her stuff. Willie worked
