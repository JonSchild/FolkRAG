consider any one of these rumors without considering them all
is what the Axis would like to see done. It would be wiser to
collect a number of these similar rumors and present them all
together with the sort of counteraction that would point out
that nobody is evading the draft, and perhaps more important,
that we cannot, with any validity, talk about these parts of
the community as they were really separate sections.

While for the general educational programs and special
campaigns which may be devised by the Educational Director and
his advisory council, all media of communication should be used,
for the direct counteraction sections the radio should be avoided.
Any device which makes it possible for people to lose the false-true
continuity should not be used. Random listening, casual exploring
 on the dial until one hears something interesting, makes
radio inappropriate in this type of work. Similarly, street
corner speeches would be inappropriate in this type of work.

Similarly, street corner speeches would be inappropriate, though
they might be useful for other campaigns.

The direct counteraction program should be used to
eliminate some few specific rumors but, more important, it helps
to develop sound thinking habits in the community. Some rumors
are natural and unavoidable. They may be analyzed publicly to
help people understand that rumors are natural. Perhaps the
community could be shown why rumors develop. This would help
people to realize that rumors are based on emotions rather than
on facts.
