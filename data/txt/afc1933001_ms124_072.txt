Mr Alan Lomax,
Assistant in Charge,
Archives of American Folk-Song,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C..

Dear Mr Lomax,

Your note to my sister, the late Josephine McGill,
collector of"Folk Songs of the Kentucky Mountains," has been forwarded
to me here by my sister's publishers, Boosey,Hawkes and Belwin,
New York City.

I am tremendously interested in your recording trip to Eastern
Kentucky. I wish I might be of more service to you . But you and
your distinguished father know all the American field so well, I fear
I can be of small help.

However, my best suggestion would be to visit the chief educational
centersthe mountain schools where the best ballad singers are
known better than I at present know them.

Do you know Mrs Curtis Magee of Burksville who has been doing some
collecting in her section? The field has been less worked, I fancy,
than some other Kentucky regions.

You might write to Miss Fanny Brandeis , Upper River Road, Louisville,
who -as patron, what-you-will- was assisting the WPA people
last winter in assembling some Kentucky folk materials. If I were
home in Louisville, I could be ore good to you. But I have been away
since March, and next week I go on to New York. There I am to do
some work through September.

After that or a little later, I wish you and your father could
take me on in some capacity in Washington, Kentucky, or wheresoever.
The folk songs have a cumulative interest for me, the original impetus
coming from my sister's pioneer labors in the field. As Josephine
McGill's executor, I try to keep in touch with what is being done-
though it demands constant long steps- at a respectful distance- to
keep up with you and your father.

My mail will always be forwarded from my Louisville, Kentucky
address, Brown Hotel, and from here till I am more definite about my
New York address in the coming month.

If my acquaintance in Kentucky may suggest any particular"lead"
let me hear form you. Good hunting!
Sincerely,
[*Anna Blanche McGill*]
Anna Blanche McGill,Exec.of Josephine McGill
