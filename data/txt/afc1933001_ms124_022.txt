Miss Bess Owens,
Pikeville College,
Pikeville, Ky..

Dear Miss Owens,

During [the] September and October I shall be in the Eastern
part of Kentucky making records of [Kentucky] folk-songs for the
Archive of American Folk-Songs in the Library of Congress. [on] I am anxious to meet and copperate
with all the collectors in the region[s], doing whatever I can
to [forward] help them in their work at the same time as I ask their assistance
in forwarding the work of the Archive.

I [am particularly interested to discover that ??] was delighted
to discover in reading the last issue of the "Southern Folklore
Quarterly" is that there was at least one ardent collector in Pike
County.:[because] I have no contacts in that area and [because] it seem[ed]s
likely to be one of the most interesting from the point of view of [bal]
ballads in the whole of Eastern Kentucky. Will you be in Pike County
during September and October?[Would you be interested in helping
me find the best singers in the region] Would you have time to talk
over [the region with me] with me the problems of collecting in the region and
perhaps[help] help me to find [some good singers] some of the best
singers [o] in the county?

The Archive will appreciate whatever/[help] assistance[,] and specific information about folk-songs in Pike County you feel able to
offer; and I [should] hope [the] to hear from you before [I leave here]
September the first, when I plan to leave [for] Washington for Kentucky.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Achive of American
Folk-Song
