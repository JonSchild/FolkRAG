#3972 Henry Truvillion #31
3973 & gang at Washington #32
We had never been able to [make] record
track living, tie tamping, steel laying
songs while the men were actually
doing the work. Our staged records
were never entirely satisfactory. At Wiergate
Henry Truvilliion and his
track gang were a possible
source, f[a]or at Wiergate track-
laying goes on the year round.
Railways must be built to drag
the big logs out of the [forests] woods
[many] miles from the mills.

Again there were
difficulties, for this was my third visit. We could not get
the machine out into the woods
where the men were working
even if the manager had been
willing. And he would not give his
consent.
