1. You can believe it or not, but 
the story is going around that 
a detail of eight enlisted men 
was assigned to move to post 
library at Camp Davis, North 
Carolina. the men carried 
out the assignment, but left 
one book. Its title was: "You 
Can't Take It With You" 

2. Air Raid Warden: "For incendiary
bombs you should have two buckets 
of sand & a long-handled shovel." 
Housewife: "But what if it happens 
to be a high-explosive bomb?"
Warden: "You won't need the 
sand then."
