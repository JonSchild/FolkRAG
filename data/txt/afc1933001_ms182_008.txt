Postmaster
Jennings, La.

Dear Sir:

Some time ago I wrote to Cleveland Benoit and Darby
Hicks, Joe Washington Brown and Austin Coleman, in your
care. As yet I have not heard from these parties and
since this is a matter of government business I feel
justified in calling on your help to locate these people
and to try to get there letters to them in case they have
moved out of Jennings, La. If there whereabouts are unknown
I should like to know that also. I would greatly
apprecitate hearing from you in this regard by return air
mail, since the delay in replying is holding up the whole
project. A self addressed air mail envelope is enclosed
for your convenience.

Thanking you in advance, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
