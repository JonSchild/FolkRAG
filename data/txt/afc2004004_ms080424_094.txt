(Stan) to push the hide up in it. So, I"ll give it to him. Here now,
AL: Keep on talking about the banjos, and show us the ground hog hide.
Stan: Now that here is what I use for the hide. This is a ground hog hide,
it's ten years old about, and when I play,...this'll probably make two hides.
AL: You mean two heads.
Stan: I mean two heads, I call 'em hides, you know. Some of 'em call 'em heads,
and I call 'em hides. But it's heads in the banjo, but it'll make two heads.
And you have to tan these. (technical) You can see now, this hide here's
a little dark. You look in it, it's just a little dark. And he's fat. You 
know, if they get too fat, you can't use 'em. So that's what I put in my banjos,
I do my own work.
AL: That's a ground hog hide, you catch those things.
Stan: Yeah, I shoot 'em. This one's shot, you see the bullet holes where it
went thru. When you shoot one like this, you don't get as many heads out of it
as it does the others. So I've got quite a few. I try to get enough thru the
summer to do me thru the winter. And was one year here that I didn't have
enough to do it (unint.) Then I also make (unint.)
AL: What about the tops of the banjos, can you show us that?
Stan: This is a top, which you looked at a little while ago. This is a
neck, this is just for demonstrating...And this is a top, you put this
one on ffirst when you're buildin' one. And then this hook, it goes in
here...it's not the real one that goes in it, but you can see. And now
then you can see your wire fits right in this, and then (the hook...you
push your hide thru). And then when you put it in the bottom piece that
you're looking at, that's what holds it in. So it takes a while, it
takes me about a week to build one. I don't get in no hurry, because
I build 'em for people to play, and I build 'em to suit myself. Now, if
