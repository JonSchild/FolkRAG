Fisk, 14.  8.  WILL STARK.

That's about all I can remember.
(Rest of dubbing is too scratchy to be understood)

STAGOLEA.
Old Stagolea, what do you think of that?
Stagolea killed his best friend
About a five-dollar Stetson hat.
Say, boy, what do you think of that?

Stagolea killed his best friend
About a five-dollar Stetson hat.
Oh, bad man, Stagolea.

Stagolea had a forest (fire?)
She wasn't might sad.
Chopped him in to; 
Better give Lyon
And break the ballroom glass.
Bad man with his gun.

[The] Bill Lyon said, "Stagolea
Is gonna take my life.
I got two little children
And a lovin, innocent wife. "
Oh that bad Stagolea.

"Care nothin about your children,
Care nothin about your wife.
You done stole my Stetson hat
And I'm gonna take your life."
Oh that bad Stagolea.

One is a girl,
And one isa boy;
These two children
[Wasall life and joy] Was all hislife and joy.
Oh that bad Stagolea.

Stagolea  asked his woman
[â€œ]Say, "what have yu got?"
She run out in her
Stockin- leg
And pulled out a thousand spot.
Oh, that bad Stagolea.

Stagolea was on the gallows;
He got mad and cussed.
The judge said, "Maybe we can han[d]g him
Befo he kills some of us."
That bad Stagolea.

That's all I cam remember.
