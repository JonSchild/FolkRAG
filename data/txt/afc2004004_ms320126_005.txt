days they married and tied it for good. But once in a 
while, one would leave, and when they'd leave, well Joe
Falcon and them, they start makin' these records about love
songs and I guess they just continued, continued on love
songs. Everything in [if] French is...Of course, I try to
translate you a French number into English and it don't
sound too good, you know, but it sounds real good in French.
BUt when you go to translate it in English it don't sound
too good. To make it rhyme, you see. And that's why you
see its a hard job.

Was it because women were scarce here?

EDWIN

No, women weren't scarce, women weren't scarce. Like I told 
you...the farm hands, and a lot of them, when they got
married, they figured that was it. Most of their parents
would pick the husband for the girl, and they married for
life. Very seldom did you see that in olden days. See, I'm
seventy three years old, so I can tell you. Just like
myself, when I married my wife. I stayed with my wife and
we raised eleven children, and that's the custom in the
South. The people stay with their wives.

LUDERIN

One reason that you notice that when I come in, on most of
our numbers, that's the reason, I guess that we got a little
popular, we sort of varied from the traditional tunes. We
would add a little something extra. That may be the reason
that we were liked as we were.

EDWIN

A lot of rhythm.

LUDERIN

In other words, it puts rhythm in the number.

A. LOMAX

Let's go with that song just way you did it
again...(music)...start one more time.

EDWIN

A little snappier.
