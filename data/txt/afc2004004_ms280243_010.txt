The Magpie's nest: Isla Cameron. Music
1) For if I was a king sure I'd make you my Queen, 
I would roll you in my arms where the meadows they are green, 
I would roll you in my heart's content, I would sit you down to rest, 
Alongside me Irish colleen in the Magpie's Nest. 
Chors: 
Skiddle-i-idle-adle-o-dee-eedle-idle-um, 
Dee-eedle-idle-o-do-do-eedle-idle-dum, 
Skiddle-i-idle-adle-o-dee-eedle-idle-um, 
And I'd lay you down to rest in the Magpie's Nest. 

2) O the Magpie's nest it is a cotage neat and clean, 
It stands longside the Shannon where the meadows they are green. 
And I never met a colleen with such beauties blessed, 
Like me little Irish fairy in the Magpie's Nest. 

3) I have wandered all through Skerry I have wandered all through Clare, 
From Galway down to Dublin and from there to God knows where, 
But I never met a colleen with such beauties blest, 
Like me little Irish fairy in the Magpie's nest.

The Earl of Murray: Isla Cameron. 
1) Ye Hielands and ye lowlands , o where has ye been ? 
They hae slain the Earl o' Murray and ha' laid him on the green. 
They hae slain the Earl o' Moray and laid him on the green. 

2) O woe be to the Huntley, and wherefore did ye say, 
I bade ye bring him wi' ye, but forbade ye him to slay.(2) 

3) He was a braw gallant and he rade at the ring, 
And the bonny Earl O'Murray, he might hae been a King.(2) 

4) He was abraw gallant and he played at the ball, 
And the bonny Earl o' Murray was the flower amang them all.(2) 

5) O lang may his lady look frae the castle doon, 
Ere she see the Earl o' Murray come sounding through the town.

Goin' to Mass Last Sunday: Margaret Barry. Music 
1) As I going to mass last Sunday 
When me true lover passed me by. 
And I knew her mind was altered by the rolling of her eye. 
Fare-thee-well, my love, fare-thee-well, Agrah, 
Fare-thee-well Ballyhelly's banks, 
And I going to mass last Sunday, when me true lover passed me by.
