Report on Rumors - 10

Miscellaneous
1.  The Japanese may start a war on the Russians.  There are many 
Chinese in parts of China occupied by the Japs, who will no doubt 
be used to fight the Russians.  But when the Japanese lose two or three 
battles, the Chinese will turn against them.  (Intelligent and prosperous 
Chinese merchant about 60 years of age.  Phoenix, 8-10-42.)
2.  The casual defense worker who goes from one place to another 
will not pay his income tax.  He will gamble and throw his money away 
and will not have any when the time comes.  (Insurance representative.  
Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
3.  A brother of one of the saboteurs who was electrocuted is 
working in Clarkdale, Arizona.  (Employe of Government war agency.  
Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
4.  A soldier told me fifteen years ago that the American Jews were 
sending vast quantities of iron and junk to Japan, Germany and Italy and 
that he had learned that these countries had a pre-war understanding at 
that time.  He told this to Governmental authorities, but nothing was ever 
done about it.  (Retired merchant, middle-aged, intelligent.  Phoenix, 8-12-42.)
5.  People in coast cities are no longer wondering if they will be 
bombed, but when they will be bombed.  (Salesman.  Phoenix, 8-14-42.)
6.  The high price of modern electrical hearing aids is preventing 
millions of deafened people from assisting with War work.  They are selling 
at from $150 to $185 when they ought to sell for around $50, according to 
an electrician who has worked on them.  This graft is serious during war 
times; it seems that at least for the duration hearing aids should be within 
the readh of people.  The Government should crack down on manufacturers.
