                                                    The Old Chisholm Trail

about the camp fire and kept time by pounding the ground with the 

heels of their boots.

     The cook and his chuck wagon have driven ahead of the herd so as to have hot beans, 
sow-belly, sour dough biscuits and coffee ready for lunch.  One luckless cowboy punching 
up the drags behind the herd has unfortunately left his slicker  -  a water-proof overcoat - in the cook's wagon.  A sudden rainstorm blows up and the luckless cowboy is wet to the skin.  Yet he can sing as his companions shout in merriment and join in the chorus :


                              " It's cloudy in the west and a-lookin' like rain
                                And my damned old slicker's in the wagon again.
                                Coma-ti-yi-yippy,yippy yea, yippy yea,
                                Coma ti-yi-yippy-yippy-yea",

      Read the song with spirit and understanding and a tune will

come along.
