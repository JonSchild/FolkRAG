So Doggone soon

I'm so glad, baby, trouble don'  las'  always,
?     servin' out my days.

It's some got six months, some got two, three years,
got lifetime here.

Lawd, two, three years,
I wouldn' min' rollin' no two, three years,
But I'll tell the gov'ner, can't go no ten or twelve.

If you go nna go anyhow, leave a dime for beer.
On a drunk again,
