GRAND HOTEL DES TEMPLES
AGRIGENTO (SICILIA)

April 5
(Which it really ain't so, being as
we are now at Taormina)

Dear Shirley,
And such a town.  Yesterday,
after nine hours on a slow train
through interesting country, part green
with wheat or beans, part white,
or rocky, part pink with fruit
blossoms, part yellow with ripe
lemons, we finally arrived at
the station of Taormina, on a
level with the sea. From there
we had to wind around hairpin
turns until we arrived at the
town six hundred feet above the
station. But that wasn't all: the
hotel at which we arrived was full,
and not till we tried the sixth did we finally
get located, meanwhile winding around 
and around. But the view was worth
all the trouble, - a wide expanse of
sea and shoreline, up against the skyline
Mt. Etna herself, with slopes covered

with snow several hundred feet
down. Our train yesterday
skirted it on three sides for
nearly four hours. It is much
prettier than Vesuvius which we
saw from our window in Naples,
Vesuvius looks more dignified
or calm, as if her mischief was
premeditated, while Etna looks
impetuous and hot-headed. No
wonder Aeneas and his men were
frightened. It seems hard to believe
that Greeks as far back as
Homer knew this land; for 
Ulysses, you remember, had
some adventures here too.
Sicily is fascinating. We enjoyed
Palermo, though its finest antiques
are two chapels of mixed Saracen,
Arabic, Norman influence, with
vast portions of the ceilings and
walls covered with mosaics
of gold and colors. Agrigento has
beautiful Greek temples, some
of magnificent size, but the
best are those of Concord and
Juno, set on hills where they
can be seen for a hundred miles
around. Your father like these
