4. Mrs. Rosa Warren Wilson
Chronicle
a. She write to you inviting a
visit to record "A Day on the Plantation"
b. You agree to send me
c. Finding out that Martin's Point has 
no electric current, I notify her that
I will not come.
d. Without consulting me she arranges
to bring the Negroes in to Charleston,
rents a hall, advertises the show,
charges admission to a rented hall 
(about 20 or 30 were present).
e. We were graciously received, I
made some interesting records, my 
wife took movies of the best scenes,
etc.
f.  Seeing the small audience[s],
the two hired trucks, the large hall, 
and the two whites who did not look 
over-prosperous I suggested that 
Mr. Martin [he] send in to the Library
