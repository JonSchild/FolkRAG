Dear Mr. Berry:

In behalf of the Library of Congress and its
Archives of American Folk-Song allow me to thank you
for your valuable contribution to our collection.
The material that you were kind enough to record
for me will be preserved in the Library for the
pleasure and instruction of American citizens, and
will find extensive use for all sorts of educational 
purposes. Each item recorded by you will be cataloged
under your name and to your credit. 

If you ever recall further old songs and
stories, or if you encounter someone who knows such
material, we should appreciate your letting this
office know of it. Again, with much appreciation
of your kindness and helpful cooperation, I am

Sincerely yours,

AL s
