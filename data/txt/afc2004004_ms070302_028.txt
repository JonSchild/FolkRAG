It's a true story -- Northumberland 
Coast -- Victorian Times -- true 
story -- The boys sit straddle a 
bench of a pub and row 
Grace Darling

She pulled away the roaring sea
Over the waters blue,
Help, elp, she cd hear the cry
From the shipwrecked crew
Grace [t] 'ad an English 'eart
[S]The stormy sea she braved
She pulled away o'er the roaring sea
And the crew she saved
