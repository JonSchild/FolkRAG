EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
OFFICE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT          [*file Rumors.*]
OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Eugene Katz          Date: March 24, 1942
From: Andy Knutson
Subject:  Rumors Prevalent at the Present Time

         Reference to [our] the use of the following three rumors has
been noted in correspondence of the past week:

1. Regarding the slogan "Wake up, America": 
"Instead of waking up--let's go back to sleep, 
and wake us up after the war is over."
This rumor has been used with comments to the effect
that it is now too late to prepare for war, that the 
administration has already "missed the bus", that the 
generals are accusing the public of being apathetic 
because they are losing the war.

2. "England will fight to the last Colonial."
Axis propagandists have switched from the old slogans
to the effect that England will fight to the last 
Frenchman, the last American, etc.   And they are 
using this slogan to appeal to the Far East British 
Colonials.

3. "The British don't really want to fight, that's why 
Singapore fell."
This rumor has been designed to weaken our all-out 
war effort by creating a distrust in our British 
allies. The all-out struggle of Great Britain 
during the past two years is depreciated.
