[*Women more interested in preaching*]
V: They're more interested ind churchxand what go on
there 'an mens is. Mens don't pay the thing no tention.
Just mighty fewx that is interested in the preachin. I don't
believe none of um much care nothin bout that singin and 
shoutin and goin on. I don't believe they do. You don't 
ever see-- a man don't hardly ever shout-- we had an old man
down there named Jimmy Fuller, he used to shout at church
bout the only one and the last one, bout the only one I
know that did shout --mens--man.
A: Well, why do you think it is that women shout more than
men anyway?
[*Women shout more - easier to touch*]
V: They're more easy to touch. I just feel like they're more
easy to touch than man . More easy to feel anything than man.
That's the way I feel bout it. The mens is kinda hard hearted.
It's somethign strange when you see a man cryin. It's something
terribly dreadfully done happen when you see a man cryin .
It's something-- you better get on a wonder than cause he ain
gon cry for foolishness. Hh certainly ain't. When he cry , it
somepin dreadful done happen and he haven't seen any way it 
could a been helped. I don't like to see a man cry either.
I sho don't. Cause he just ain't gon cry unless it something
terribly.
A: Well, why is it, Vera, if the women
are the most easily touched it's the men who do all the leading
in the church. The men do th preaching and the praying? Why
do you think that is.
[*Women just weaker*]
V: My ideas about it, they're just weaker than a man, something
about it. That's all I know. They just weak. They not as strong (445)
