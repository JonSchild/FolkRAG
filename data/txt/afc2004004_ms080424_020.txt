nothin' up there but beech trees. And beech m(?) would grow on it
heavy, and the turkeys and stuff would come on in there. And they
set trap and were gonna kill wild hogs...And that's the reason, we
walked many a trip in there, and we'd get about 30[cents symbol] a day, I don't know 
how much you could carry out, but I did about 30[cents symbol]â€¦
Ray:  That's about on it...
ST:  And they built all kinds, they got roads in there, and we used to
walk in there, and camp in there, and now we can't...because they
all got it posted and all.  We used to ride our horses thru, but then
my nephew went up there, they said "you can't ride thru here no more."
And I teld them "ah, just take it and keep it" --see, that's where we got our livin', I tell ya, (unintellible)...cuttin' down those 
nice trees, that was bad...   
Ray:  And then the steam engine went on cuttin' the big timer out.
ST:   Finally cut it all out.
Ray: Got the job, you see (unintelligible)
St: Like I was telling 'bout walkin', I walked ten miles each day, 20
miles til I got close to part of that railroad...Got whitin's(?)
all the way up into the beech, had to cut that timber out.  And they
got $1 a day, I worked two years, $1 a day. But we lived off it,
It wasn't no fat livin', nothin' like that, and still now.  We could
have bought it for $20/acre.  They offered it to Dad for $20/acre, but we
couldn't get that money.  And now, one little house and lot, now you
get 40 and some thousand for that rock, and (unint.)  Lot of projects
up there now, but it's just about went busted.
AL:  And you told me that you couldn't even...
Ray:  I tried!  Sign up!  Not break a twig!...Not leave the black-top road.
