[have a ???] get the fish like that - on Barton Broad. Oh, I been 
on there scores o' times along with him. I used to go out 
everywhere [large empty space] I used to go along with him. He[?] used 
to play a fiddle up nights at Wheat Harvest. I used to go along 
with him, an' sit along the window board, back o' it - little old 
boy, I was. He used to play there every Saturday night. He used 
to get a shillin' for his time; they used to give him a shillin', 
an' if he could go to another one, you see. . .He'd go to another 
one, and kind of add a little more to it. Go round. . .(pause) 

Lomax: He'd get a shilling and all he could drink, I suppose? 

Cox: Oh yes, oh, he had a pint or two o' beer. They used to 
allow him a pint or two o' beer. You know, he used to go there to 
draw the custom. [at that tim] He - of course, there was music 
goin' on there, at that time o'd day the people 'd stop there in 
these pubs. 

Lomax: And he was a good fiddler, was he? 

Cox: Fairly good. He learnt hisself, he weren't too bad at all. 

Lomax: Remember the names of the tunes he played? 

Cox: Well, I - er - he used to play so many tunes, he never. . .I 
never did know him to have a name for any o' 'em. Knew some of 
'em - used to. . .(pause) er - the Yarmouth Hornpipe, or things like 
that. I never did know what - I never heard 'em [large empty space] a 
tune, not the name. 

Lomax: And you'd be sitting up there on the window board? 

Cox: I did. I sat there at the back o' 'em - little old 
customer. 

Lomax: Oh, until he'd get ready to go home? 

Cox: Oh yes, I'd stop. . .I used to be out of the way. I used to 
- get, I'd get my feet down between other people's back, an' set 
like I am now, so that I could set here. I - I wa'n't [not] 
annoyance to nobody. An' now they aren't allowed to go in. 

Lomax: You were just enjoying yourself? 

Cox: I was. Oh, I used to hear - I, er - I heard - you know, I 
[used to] heard all sorts of things 
I heard 'em singing the songs an' all such things like that right 
from little, though of course I [was] wa'n't old enough to pick 'em 
up. (pause) 

Lomax: You loved those old songs? 

Cox: I did. I - I like to hear 'em . I took delight in hearin' 'em.
