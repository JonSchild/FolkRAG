Dear Dr. Stouffer: 
We have received a letter from the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety, reporting a widespread rumor that a large number of Jewish men have, through dishonest methods, escaped the draft. 
If the Army sees fit to release them, we would like very much to be able to send this Committee whatever figures are available on the number of Jewish selectees and recruits in the United States Army. Would there be any objection to our doing this? If not, we would appreciate having the figures at your convenience so that they may be used in an endeavor to refute this rumor. 
Thanking you in advance, 
Sincerely yours, 
R. Keith Kane
Assistant Director
In Charge, Bureau of 
Intelligence
