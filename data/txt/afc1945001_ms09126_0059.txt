Rumors

1. Headlines that appeared in a local paper
in the small town of Tell-Me-More, Poland
on last Jan. 16, 1943 seemed to cheer the
people up quite a bit. So much so that one man
stripped himself of everything and had only an umbrella
walking down the main street shouting for you.

The Headline read, "Hitler Assassinated at
Mussolini Funeral."
