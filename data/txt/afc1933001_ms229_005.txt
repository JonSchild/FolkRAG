2.
This time I hope to see you explore some new territory. If I
get a free minute, I'll sit down and write you a chapter on
the Bahamas before August 1.

5. The enclosure from Lloyd Lewis was extremely interesting
and I'm sure you will want to keep it in your files. I'm herewith
returning it. Under separate cover, you will receive a 
summary of the History of the Archive, compiled and edited by
B. A. Botkin who forwards it with his very best regards. I think
I'm going to sue my slanderers.

Sincerely,
