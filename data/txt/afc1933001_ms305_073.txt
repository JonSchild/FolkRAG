American Folk Music
To Be Heard Tuesday.

        The richness of America's native
song literature is demonstrated by "Co-
lumbia's American School of the Air"
as it begins a Tuesday cycle entitled
"Folk Music of America." (2:30 to 3
p. m.). The opening program is de-
voted to a preview of songs to be given 
during the series. Alan Lomax, assist-
ant in charge f the Library of Con-
gress American folk-song archive, is to
discuss and sing cowboy, lumberjack,
fo'c's'le, whaling and mountain songs, 
sea chanteys, outlaw ballads, spirituals
and other songs. They are drawn from
a collection of more than 2,600 phono-
graph records made by the archivist
and his father, John A. Lomax, honor-
ary curator. Alan Lomax is to appear
in the opening half of each weekly ses-
sion. The second portion will contain
orchestral examples by Columbia Bradcast-
ing symphony under direction of Lyn
Murray and Bernard Hermann. Co-
lumbia is commissioning 20 leading
American composers to write short or-
chestral works based on American folk
melodies and prepared especially for 
these broadcasts.
