of a Livingston album.
That is one section now
covered with fair thoroughness, 
and this large 
number of 
unique tunes show the 
huge job remaining 
to be done.  The Livingston
songs are worth more 
than a single album.
No one has ever equalled 
Mrs. Tartts in covering 
such rich material
We'll be looking 
for a quiet place 
where we can rest soon -
