All the darkies held a meeting with a great delight
All the darkies went to court the next morning soon
To see what they did with that mysterious coon
The judge said, "One hundred dollars", and the darkies dropped dead
When I pulled out a roll of money as big as your head
I put on my kid gloves, and started for the door
Every darky in the court room began to roar
"I wonder what is that coon's game?" 40.

Even the ring plays and singing games of the youth are changing.

In the past the words to one ring play were :

Turn to the East
Turn to the West
Turn to the one you love the best.

But its present version is:

Shake it to the East
Shake it to the West
Give it to the young man you love the best.  41.

Another popular ring play is called "Satisfied". Any number of
adolescents may participate in it at one time: they join hands going
around in a circular fashion, singing and clapping their hands. The
words to "Satisfied" are urban in content.

See more little girl, satisfied
Would you be mine, satisfied
Have nothing to do, satisfied
But to wash and iron, satisfied

I got a man, satisfied
And a sweetheart too, satisfied
My man don't love me, satisfied
But my sweetheart do, satisfied

See and hear that train, satisfied
Coming around that bend, satisfied
Loaded down, satisfied
With the Memphis men, satisfied
See more little girl, satisfied
