              On October 8, 1942, at 2 p.m., at Joy Road and Grand River Avenue, a man
              described as an American, white, about 40 years of age and 5 ft. 11 in.
              in height and weighing about 160 pounds with brown hair, grey eyes and
              medium complexion dressed in a brown suit. He appeared to be a factory
              worker on his way to work. He told me that a friend of his who is a 
              soldier stationed in Texas and who was in Detroit on furlough at this
              time, told him that the Lockheed P-38 Interceptor plane that is used by
              the Armed Forces was a coffin with wings on it, stating that if anything
              went wrong with the plane the pilot could not successfully bail out on
              account of the tail-assembly, which would strike him or catch the
              parachute as he left the plane.
