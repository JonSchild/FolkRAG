Poaching.
I'm an ordinary painter and paper-hanger, and 
I've been at it ever since I was ten years old, ten years
old when I went apprenticed to this trade, and I've been at
it ever since, and I'm going on seventy five, and I'm still
going to work and I can paper a ceiling as good as any young
man.
Peter Kennedy: Tell me about your father.
Well, all what I knew about him really, he was a brass-melder.
He worked in Newcastle Blast furnaces. A brass-melder. That's
the only thing, like, that I really knew about him, see. But
his father was a poacher, and he followed his example and I
took it after him. He learnt me it, see? There was more
poaching done that time of day than there was anything, see.
That's how they got their beer money that time of day.
Peter: And what's the art of paoching?
Well, there ain't much art in it      the art is keeping away
from the keepers. Course, you can only do it, like, when the
moon is right, and when they're in season. But 'course, how
that used to be worked then, at that time of day, according
to what I heard old Dad say, they used to send a bloke out
near a wood, you see, and fire about a couple or three shots,
you see. Well, the keepers'd all flock there; the
remainder of the gang'd be in another place. That's how they
used to work it.
