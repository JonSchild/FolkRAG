Cross Road Blues , Robert Johnson,
Robert Johnson, Perfect 7-05-81(SA 2629)
I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees, (2)
Ast the Lord above -"Have mercy, now, save this po' boy if you
please."
East at the crossroads, tried to flag a ride,
Ee--------, I tried to flag a ride,
Didn' nobody seem to know me, babe, everybody passed me by.
Standin' at the crossroads, baby, risin' sun goin' down, (2)
I b'lieve to my soul now, po' boy was sinkin' down.
You can run, you can run, tell my frien' , Willie Brown,
That I got the cross roads blues this mornin', I b'lieve I'm
sinkin' down.
I went to the cross roads, mama, I looked East and West,
baby,
I didn' have no sweet woman, baby, in my distress.
