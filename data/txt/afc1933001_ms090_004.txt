The Ranch - 
Jan 5, 1942.

My dear friends, 
Well. I just by the skin of my 
teeth got back home (New Year's day) ahead of the 
worst of this winter weather - bringing 
my Negroes with me. We 
had got down to a situation where 
Oscor had to do all the stock feeding
himself, when I got in my 
more [?????] or less trusty Buick 
and set out to get help. I brought 
back a young fellow, about twenty-six,
with his wife and baby. He is 
a nephew of the man who has 
been intending to come and
bring us some negroes, and who 
will come out and perhaps bring 
some more in about three weeks.
We could have had all we needed 
had we gone after them in September, 
as we had intended.
This boy, Pete Nelson, is a grandson
