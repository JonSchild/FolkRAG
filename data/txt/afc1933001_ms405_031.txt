3.

Of the remaining three songs the first came from Mrs. Wynne Whitehill's scrapbook
of Silver City, New Mexico; the second from Joe Harris, Westwater, Utah;
the last, let us say, dropped out of the blue sky. For really it is a stray.
Perhaps the last three selections are each entire ditties. If not, I should
like to see what follows, and I should greatly value the complete songs
belonging to these other quoted scraps.

Down in the land of the centerfire saddle,
Down where the cayuse is peaky to straddle,
There's where the cowboy is bound to skeedaddle
Soon as the long trail's done.

Gimme a platter o' Lillian Russell,
Gimme a look at a skirt an' a bustle,
Then take my money and watch me hustle
Back to the sand and sun.


I'm a full-blooded cowboy,
I've worked upon the trail,
I've shot the shaggy buffalo,
I've heard the cayotes wail.


A little dobe cassa in the plains-land heat
A wife and brown-eyed baby, a guitar so sweet -
A chilli patch, a burro, and a goat or two,
This world's a good old place to live in, I think. Don't you?
