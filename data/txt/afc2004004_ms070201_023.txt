The Mayis -- St. [Ma?que]
He went into the kitchen and asked for
rum.  He [put a very l] filled his 1/2
pint bottle half full and marked the 
level of the liquor by making marks 
with his thumb-nail on the label of the
bottle.  This was done very precisely; 
the bottle was held up to the light and 
various people were consulted.  A
great deal of rather aimless fussing 
about.  Dancing, completely Haitian 
and the best I have seen him do.  
A great heavy man making very sharp
and precise steps and postures in spite 
of his [grosserie].  The face was a little
paler than usual I felt; the eyes were 
certainly fixed and slightly glazed, narrowed;
the expression somewhat sullen.  [This is 
partly afterthought.  I must verify these impressions 
when I see other cases of possession
