1.  A soldier was going around picking up every 
piece of paper around camp and throwing it away 
say "that's isn't [ye] it."  After several days of this, 
the officers decided he was mentally sick and he 
was ordered to report to the C.O.  There the C.O. 
gave him his discharge paper whereupon he exclaimed, 
"yep, this is it." 

2.  A soldier went to the C.O. and asked if he 
could go home for the week-end because his wife was 
[expectant] expecting.  He was given the permission to 
do so and the next week he again asked the C.O. 
if he could go home because his wife was expecting.  The C.O., 
not thinking, said yes.  The next week, the soldier 
returned and asked for a leave.  The C.O. wanted to know the reason, 
and the soldier said his wife was expecting.  The C.O. 
said, "Was your wife expecting two weeks ago," the soldier 
answered, "yes,"  "Well," said the C.O., "if she was expecting 
two weeks ago, what in the world is she expecting now."  
The soldier answered, "She's expecting me home for the 
week-end."  

3.  The best way to discipline a soldier -- give him 
a "waac" and send him to bed.
