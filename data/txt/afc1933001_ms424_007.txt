THESE THINGS SHALL BE

(Page 153 - Y.W.C.A. Song Book) 


These things shall be. A loftier race
Than e'er the world hath known shall rise, 
With flame of freedom in their souls
And light of knowledge in their eyes. 
Nation with nation, land with land,
Unarmed shall live as comrades free,
In every heart and brain shall throb
The pulse of one fraternity. 

New arts shall bloom, of loftier mould;
And mightier music thrill the skies;
And every life shall be a song,
When all the earth is paradise
There shall be no more sin nor shame
Tho' pain and passion may not die;
For man shall be at one with God
In bonds of firm necessity.

FOLLOW THE GLEAM

(Page 1 - Y.W.C.A. Song Book)


To knights in the days of old,
Keeping vigil on mountain height, 
Came a vision of Holy Grail,
And a voice through the waiting night. 
Follow, follow, follow the gleam,
Standards unfurled, over the world,
Follow, follow, follow, the gleam
Of the chalice that is the grail. 

And we who would serve the king,
And loyally him obey
In the consecrate silence know
That the challenge still holds today.
Follow, follow, follow the gleam,
Standards of worth, o'er all the earth,
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Of the Light that shall bring the Dawn.
