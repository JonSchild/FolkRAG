BJ:  I think I did.  About this man. . .ah, about the little boy
with the rope.  I think I did.  But anyway, ah, anyhow, this man
-- I musta told it up, up there in Connecticut somewhere; I know not
long ago I was, readin', explain it -- an' this man said that, ah,
these three mens was huntin' some, some sort of precious flower
that they was lookin' for.  Particilar flower; I forget the name
he called it.  But anyway, they had rambled an' had looked an' so they
couldn't find it.  So finally they come to a -- they see something
-- they was fixin' to go [away] an' 's on this great cliff.  You
know, high cliff.  You. . .when you get on a high cliff you can
look 'way down, an' the trees an' things is large -- You know,
it's a-'way down, deep.  They looked down this cliff an' they
seed this, this ah, beautiful-lookin' thing that they were lookin'
for, flower.  An' they now didn' know how to get it.  They'd had
to go 'way around.  You know, 's a long way.  An' then come in
to it or sumpin' like that.
     So they had these ah, ropes an' things all with them an' diffrunt
things, you know, for pullin' things with.  An' so, ah one,
ah, one man said, "Well," they had a little boy with them, one
man's son.  Well, he was with 'em to learn how to do these things,
father-to-father, to learn how to do these things, to get
this flower an' do things.  An' so, one man said, "When
we let him down, eh, on the, on the, on the ropes," say, "Tie
'em up around 'im an' let 'im down," said, "An' I, I'll ah. . .
An' then let 'im get the flowers out an' pull 'im up."
