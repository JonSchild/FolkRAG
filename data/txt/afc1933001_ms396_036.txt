5-I 

On his head rested a broad-brimmed "John B." white hat,so heavy that it would not blow
off as he dashed about on his pony. His saddle,bridle and martingale always were the 
finest that money could buy, silver-mounted,stamped with intricate designs and kept 
beautifully polished. He made a gay figure of a man, youthful,athletic,always ready 
with a story or a song, a knight of the Golden West in its golden cattle days.

There were girls in Bosque County. Some belonged to the church, and under
church rules they could not dance where the music was made by the fiddle. So,to avoid
trouble,at gatherings the young people sang songs set to fiddle music, Bob was the
favorite leader,singing to keep time and giving the square dance calls in between
the lines of the songs.

A commotion on the long gallery outside. "Here comes Bob," some one shouted.
Into the big front room where the expectant girls sit in chairs around the walls,
would stride Bob,hat off,spurs jingling merrily. A swing of the hat, a sweeping bow.
"Hello,everyvbody! Come on, girls and cowboys! Partners for Weevily wheat," and the
fun was on. As in the regular square dance,either four couples,or eight couples in pairs
when the crowd was large, danced the figures as Bob called them,and the crowd joined
him in singing:

Oh, Charley,he's a nice young man,
Charley he's a dandy;
Every time he goes to town
He brings them girls some candy.

Chorus:
Oh,I won't have none of your weevily wheat,
I won't have none of your barley,
It'll take some flour and half an hour
To bake a cake for Charley.

Charley here and Charley there
And Charley over the ocean,
Charley he'll come back some day
If he don't change his notion.

Charley loves good wine and ale,
And Charley loves good brandy,
And Charley loves a pretty girl
As sweet as sugar candy.
