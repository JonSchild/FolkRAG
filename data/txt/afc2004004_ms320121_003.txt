[*VHS 1317*] [song about jurés "Child born in the morning"--plus more talk
about jurés]

AL     Were jurés sung in a church, in a house, in a dance hall or where?

DF     For jurés?   No, young people had no clubs for dancing, people loaned
homes.  They loaned their homes to four boys.   They asked permission
to have a juré in the house.
There were no songs in churches; it was in houses that jurés
were, you understand, because there was no accordeon, we had
nothing, nothing more than voices....... [1/2 minute incomprehensible] 
Maman said, my daughter, you sing well, very well but you sing [loud]
too loud, but I said if I don't sing loud we can't have fun
[.....incomprehensible--important]   Maman said, How long can that
last and I said--until death [?]    And it was pretty!   It was
pretty!   They'd come with their Papa, if their Mamans couldn't
come or a grandmaman or an old aunt came there, but it was as if
the Maman was there.   Girls didn't go like that alone [....incompr..
imp[r].]   If the Maman, Papa or her replacement wasn't there a girl couldn;t
go alone to a juré.

AL     After the dance could the girl go home alone with the boy?

DF     Alone with a boy., no, no.  No, no, no.   [incromp.....impt....]
walked ahead of the Maman, don't touch hands, walk ahead of the
Maman, not behind, not either with theGrandmaman, walk in front,
not behind, and the boy was not allowed to touch the hand of the girl.
.......?
I met my husband after a juré like that--that's where we met
[......impt. unintell......] That was where people met because
there were not accordeon and no dances.   Jurés were polite; a boy
took a girl back to the bench and if she wanted a drink he got
her a [glass] [*mug*] of water.   If a girl's shawl fell in dancing, a boy 
was to pick it up, and she'd say thank you sir [*monsieur*]. You c[a]ould
 never be rude to anyone.

AL    Wakes lasted a long time, didn't they? Three days and nights,
or seven?   [She didn't understand--no answers]
