Dear Dave:

If it is not too late, this will introduce
Harold Schmidt, Fisk University, who has the opportunity
to make real progress in bringing a genuine
program of Negro music to the Negroes in the south,
through Fisk University. He is a work now on a festival
for the Seventy-fifth Anniversary for the founding
of Fisk and wants to have the Golden Gate and
Joshua for a evening's concert. It occurs to me that
it might be possible for CBS to send these fellows
down as its contribution to the festival. I think
the Gate would be honored to go.

With best regards, I am,

Sincerely,

Alan
