couple of times and then bluff him, but don't try to bluff him first. You
can't bluff a Mexican either, or a Greek. Japan has got the ships and the
planes and we built them — with our scrap–iron. And she's got the men to
run them, and you can't bluff 'em."

"There's no sense in talking about a second front until you've
got a million men to send in there. You might just as well dig a hole out
there and tell two or three hundred thousand men to jump in it. If you
sent a hundred thousand men over to France, Germany would knock 'em off in
no time and tell us to send them some more. Let's talk about a second front
when we've got a million or two men to talk with. We haven't got them yet."

"If Britain could have kept up those thousand–plane raids for a 
month she could've cleaned up Germany, but she didn't have the gas. It's
the gasoline that's holding her back. Same way in Australia. Australia
has to get all her gas from us and it takes three months for a round–trip
over there. Hell almighty, this thing will last forever."

"If Russia goes down this war will last forever. We'll never
see the end of it in our generation. They're hatching up something over
there now to save Russia, but I don't know what in the hell it will be if
she loses her oil and Germany gets it."

"Roosevelt didn't lose much time in giving it to the spies, did
he? Damn glad to see it, but don't you suppose Hitler might start killing off
our correspondents and other citizens over there if he gets his hands on them?
Wouldn't surprise me."
