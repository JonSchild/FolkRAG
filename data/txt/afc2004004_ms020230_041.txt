TL:    My mother used to tell me, when I was little, that when

BJ:    That's right.  That what I'm tell' ya now.  I don't believe

an' get, get that in 'em an' then they -- or wanna do these things. 
Some of 'em'll do these things.  Some folks have to get a drink
an' then they'll do what they wanna do, 'cause they ain't, they ain't
