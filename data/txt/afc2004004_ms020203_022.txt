got any sides in it, but he got a top across .. And the
white people just look at it, just stop him all along
the side of the road, looking at that thing, wanting to
know how it go 'long. He's just goin' on along, singing,
he singing all the time. Sho do. Makes up his own song.
What all he don't sing. As fur as I can remember, all I
sing that's real, old come from him... He'd come there and
go to sleep and sleep till late and then he'd wake up and
eat him sumthing to eat and then he'd be ready then for
talking to us and singing to us... It would be early. If
he'd get there early in the evening, he'd lay down and
stretch out on that bench and go to sleep. Well, he'd
sleep till mama come out the field and cook. And after
she'd cook supper, get it about ready, he'd wake up,
and she'd tell him come on we're fixin for supper. He'd
tell her the children bring sumpthin to him. So she'd
fix it out a plate and we'd bring it our there to him.
On the bench where he was and he'd eat and drink water and
light his pipe. Then he's ready then for sing and talk,
carrying a lot of foolishness stuff way over in the night
He'd keep us sittin up till leven o'clock--sumpinwe don't
never do lessen he come up there sit up that late. But he
just carried on so much fun, we jst sit up there and be laughin
at him. He just funny. He can dance. He lets his hair grow.
I bet his hair about that long. Sticking straight up on his
head. He got a big old round face and kinda large eyes. He
got pretty fair teeth yet. NiceNice white teeth.
