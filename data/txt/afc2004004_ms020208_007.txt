of the girl being there and her mama and all of em a member of my church,
and she begged me so till I just toughed it out and come on back with
um and he come on back and put all that stuff out in my church.  I
just sent him on away.  And, you know, that same rascal had the gall
to come back here and want to preach for me again!  I wouldn't even

R: Before?
A: No, what did you tell him when he came back?
