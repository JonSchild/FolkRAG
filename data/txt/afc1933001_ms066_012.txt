Mr. John A. Lomax,
Honorary Curator of the Archive 
of American Folk Song, 
Library of Congress, 
7456 San Benito Way, 
Dallas, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

It is a pleasure to thank you for your cordial letter and to 
learn that you can consider the acceptance of my invitation 
to appear on our Milwaukee program.  I regret that you will 
not be able to be with us at St. Louis.  In organizing the 
St. Louis convention I was delayed by an automobile accident 
that occurred in San Francisco this past summer followed by 
pneumonia this fall.  ordinarily I would have issued invitations 
earlier.

At Milwaukee out banquet is scheduled for Monday evening, 
July 1, 1940.  As you know it is extremely difficult to control 
the time element at banquets.  As definitely as I can 
state now, you would be able to begin between 8:45 and 9:00 
P. M. on this evening.  Since nothing is scheduled after your 
talk, you will then have as much time as you desire.  You may 
take an hour, an hour and half, or more, as you see fit.  At 
this date I am not able to state in what hotel the banquet 
will be held.  That is now under consideration and will be 
presently settled.

In connection with a machine needed for reproducing records, 
I shall appreciate if you will tell me the kind and type of 
machine that you desire, its name and any other information 
that would help me in securing precisly what you need.  I shall 
then make every effort to obtain it.

So that I have the information for our program, at Milwaukee, 
may I ask, in the event that you can accept our Milwaukee invitation, 
just how you would like to have your title worded?  
Would the following be acceptable?

American Folk Songs
Lecture and Recital
