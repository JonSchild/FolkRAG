Dear Bessie,
Enclosed are contracts covering your visit to Asheville 
on the 28th and 29th of June, and your Newport
appearance.  Please be sure to be on hand in Asheville
the morning of the 27th so that we can rehearse a new
routine with Ed Young-- if I can get him-- Peter 
and Alberta.
The second letter is about your appearance at Newport.
The travelling expenses and living for the group will
be paid.  In addition, each of you will receive $50.00
per day for two days.  Please note that you must now
write Pat Hooker at Newport (the address is on the
second letter) to give her information about the day
of your arrival and departure, etc., so that she can
get accommodations for you.
I'll see you on the morning of the 27th in Asheville.
Please let me and Mr. Morris both know when your train
gets in there.
Much love to you and John and all the rest,
Alan Lomax
