REEL 36 (Macpherson) 
Strachan 
Well, he was just a robber, but he wasn't supposed to be 
bad to the poor. He didn't rob the poor. He may have 
robbed the rich - stole their cattle and all that bloomin' 
kin' o' caper. And they began to hang him in Banff, you 
see, and he was fighting and he had his back against the 
wall. An old wife she put a blanket on him and he fell 
and no one could win near him. And then you see I 
believed it when I was young. I am nae sure yet. I 
would need to ask about it yet. It was said that the 
Banff folk had to keep their time one hour fast about 
100 years after that. They put their clock back when 
the reprieve was coming over the Devron. 

1/2 of an hour. 

LOMAX: And they kept them like that? 

Well, they say they had to keep them. The power of the 
Government would not let them put them back. There was 
said to be a kind of ban on Banff. That was the story 
of this Macpherson. They hanged him ower quick, you see. 
He was going to get a reprieve. The gentry would have 
been all death for him. The poor people liked him. 
He was supposed to be good to them. And he was a fiddler 
as well as a fighter. 

LOMAX: He was? 

Apparently. 
LOMAX: How does that come in? 
What's the verse I sang to you? . . . 

"Some cam' here to see me hang 
And some to buy my fiddle 
But before that I will part wi' her 
I would break her though the middle 
Sae rantingly sae wantonly 
Sae dauntlessly gaed he 
For he played a tune 
An' he danced aroun' 
Below the gallows tree"
