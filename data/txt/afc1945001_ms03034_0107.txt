III.   Public Cooperation in Reporting Rumors 

        The agency must be widely publicized as the place to which 
        anyone may report harmful rumors. Care must be taken to 
        reach all levels of the population.

        1.   Special persons may be appointed throughout the community 
              and assigned the task of noting and reporting all rumors 
              which come to their attention. To facilitate their operation 
              a questionnaire may be sent them every two weeks. In 
              addition to serving as a listening network this group, if 
              properly selected, can be used as a public opinion panel.

        2.   Citizens should be encouraged to report by mail all rumors 
              coming to their attention. All letters should be courteously 
              acknowledged.

        3.   Every precaution should be taken to assure the confidence of 
              the public in the high intentions and sincerity of the agency. 
              Only where suspicions have been allayed and confidence established 
              will the public give full cooperation.

        4.   The agency should never undertake the police function of 
              reporting or reprimanding particular persons for disseminating 
              rumors.

IV.   Checking and Refuting Rumors

        Rumors should be refuted only by competent authorities. It is 
        most important, therefore, that the agency establish sound relations 
        with the highest authorities of responsible public
        agencies (the Army, Navy, OPA, FBI, etc.). In other instances 
        responsible community leaders may be employed to disinfect some 
        troublesome rumor.

        1.   Rumors should always be referred to other agencies for refutation. 
              No "rumor clinic" should answer a rumor on its own 
              authority.

        2.   Refutation must be logical and factual. A single poor or 
              inconclusive answer does great damage to the public's confidence 
              in the entire enterprise.

                        The standards of writing in a newspaper "rumor clinic" 
                        should be far higher than in ordinary journalism, because 
                        the readers are hyper-critical of illogicality in those 
                        who are pretending to be logical, and are suspicious of 
                        those who are attempting to contradict some current common 
                        beliefs or ingrained prejudices.

        3.   Don't overstate the case. Many rumors have a kernel of fact. 
              The public's confidence will be enhanced if a policy of complete 
              candor is followed.
