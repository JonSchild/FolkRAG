Mr. Charles A. Thomson
Department of State
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Thomson:

         Thank your for the return of manuscript.     I
was delighted that your commission felt able to use
it.     Would it be possible to send me fifty reprints
of the bibliography itself.  I should like to send
them to a large group of folksong specialists throughout
the United States.   Also, I would like to send them
to some friends who have been asking about them for some [unknown]
time. 
                                                                    Cordially yours, 

                                                                     Alan Lomax
                                                                     Assistant in Charge
                                                                     Archive of American Folk Song
                                                                     Library if Congress
