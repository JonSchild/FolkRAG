Dear Mr. Brandon,
Naturally I will be delighted to screen the TALL TALES film. 
Can you suggest where this can be done? I know very little about 
the whole matter of movies, and we have no 16 millimeter sound 
outfit in this building.

If you have not so far cleared yourself on your songs, 
Strawberry Roan, The Grey Goose, and John Henry, I suggest that 
you do so. The only publication of Grey Goose is in American 
Ballads and Folk Songs, copyrighted by john A. Lomax, 7456 San 
Benito Way, Dallas, Texas. The Strawberry Roan is a composed 
song and belongs to Curly W. Fletcher, published in Songs of the 
Sage, Los Angeles, Frontier Publishing Company, 1931. His copyright 
on that song appears to be quite secure. John Henry is in 
the public domain.

I would be glad to consider the writing of a Foreword for 
your film, and possible collaboration on other projects. By 
"Foreword", do you mean a spoken foreword or something to be 
used in this publicity"

Sincerely Yours,

Alan Lomax
