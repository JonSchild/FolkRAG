3-Tex.Jack and Sil.Jack


And he cracked his fi sts together
And he stacked his duds and cried,
"'Twas in that thar religion
That my mother lived and died;
And though I haven't always
Used the Lord exactly right,
Yet when I hear a chump abuse him
He's got to eat his words or fight."

Now, this Bob he weren't no coward
And he answered bold and free:
"Stack your duds and cut your capers,
For there ain't no flies on me."
And they fit for forty minutes
And the crowd would whoop and cheer
When Jack spit up, a tooth or two,
Or when Bobby lost an ear.

But at last Jack got him under
And he slugged him onct or twict,
And straighway Bod admitted
The divinity of Christ.
But Jack kept reasoning with him
Till the poor cuss gave a yell
And 'lowed he'd been mistaken
In his views concerning hell.

Then the fierce encounter ended
And they riz up from the ground,
And some one brought the bottle out
And kindly passed it round.
And we drank to Bob's religion
In a cheerful sort of way,
But the spread of infidelity
Was checked in camp that day.
