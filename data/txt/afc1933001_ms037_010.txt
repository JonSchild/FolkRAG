Mr. Strunk:
Mr. Charles Seegur and I spent 
Friday and Saturday in Richmond, Va.,
and filled nine records - 35 songs - 
for the Library collection.
Both the amplifier and Pre-amplifier
need repairing. Would 
it be possible to have this work 
done through the Library of Congress?
Very Truly yours, 
John A. Lomax

Washington.
