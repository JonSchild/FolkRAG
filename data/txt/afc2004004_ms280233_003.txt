Bramble Briar:
1) In Berlin town lived a rich merchant
Who had two sons and one daughter dear.
By day and night they were so deluded
They filled their sister's heart with fear.
2) One night, one night of restless slumber,
The brother rose up from his bed.
He heard a servant court his sister,
He heard they had a mind to wed.
3) He told his secret unto no other,
But to his brother he told it, too,
"I'll put an end to all their courting,
I'll send him silent to his doom."
4) They early rose the very next morning,
A-hunting through the woods they go.
And there they did this young man murder,
In the bramble briar his body they throw.
5) "Dear brothers, brothers, why do you whisper?
Pray what's become of that serving man?"
"We've lost him where we've been a-hunting,
We've lost him where he'll never be found?"
6) She went to bed a-crying and lamenting,
Lamenting for her own true love.
She slept; she dreamed she had him by her,
Covered all over in a gore of blood.
7) "Don't weep for me, my own dear jewel,
Don't weep for me, nor don't you pine.
'Twas your two brothers did treat me cruel,
In the bramble briar my body you'll find."
8) She early rose the very next morning,
A-hunting through the woods did go.
And there she found her own dear jewel,
In the briar bush where his body was thrown.
9) She pulled a handerchief from her pocket,
To wipe his eyes that he could not see.
And all to keep him from the sun
She plucked the green leaves off the tree.
10) Three days and nights she did stay by him,
She thought her heart would break with woe,
Now cruel hunger creeps upon me,
And along with you in the grave I'll go."
