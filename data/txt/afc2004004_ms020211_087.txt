New York 25, New York 

First of all our sincere apologies, Mr. Lomax  .  . 
.  .  .  .  for the delay in answering your letters and also
in advising you of the option on Bessie Jones.  But a very
unfortunate automobile accident has played hob with many
things.

Due to the fact that we began so very late in the school
year, we were unable to put together a complete enough
tour for the group.  We had some dates, but not enough
to make it worthwhile.

We are still very much interested in bringing Bessie Jones
out here and therefore are wondering if you would consider
giving us another option for a period of time between
February 1 and April 1, 1965, said option to be exercised
on or before November 1, 1964, under the same terms of
our previous agreement.

I am sure that you undoubtedly are familiar with the work
of Dave Ray and John Koerner.  In your opinion, do you
think that they would make a good companion billing on
the same program with Bessie Jones?

Once again, Mr. Lomax, our sincere apologies.  We would
not like you to think that our business is conducted in
a slip-shod manner.  But the Fates have a way of
intervening.

May we please hear from you as soon as it is convenient.

Sincerely,
[* B Goldstein *]
