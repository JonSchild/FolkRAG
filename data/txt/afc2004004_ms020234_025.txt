BJ:        I ha--  Well,  you ain't never courted , then;  I wouldn't
know what to tell ya  'cause I ain't either!  Hum, hum!
TL:        What 's it about?
BJ:        I wanta know.  You asked me an' I wanta know!   Ha, ha, ha!
A-ha, ha!  Ooh!  Well, the way I,  the way I would think it was,
the boy come to see a girl he likes.   An' ah, jus' takin' 'er
out an' ,  you know,  an', for years or months an' things, jus'
carryin' 'em diffrunt places,  jes' to be their comp'ny,  you know?
An'  churches;  diffrunt -- I've  seen -- churches, [diffrunt] an'
parties an' responsible [an'] for 'er,  you know?   Carryin" 'er  backwards 
an' forth, that way, ya see.   That's  way I, that's way I
feel about it.  That's what I seen 'em does.  They ask for the
girl's  comp'ny;  they take 'er out;  an'  they,  an'  they limited
to this girl's  comp'ny.  They 'sponsible for her.  What I mean by,
if she get pregnant or anything, he has to marry her,  ya see?
An' so that's what what is.   That's a 'sponsibility  that he got,
[ah, for] upon him.  Ah...
TL:        And you've never courted?
BJ:        An' ah, an' ah, an' so, I,  I jus' say,  I,  I never liked boys.
I [was] went with a man.  I tell you my child was born when I was 'tween
12  an' 13.   Ya see,  an'  I had no boys.  So I jus'  don't  --  An'  I
seen the girls...I walk along with  boys, of co'se, ya know, [to] from
Sunday schools, an' like playin' an' havin' fun with 'em, [like
that] laughin' an' talkin' with em.   But they ain' come to be a 'sponsiblity
for me;  I ain' never liked that.  I wouldn't like it.  'Cause
it'd  been a boy, an' I  just didn't like it.  You  know?   You see,
if hit woulda been a boy,  a real young somebody,  you know...
Thank God I didn't have to worry with that.  'Cause I ain't never
like any!  I never liked no boys,  ya know,  'cause first thing
