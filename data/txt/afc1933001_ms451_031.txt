BLACK HILLS*

I went to the Black Hills, no gold could I find
I thought of the free lunch I had left far behind
I thought of the girls and their winning smiles
I packed up my outfit and went back to Miles

A Tern River rancher was the first man I met
A job at his place was quite easy to get
I thought I was lucky to get it but now
I wish I had never set eyes on a cow.

I'm tired of riding on rawboned old hacks
With red pepper tempers and razor edge backs
I'm tired of riding on horses that rare
And throw you head first in the prickely pear.

From mornin' till night I keep riding roun'
It's hell to get up and it's hell to sit down
Oh trouble and worry, tribulation and pain
I wish I was back in the Black Hills again.
