12- A  Female     White

1. I was in a drug store the other day
and a group of men were talking. One man
in particular was telling where he worked.
He said he was working in a plant where
they were making bombs. He told these men
how much the bombs weighed and told of
the work he did. After I left the store I
got to thinking about what he said. He might
have thought he wasn't saying anything
wrong, but you can never tell who is
listening.

2. A slip of the lip may sink a ship.

3. Slap the axis with taxes.

4. Don't believe in rumors. They usually
turn out to be wrong.

5. England will fight to the last American.
