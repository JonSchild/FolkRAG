          So she says she was so close, herself, so many time.   So
she says she asked God what it was, what was hittin' (hinderin'?)
her.   Sumpin' got on her min'.  She give up everything.   She
even fasted after she, you know, over-fasted.   An' give up all
what, well, she knew she was doin' wrong, ya know.   An' um', an'
so, she didn't see anything was in the past way; she wan'd know
what it was.   An' she lay on her couch.   An' ah, an' ah, in
her kitchen.   You know, a lil' ol' couch.  An' she says she was
asleep; she lay down there an' went to sleep.  See, she dozed
off to sleep.  Say it look like she woke up.  So the man, [say] said
it look like he's about fo' feet tall, but he's a man, dressed
in white.   Say he stood to the door an' tol' her, said, "The
reason you can't get no religion -- I mean the reason that
you cain't be saved," say, "You, ah, tried to kill you son
before he was bo'n."
         That's the man [that was] what preachin', her son, that was
preachin' to 'er.  She said she jumped [out across] right up off the couch!
An' woke right wide  awake.   You know, jus' come back to her'se'f,
ya know, outta [the dream] this vision.
         Says she went to prayin' an' tol' the Lawd that he's livin';
she raised 'im; you know, an' everything.   An' he is His, His
child, you know?   A preacher, a good, a Christian child.  You
know?   He wa'n' dead, an' asked Him would He forgive 'er.   An'
she said, she jus' prayed for that, jus' prayed.
          An' so, so she went on, an' she told everybody about it that night, in
the church, she prayed for it, she told 'im.  Herse'f.  That's
what it had come now.   An' so the next, um, Tuesday night, in
church, she said that something come to her and spoke to her.
Said, "It's not your goodness -- That he, that he living. . .
Not your goodness."
