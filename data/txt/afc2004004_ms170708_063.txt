Cox: Do you want me to try that? If I can think o' that. I
can tell you that one now in a minute. I didn't know you'd
got all this musics here, I'd a been here afore. (pause)
Kennedy: All the musics?
Cox: Yeah. Full of musics. See if I can think o' this one.
So come all you young sportsmen who carry a gun,
I will have you go home by the light of the sun,
For young Jimmy was a-fowling, was a-fowling alone,
When he shot his own true love in the room of a swan.

So the first he went to her an' found it was she.
He was shaking an' trembeling, his eyes scare could see.
"So now you are dead, love, an' your sorrows are o'er,
Fare thee well, my dear Polly, I shall see you no more."

Then home went young Jimmy with his dog an' his gun,
Sayin' "Uncle, dear uncle, have you heard what I've done.
Cursed be this old gunsmith that made me this gun,
For I've shot my own true love in the room of a swan.

Then out come bold uncle with his locks hangin' grey,
Sayin, "Jimmy, dear Jimmy, don't you run away.
Don't you leave your own countery till the trial comes on,
For you ne'er shall be handged for the crime you have done."

So the trial came on an' pretty Polly a-pear
Sayin', "Uncle, dear uncle, let Jimmy go clear.
For my apron was wrapped round me when he took me for a swan,
An' his poor heart lay bleeding for Polly his own."

Kennedy: Very, very nice. There's another verse though, Harry,
isn't there?
Cox: Not that I ever knowed. Five. (pause)
Kennedy: I thought there was another verse.
Cox: No. I never know any more. That's all I know, five.
D. Kennedy: Wonderful. It's a most moving song.
Woman: It's a lovely song.
Kennedy: That was your mother used to sing that, or your
father?
