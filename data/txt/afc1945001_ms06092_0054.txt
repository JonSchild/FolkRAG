3. A preacher at a small Phoenix church said to another man, "I wouldn't 
put in a new water system for another six months. I've been through 
the East and the Middle West." The other replied, "I think I know 
what you mean, but if the war should take a turn for the worse, 
there will always be two things left, land and man and they both need 
water." (This conversation was overheard in Phoenix 8-7-42)
