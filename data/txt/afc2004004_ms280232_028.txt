Tapem25. Ewan McColl:
The Dark, Dreary Mine.
1) A stranger once entered an inn in the north,
Where colliers were playing their games,
To an old man he said, with a sneer on his face,
"The money they earn goes on drink - it's a shame.
I never believed it, but now I can see
It's true what they say in the town."
The old man then said, "You are wrong, you will find,"
And slowly he said, with a frown - "
"He works down below in the dark, dreary pit,
So that folks like us by the fireside can cheerfully sit.
He works down the mine far from heaven's glorious light,
And his face may be black, but his big heart is white."
Ewan: That was taken down by Joan (Littlewood) from an old
weaver called Mrs Sarah Bolton in Oldham.
Joan: It used to be sung a lot - all people of about 60 would
know it.
The Leadr's a Bleeder:
1) Have you heard of Sir Oswald, the blue-blooded knight,
With his toothbrush moustache and his dignified kite.
He's a friend of the Feuhrer's and Musso as well,
He swaps dirty stories with the young Mitford girl,
Oh, the leader's a bleeder, you can't deny that.
2) One day in September in the year '39,
The Feuhrer said, "Lads, it's time Europe was mine."
And Oswald was  bawling, the Feuhrer can't fail,
So they bunged him protesting into Brixton jail.
3) On pheasant and partridge Sir Oswald did dine,
And washed down each meal with some good Rhenish wine.
And when he grew tired of the prison's hard life,
He could turn out the lights and lie down with his wife.
4) But Oswald grew tired of his stay in the cell,
The Feuhrer, his pal, wasn't doing so well.
So he told all his Chinas to start a campaign
To get him back in circulation again.
5) But Oswald we know was a certified louse,
But he'd plenty of wire-pulling friends in the house.
So they saw Herbert Morrison, told a few lies,
And left Herbert dashing the tears from his eyes.
