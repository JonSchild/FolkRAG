As you know, Mr. George G. Korson, of the Public Information
Service of the American Red Cross, is interested in securing the
Library's co-operation with the Red Cross in Sponsoring wartime
recording expeditions in three locations overseas. The proposal
calls for two recording machines and three field workers to be
furnished by the Red Cross, while the Library is to furnish one 
machine and the equipment and materials described below.

The project had its origin in Mr. Korson's interest in folk
song (he is the author of Minstrels of the Mine Patch and forthcoming
Coal Dust on the Fiddle) and in the interest of the Public
Information Service in putting its overseas facilities at the disposal
of the Library for a project combining informational and 
folkloristic value. 

Since this is an exceptional opportunity to increase the
collections of the Library from war sources and in such fields as
soldiers' songs, the folk songs of other nations, and documentary
recordings, I recommend that these recordings be acquired in accordance
with the following budget:

300 12-inch records at $.80                    $240.00
300 12-inch duplicates at $2.00                600.00
20 sapphire cutting needles at $5.00       100.00
500 playback  needles at $1.00 per 100       5.00
Miscellaneous (shipping, etc.)                      50.00
                                                                      $995.00
20 % Lab. Fee                                                199.00
                                                                     $1194.00

Equipment to be furnished:
1 Model K Recorder
1 Turner Microphone
1 Floor Microphone Stand
1 A.C. Extension cord
1 pair of earphones
1 Microphone Extension
