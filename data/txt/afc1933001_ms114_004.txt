I do hope this doesn't 
inconvenience you terribly
and hasn't upset any of 
your plans. And I do
apologize for this lateness
in answering your last.
New York is very fast
moving, very gay, very
international. Almost
everywhere you hear French
and the King's English.
I keep seeing men who
look like or know Philip
and having butterflies.
But I'm glad to be here
wandering about and

fitting back into the winter 
self. I've seen a lot of [Tuch?] 
and [Grittenden?] who are 
wonderful now and I love
them, also  Cheney who's a
bit chaosed by life in
general and very much job
hunting. People are being 
awfully nice, coming to see 
me in bed when I'm there,
and partying me into 
condition to go right back again
when I'm not.
I'll be so very glad to see
you, chicken, do have a 
large hand for me to hold.
Don't get too thin.
Best love, [Co??se]
