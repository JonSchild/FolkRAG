1638 A (Cont.)
So in fact I was Alabama Bound. And when I got there, I wrote this tune called Alabama Bound.  It goes this way:
I'm Alabama bound, Alabama bound,
If you like me, sweet baby, you've gotta leave this town,
[*Space*] 
Well that rooster crowed, Well, the hen ran around,
"If you want my love, sweet babe, You've gotta run me down."
She said, - "Don't you leave me here, "Don't leave me here,
But, sweet papa, if you just must go, Leave a dime for beer."
[*space*] 
I said, - "Sweet mama, babe, Sweet mama, babe,
If you must stay, [wi] I'll be gone for days and days."
