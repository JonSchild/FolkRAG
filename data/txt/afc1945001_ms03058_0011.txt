The Japs are right at our back door, up there.  Why don't they do something
about it instead of investigate.  Milwaukee, August 8

With the military strategists we have in Washington, we'll be lucky if we
back into victory.  Milwaukee, August 7

THE ARMY AND DRAFT
If you know the right people, you can get a commission (in the army).
Milwaukee, August 4

I've been trying to get in to the army or navy finance department, but the
navy won't take me because I don't have a college degree, and the army says
I've got to start as a buck private.  Why I"m over 40, and would make a 
heck of a combat soldier.  I've had many years of experience in a bank.  I
don't see why they can't use me where I'm best fitted.  I guess I don't
know what strings to pull.  Milwaukee, August 4

One man stated, "It looks like married men are next (to be drafted)."
Another replied, "Yeah, but not until after the election."  Milwaukee,
August 5

The eighteen year olds will be drafted after the election.

It's foolish to seek deferment.  They'll get yuh if they want yuh, and there's
nothing yuh can do about it.  Milwaukee, August 7

BONDS
They're pushing this bond sales stuff too far.  People have their own plans 
for buying bonds and stamps now, and as they push more sales of them on
people, they're dipping into cash they should use for household purposes.
Milwaukee, August 7

The blackout in Milwaukee is silly.  It's just another way of trying to 
scare us into buying bonds.  Milwaukee, August 3

INEFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT
They sure have a lot of bomb shells and fins at A.O. Smith's.  I understand
they are having lots of trouble getting freight cars to ship them in.
Milwaukee, August 3

They talk about wanting war production, why look at all of them bombs out
there at A.O. Smith's.  If they need bombs as much as they say they do, they
wouldn't have a bunch of them setting out there in the yard.
Milwaukee, August 3
