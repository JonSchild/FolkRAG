AL:   Do you have any favorites?   Seems to me there was one
or two. . . .

Ivey:   Oh, I got a bunch of favorites.   I like 222, Ocean,
that's one of my favorite songs.

Al:   What does that one say, what is the idea of it?

Ivey:   It's just a class song, one we sing real piously.

AL:   You remember anything about it?

Ivey:   I can't even remember the words right now.

(Man and woman start singing it)

Man:   No, that's not it. That's not Ocean, what was I
thinking about.

AL:   What is your profession, what do you do?

Ivey:   Well drill, I'm self employed, I well drill.

AL:   That mean you have to go down in the ground?  How far?

Ivey:   Oh, I stay on top.  I use the machine.

AL:   That what you been all your life, a well digger?
