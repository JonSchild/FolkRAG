BJ TAPE 16, p. 57

         But this beans here, you put them in the hamper.  He, he,
this boy laid his hamper down; don't stand it up; ya lay it down
in front of ya, ya see?
TL:    Oh, you lay it down?
BJ:    No, everybody don't, but this boy did it.  An' not only him,
all them great bean pickers.  An' I learnt to do it; it's a great
help to ya.  Lay your hamper down in front of ya an' put, an' pick
ya beans an' just throw 'em in there like, like that, you know,
straight, until you get that bottom full.  And then, you sit it
up.  You know, set ya hamper up in front of ya there, an' then. . .
See, the bottom is full an' the beans is standin' straight up.
Ya see?
TL:    In the bottom?
BJ:    Yeah.  Standin' straight up.  Ya got the bottom all full all
the way around.  An' that beans is standin' straight up.  When a 
bean is laid flat, you can pack an' pack.  Ya see?  You liable ta
have 80 pounds in there.  But, see, that's the cheat on you there
that they got on you.  An' they ain' goin' bring it back.  But they
got so good until ya can hol' your hands that way -- I did it, too,
-- you can tell when ya got ya 60 pounds.  I ain't jokin'; ya can
git so good in it.  [But, anywa]
         But, anyway, then, after ya get that top there, everytime ya put
[throw] 'em [there] in, jus' pick 'em.  An' jus' hol' 'em level in ya
hand.  'Cause you done learnt how ta strike 'em, [you know,] throw 'em like that.
An' that, that whole side, all, all them sides get lined up again.
You ain't go to take time to do it; jus', just throw 'em in there
if ya know how, ya see?
TL:    So that you get all the beans standing on end in the hamper?
