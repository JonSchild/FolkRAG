     But Denver -- he had light hair like his mother', [an'] he was
tall an' he[a] had, you know, his skin didn't look as good as
Bertram, though -- but Denver was a workin' boy! An' he was the 
youngest. He'd stay in an' he'll work an' he'll work. Talk (?) ...
TL: What were you working at?
BJ: Oh, just different work that we wa' doin'. Like, like some
time we be plantin' peanuts, [ya know] or, or...
TL: Planting peanuts?
BJ: Yeah. Oh, planting corn. Or anything we, that we'd be doin'. 
                                                or anything. I worked like a

BJ: Yeah. Only he born in June, [an'] he born the 'leventh of 
June an' I was born in February. But it was all in 1902. So, Denver, 
he wa' younger than we are an' Leola, she quite, much younger.

     "I wanna kill some hawgs this mornin'."
     Mama said, "Go on an' kill 'em." Jus' like...     hum, I wonder
[what] he think I wan' one of them hawgs up yonder (??).
     That mean to say he wanted ya to he'p 'im, ya see? But tha's
the way he say it all the time, "I wanna kill some hawgs this
