 and Claridges', in the evening. 
If you are at all interested I would 
be glad to have a chat with you 
either during the day of the 14th 
or on the Friday and week-end 
following then.
In any event, let me 
say how much we enjoy your 
programmes.
For your information & 
as a matter of interest I have 
made 150 broadcasts up-to-date 
(next one Childrens Hour on 29 Dec.) 
and have had successful auditions 
in London & Manchester for TV
Every good wish.
Sincerely,
Fred Lawson
