I'm going to try and play "Jelly Roll Blues" for you,
one of the numbers that's supposed to have had more origi-
nality to it than any other hot tune or blues in America,
according to musicians, publishers, and so forth and so on --
members of the music world.  I didn't name the "Jelly Roll
Blues."  "Jelly Roll Blues," it was named by the people of 
the city of Chicago.
How I happened to get the name, myself, thrown on me
as an alias, was due to the fact in the show business with
one of my old partners, a black-face comedian and the first
eccentric dancer in the United States, Sammy Russell, who 
was later known as Barlow, a team mate of Sandy Burns --
one night, while working ad lib on the stage doing comedy, Sam
said to me, "You don't know you're talking to."  I told him, "I
don't care;" and we had a little argument.  I finally asked him
who was he? And he said to me he was Sweet Papa Cream Puff right
out of the bakery shop.  That seemed to produce a great big
laugh.  Well, I was standing there, mugging, as you call it, a
thought came to me that I better say something about the bakery shop.
I said to him, he didn't know who he was talking to.  He 
finally wanted to get acquainted, so her asked me who was I and
I stated to him I was Sweet Papa Jelly Roll with stove pipes 
in my hips and ll the women in town was dying to turn my
damper down.
Question:  What did you mean by saying you had stove
pipes in your hips?
