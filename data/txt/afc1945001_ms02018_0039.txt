Progress of War

1.  It the campaign in the Solomon Islands fails, it will probably
be less damaging to our morale than to that of our Allies.  Such a failure
would have a particularly bad effect on the people of India.  (Mining
engineer, wide contacts, financially well-established.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)

2.  The Russian soldier has more to fight for than the German.  The
German soldier would stop fighting now if he dared.  I look for Turkey
to enter the war at any time; she will fight with Russia, never with
Germany.  Turkey will never let the Russians lose the oil wells in the
Caucasus.  (Pioneer Arizonian, who was born in Turkey; about 75 years of 
age.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)

3.  When the American Army gets into the war in a big way, and all
our land, air and naval forces are working together in harmony, we will
begin to win.  (Prosperous grocery store-keeper.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)

4.  It is being talked about that the administration is afraid to 
start a second front until after the fall elections.  (Housewife.  
Phoenix, 8-14-42.)
