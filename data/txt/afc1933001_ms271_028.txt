A MESSAGE TO HITLER
By Dock U. Reese
January 1943

Tune: Old Hannah.
Can be set to blues tune.

You can go and call Hitler
You can go and call Hitler
Call him on the telephone
Tell him he better get ready
Tell him he better get ready
'Cause here we come

Tell him we got thousands of soldiers
Tell him we got thousands of soldiers
We got millions of bombs
That we got a darn navy
That we got a darn navy
Some shooting sons of guns

Tell him there ain't no more loud hollering
Tell him there ain't no more loud hollering
He better murmur low
Tell him ain't no use of expecting
Tell him ain't no use of expecting
Help from Tokyo

We have a train bound to the axis
We have a train bound to the axis
And she is loaded down
With a well trained army
With a well trained army
Yelling Berlin Bound!

Hitler if you never been worried
Hitler if you never been worried
Your worry is on its way
For we have just begun fighting
For we have just begun fighting
In the American way.

If you don't believe we are ready
If you don't believe we are ready
Ask your friend Tojo
And I bet he would tell you
And I bet he would tell you
That we are on the go.

Well my mama done called me
And I answered ma'am
Well my mama done called me
And I answered ma'am
She said son, keep on fighting
For our Uncle Sam
