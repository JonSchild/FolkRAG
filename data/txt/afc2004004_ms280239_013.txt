6) He's no made up o' many words, nor kent to puff and lee,
But just as keen a little chap as ever you did see.
If you be in search of harvest work upon a market day,
Tak' my advice, be there in time, and look for Willie Rae.

7) Now we hae gotten't in about, and a' oor thingies ticht,
We gather round the festive board to spend a jolly nicht.
Wi' Scottish song and mutton broth to drive all cares away,
We'll drink success to Rettie, and adieu to Willie Rae.

8) Come all ye jolly Rettie chaps, a ringing cheer to all,
A band of better working chaps a gaffer never saw.
So eager aye to play their part, and ready for the brae,
'Taw you that made the boatie row, 'twas steered by Willie Rae.

The Jolly Miller:
1) I am a jolly miller cam' frae the mill o' Sallock,
AND if you do not know me, my name is Willy Sprock.
I play upon my bagpipes wi' mickle mirth and glee,
And I care for nobody, no not I, and nobody cares for me.

2) First when I came here aboot, I'd too much for to do,
Wi' grinding corn and shearing grass baith late and early, too,
But noo the harvests over and I maun lie my lee,
And I care for nobody no not I and nobody cares for me.

3) Wi' carrying heavy burdens, my back's inclined to bow,
Wi' carrying heavy burdens, my back's near broke in twa.
But nature has formed the                  for a pinch o' this nation's brew,
So I care for nobody, no not I, and nobody cares for me.

4) Me mill's got new machinery - it's somewhat strange to me,
It's of a new construction as every my eyes did see.
Gin I twa arms around her and a pinch o' the brown drappie,
I'd care for nobody, not not I, and nobody'd care fo me.

5) I'm engaged wi' Doctor Ramsay, he's Laird o all our land,
And when that he does call on me, I am at his command.
Some people say he's quarrelsome, but he never quarrels me,
So I care for nobody, not not I, and nobody cares for me.
