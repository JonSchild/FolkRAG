how in later years they became
peddlers' wagons from which
Conestoga cigars, now called stogies, were
hawked.
   Like a good novel, the D. A. E. 
starts off with a bang. Here is the
very first quotation, illustrating the
letter A and taken from the Maine
Province and Court Record for the
year 1651:

   Its ordered that Mis Batcheller
for her adultery shall . . . be
branded with the letter A.

   Clearly New England was no
place to commit adultery. Actual
branding passed, but as late as 1837
Nathaniel Hawthorne was writing
in the Salem (Mass.) Gazette how
astonished he was to find "a young
woman . . . whose doom it was to
wear the letter A on the breast of
her gown. . . ." The theme haunted
Hawthorne for many years, until
in 1850 he published The Scarlet
Letter.
   Creation of an American language,
the D. A. E. discloses, began
as soon as the Mayflower reached
Plymouth. To parcel out land in
the first American subdivision, the
Pilgrims decided to cast lots. Thus
a man's ground became his lot.
Most Englishmen will still look
puzzled if you say: "I've just
bought a couple of lots on Main 
Street." But Miles Standish would
have had a pretty clear notion of
what you meant.
   Each part of the country similarly
added to our store of words.
   
   Pioneers picked up Indian words like
wigwam and moccasin; Spanish
words from Florida and the Southwest
spread to Maine and Minnesota —
bonanza, ranch, tornado, to
name a few. Others journeyed still
farther — barbecue and hammock
from Haiti, chinchilla and tapioca
from South America. Still other 
words got into the American language
from nowhere: like Topsy,
they just grew. Witness guyasticutus.
   The guyasticutus was the most
ferocious, rambunctious wild animal
ever exhibited under canvas.
For only ten cents, ladeez and gentlemen, 
you can come into the tent
and see with your own eyes this
horrendous beast. But no one except 
its proprietor, alas, has ever 
actually seen the guyasticutus. For
just when the crowd around the
entrance has bought the last ticket,
the proprietor rushes out of the
tent and roars, "Run for your lives,
ladeez and gentlemen! Escape before
you are swallowed alive! The
guyasticutus has busted loose!"
   The late Professor George Philip
Krapp of Columbia University 
collected many such animals, not
found in any zoo. A sort of 
lexicographical Frank Buck, Professor
Krapp penetrated the densest jungles
of American prose and brought
back rare specimens such as the
kickle-snifter, which lives in old
men's bears and circular lakes; the
snowshoe-hooved swamp gaboon;
and the prock, or side-winder, or
side-hill badger, whose legs are shorter
