If you will write to Jan Syrjala, 250 West 14th Street, New York,
who is my own sound technician, I believe he will be glad to purchase 
and check the recording equipment that you want. He will
probably not ask any fee, but in your letter make it clear that
you would like to pay him a fee for his services. You also have
an Ampex dealer in Memphis and you might be able to get a reconditioned 
machine through them.

There is nothing to do about the Ollie Gilbert sort of guys,
and I am much too busy and full of songs to bother with the
matter myself now.

It is always great to hear from you. Please write again when
you have time.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
