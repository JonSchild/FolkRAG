                                                 MEMORANDUM

TO THE                                                              FROM THE Division of Music
            LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS                                            MAY 9, 1936

REFERRING TO Request of Dr. Lomax

       Pursuant to the request of Dr. Lomax, attached, I should like to
     recommend that payment of $500 be made to him out of the current Carnegie
     grant. This grant, incidentally, was for $4,500, as against $3,000 in
     1934; $1,500 is still available, Mr. Voorus advises me.

                                                                                                      Oliver Strunk
