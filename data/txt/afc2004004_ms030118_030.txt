      (Pat:  It cost $250.)
     It's a Gibson.  Yeah, it's a Gibson.
     (Bernie:  My, that's a fine looking guitar.
     It cost me --
     (Bernie, interupting, Just look at the wonderful wood
that they put in, and the work that goes into it.)
     (Pat:  What kind of wood?)
     (Bernie:  What kind of wood do they make guitars out of?)
     (Me:  They make them out of maple and fir. . .?)
     (Bernie:  Th a t doesn't look like maple.)
     That's spruce pine.  (Rev. Davis tries again)  THat
cost me two hundred and fifty --
     (Bernie:, cutting him off, Wonderful gui tar.
     -- three dollars and eighty cents.
     (Bernie:  You think you'll get two hundred and fifty
three dollars and eighty cents worth of us o ut of it?)

     (Bernie:  You'll get it, over a long period of time.)
     Oh yeah!  It'll double.  It's goin to pay fur it comin h eah.
It's got a noble sound, ain't it?  Ain't it, Miss Elizabeth?)
     (Me:  It has a beautiful sound.)
     (Pat:  Play us somethin, Rev. Davis.)
