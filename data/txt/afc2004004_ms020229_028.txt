crop, y-your cotton an' corn."  Got it ready, you know, to harvest.
Then.  Start some kinda hell witya (with you), you know.  "Ya done
this an' ya done the other."  An' some of 'em come at nights an'
say, "You said so-an'-so to Mister So-an'-so an' he didn't like it."
Jest any old thing.  Jus' any ol' thing. . ."An' don't say ya didn't.
Don't 'spute my word."  All the ol' kinda stuff, ya see?   Tha's all.
Just sumpin' to start sumpin' that way an' then you gotta -- "Ya
better be left here by tomorra."  If not, they burn a cross an'
put it in front of ya do', see?
AL:  And what does that mean?
BJ:  That means, "You better move.  If ya don', we'll burn ya up."
AL:  You mean, if they put a cross up there. . .?
BJ:  Put a -- If they make a cross an' burn it.  You know, jus' act
like -- It look like it's been burnt.  You know, I don' mean burn
it up.  They burns it jus' to let ya know that hit's, hit's been
on a fire.  An' to let you know that, that you better move.
An' when they put a cross in front of ya there -- Colored folks,
some of 'em build nice homes in diffrunt places, an' they go an'
set a cross there.  An' you -- an' they scared to stay in they
house then.  You'd better to move.  'Cause hit mean hit
gonna burn ya up.  Somebody gonna burn ya out.
AL:  They're gonna burn the house down?
BJ:  Tha's right.  That's what it mean.  That, that's the reason
I let ya know it's so much diffrunt from St. Simon.  You don't
hear talk a nothin' like that.  In Savannah, an' all places like
that, I don't care want them colored folks build, rice growin',
all the way 'tween Savannah there, nothin'!  An' Jakel Island an'
all, in there, no-nowhere.  I don' care what they -- Ya ain't heard
talk a kinda mess like that.
