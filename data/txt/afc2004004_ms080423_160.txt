First car I got was a little old, one of these here little old
T-models, you know.  And it had beltin' (?) around things, you know, and you
had to push one pedal and then hold it, you know, to get it agoin',
you know . . .                                                      put off of it and get
it in high and then you had to . . .
to go backwards, you know.  And the brake point (?), you know,
had worn down but mine, the belts got bad in it, and I went and
cut Dad's . . .                      up.  You know we had a gristmill, we
always kept gristmills.  And I cut part of his. . .                         up
and then tore it up and relined my things . . .        you know, so
I chugged up a mountain and goin' off a mountain, me and my wife
one day . . .                                                   I was tryin', you know,
never drove . . .            show off a little bit, you know how a 
feller is, you know.   Had an old wire fence up and I was talkin'
to her, you know, kinda reachin' over, you know, reachin' . . .
little bit, next thing I knowed we went through the wire fence.  I
push that pedal in there, you know, to get her stopped, you put
. . .gas down, you know and you spark . . .
. . .                                                and pushed my pedal in and backed
out and this man come out and he says, "what in the hell you doin' in
my field(?)"  I said, "Well, I guess I just wasn't payin' no
attention."  He says, "Now you fix that fence back.  If you don't
I'll follow you."  So I told him, I says, "I'll be back."  Meanwhile,
. . .                                                        a meal then, you could get
your pork meal 35 cents and . . .       50 cents, and these overhalls you
could buy them 45 cents, and now they're about $17.  So, I went and
fixed his fence back, you know . . .
