REPORT ON "RUMORS"

Since the last report was submitted on August 8, a great
number of contacts have been made with people in this area, but there
are no rumors being circulated to my knowledge.

However, as suggested in your communication of August 5,
I will continue to keep track of any rumors I may hear and make
reports from time to time as circumstances justify.
