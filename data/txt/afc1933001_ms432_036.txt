[*8*] FUNERAL MARCH.

DY-ING AS SOL-DIERS FIGHT-ING FOR LA-BOR SO DID YOU
FALL, AN OFF-SPRING OF YOUR LOVE FOR THOSE WHO SHARE THE
STRIFE, GLAD-LY YOU GAVE US TA-LENT AND TREASURES YIELD-ING YOUR
ALL, THE HON-OR OF THE WORLD YOUR FREEDOM AND YOUR
LIFE. DEEP-LY YOU SUF-FER'D, NOR SHRANK FROM THE GRAVE;
JUDG-ES AND HANG-MEN, THE FATE OF THE FRAY;
STARV'D IN DARK DUN-GEONS, BEAT-EN AND TORTUR'D
CHEER-FUL AND BRAVE, DE-FY-ING CHAINS AND JAILS YOU
MARCH'D UP-ON YOUR WAY. L.L.
