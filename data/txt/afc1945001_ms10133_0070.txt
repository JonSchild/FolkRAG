Why is it that the Negroe solider who does something great in the fight for our country never is made ?? When a White soldier does something his name is always put in the headlines in the paper and usually his picture in the new?? in the morning picture but a Negroe soldier does not get any publicity whatever? Because of prejudices. 

Why is it that we are trying to fight against Hitlerism and we do not fight against Jim Crowism? Why is it that a White person always ?? out the bad side of Negroes but does not look at the good side of him?

Why is it that a White soldier does not want to salute to a high ranking officer of the negroe race? 

Why is it that everybody regardless of race creed or color can't eat in anywhere they want to?
