Bessie was rotten in that stuff!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hah, hah!
         Now, don't tell me that suff don't change yo' disposition!  
It changes ya, ya hear?
         An' Richard -- sick as he was -- we comin' on back home.  I 
said, "Well, I gotta walk home."  Th-they say I walk with my 
shoulders up when I got whiskey in me!  So, ha, ha!  But I know 
I gotta walk home.
         An' so, Clara said, "Me, too."  She was fat an' big, ya know.  
She jus' walked. . . !  An' she wobble[ed]s [up ahead] anyhow.  But I, I [walks] wobbles,
anyhow, ya know.  [Walks with the peoples there.  I'm talkin'] People think I'm drunk when I ain't.
['bout Miami. But] 'Cause I walked all over the place but I never could 
coast (?) y-ya know, 'cause I cain't walk that, that straight.
         An' so we wen' on back home an' met Richard 'way up there 
about 2 blocks from home.  Got up to [him] a telegram post.  {I]
"Ain't that Richard?"  You know, he was sick, ya know.
         I said, "I b'lieve that's Richard."  An' so.  He was stoopin'.  
[(?)] I said, "That's Richard!"
         Us went on over there where he was.  An' so, I looked [at 'im] there 
'fore us got to him; he was out there talkin' to the telegram 
post.
         "He went right here!  Right here where he went!  He went 
right down here!"
         Said, "This boy, this boy's crazy, too."  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  
Oh, Jesus!
         I said, "Richard!"
         "I know where he went.  Don't tell me nothin'; he went right 
down here."  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Hah, hah, hah!  Oh, [Lawd] God, it's a 
day!  Hu, ha!
