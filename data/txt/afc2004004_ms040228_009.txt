7                          A Rosy Apple

[*one girl*]        A rosy apple, lemon or a pear, 
                       A bunch of roses she shall wear,
                       A golden bridal by her side, 
                       Chose the one to be your Bride.
[*2nd girl*]
                              Take her by the lily white house
                              Take her by the water 
                              Give her a clout, 
 [*one goes out*]  And push her out
                               For she's the millers daughter.

        [* Lovely*]
