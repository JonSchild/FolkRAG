Mr. Archibald MacLeish
Librarian of Congress
The Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

My dear Mr. MacLeish:

I have just been listening with the greatest pleasure to the 
School of the Air Broadcast given by Mr. Alan Lomax.  It was the
first time I had heard this program and it fits in so well with
a cherished hope of mine, that I am taking the liberty of writing
to you immediately.

As you of course know, the annual meeting of the American Library
Association is in Cincinnati this year, the week of May 26.  The
Children's Section has the responsibility for three programs, all
of them widely attended by librarians in different fields of
activity.  I have been hoping that we could get one speaker, at
least, whose subject was akin to the locale.  I had thought of John
Jacob Niles with his dulcimer (or dulcimore I believe he calls it)
and his Appalachian songs, but he is better for a more intimate
group than for an audience of probably a thousand or more.

Is it possible that you would be interested in allowing Mr. Lomax,
together with anyone else he might need to supplement his part, to
appear on the Cincinnati program during the convention week?  The
Section is able to pay a moderate fee as well as traveling expenses.

We have had in our own library a small success with ballad programs
for young people and I know that to have a real personage on the 
subject would be a great delight to librarians and would leaven the
lump of professional talks.

I shall not say anything about the time until I have your answer
and I shall hope that if you do not think this feasible, you will
have some other suggestions.

Sincerely yours,
Lesley Newton
