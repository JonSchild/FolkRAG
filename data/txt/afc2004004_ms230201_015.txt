Natchez:  That's true.
The Kid:   We didn't know how much we were getting' an' maybe we 
                get twenty-five cents a day, so when we gettin' ready
                to leave, they say, " Well, you owe me four h[o]undred 
                dollars.."
Natchez:  Sho, sho.
The Kid:    ... I mean, for eatin' an' sleepin'.
Natchez:   An then , suppose you be workin' a team of mules an'
                 one got his leg broke an' you have to kill him---
                 that's yo' mule.
The Kid:    Then you work the rest of your life...
Natchez:   Yeah, you bought that mule.
The Kid:    You gonna work right on till you can slip off...
Sib:           Why don't you say somethin[g] about it?
Natchez:   Wha-what you gonna say about it?  If you say anything, 
                 maybe you go like the mule.
The Kid:    Yeah, all odds [are] are against you.  Even your own people are-uh..
Natchez:   Yeah, ['cause] the white men don't all the time do those
                 things.  It's some of your own people at times will do
                 those things, because they're told to do and they do what
                 they're told...But look here now, Sib boy, have you heard
                 any of those songs they sing on the levee camps?..
Sib:           No, I admit I don't have so much an idea about 'em, but
                 then I heered my uncle tell about how they used to 
                 gamble...
Natchez:  (Gently ribbing him) Well, looky here, Sib, have you ever 
                 shot craps in your life?
