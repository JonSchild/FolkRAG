Miss Helen Waterhouse
104 Burton Avenue
Akron, Ohio

Dear Miss Waterhouse:

At last the troubles with my recording machine seem
to be at an end and I am able to say that I shall start for
Akron within a week or ten days to make records for the folk
song collection in the Library of Congress from Captain Nye. [ * X * ]
I shall bring along with me the list of the titles of the
songs that he knows, which you have been good enough to send
me.  In the meanwhile, won't you have him practice up on the
tunes of the old ones.  You understand, of course, that I
wish to record only those songs that have no standard published
tunes or such noted songs as Barbara Allen, the House
Carpenter and others that have been handed down by word of
mouth for so long that the tune varies with the individual.

I am also particularly interested in any of the
songs connected with or descriptive of the life on the Erie [ * X * ]
Canal.

It will be a great pleasure to meet you and Captain
Nye and I feel that these contributions to the Library of 
Congress will be most interesting.  He will be given full
credit for anything he does.

Won't you let me know if now is an altogether
suitable time for me to make the trip?  I shall travel by
automobile and bring my machine in the car.

Very sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax
