DATA ON JOHN A. STONE (OLD PUT)

Compiler of Put's Original California Songster

John A. Stone, more commonly known as "Old Put" was an indefatigable
collector of songs that the miners liked and sang.  His purpose
is stated in the preface to Put's Original California Songster:

"In dedicating this little book of songs to the miners of
California, these hardly builders of California's prosperity
and greatness, the author deemed it his duty to offer
a prefatory remark in regard to the origin of the work and
the motive of the publication.

"Having been a miner myself for a number of years, he has
had ample opportunity of observing, as he has equally
shared, the many trials and hardships to which his brethern
of the pick and shovel have been exposed, into which
in general they have so patiently, so cheerfully and even
heroically submitted.  Hence, ever since the crossing of 
the Plains, in the memorial year of '50, he has been in
the habit of noting down a few of the leading items of his
experiences, and clothing them in the garb of humorous,
though not irreverent, verse.

"Many of his songs may show some hard edges, and he is free
to confess that they may fail to please the more aristocratic
portion of the community, who have but little sympathy
with the details, hopes, trials and joys of the toiling
miners' life; but he is confident that the class he
addresses will not find them exaggerated, nothing extenuated
nor aught set down in malice.

"In conclusion he would state that after having sung them
himself at various times and places, and latterly with the
assistance of a few gentlemen, known by the name of the 
Sierra Nevada Rangers, the songs have been published at the
request of a number of friends, and if the author should
thereby succeed in contributing to the amusement of those
he is anxious to please, enlivening to the long tedious hours
of a miner's winter fireside, his pains will not be unrewarded."
