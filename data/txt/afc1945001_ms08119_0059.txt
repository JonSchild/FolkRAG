A fellow from my neighborhood is registered
at our local draft board.  He went to Omaha,
Nebraska and worked out there for five months.
While he was out there he was called to
appear at the draft board.  His parents
were elderly and unable to work.  The
draft board told him that if he goes
back to Nebraska he will have to be
drafted.  So he stayed in Chicago, and
now has a job in a defense factory.
