THE BUZZARD LOPE

REFRAIN:
Throw me anywhere, Lord,
In that old field.   (2)

Don't care where you throw me, (REFRAIN)
Since King Jesus love me,  (REFRAIN)
Don't care how you do me,  (REFRAIN)
Since King Jesus choose me,  (REFRAIN)
Don't care how you treat me,  (REFRAIN)
Since King Jesus meet me,  (REFRAIN)
You may beat an' hang me,  (REFRAIN)
Since King Jesus save me,  (REFRAIN)

Throw me anywhere, Lord
In that old field.  (2)

     One dancer, representing the buzzard, places an object on
the floor.  This object represents carrion.  The buzzard keeps
his eyes on it, walking toward it and then back -- zeroing in --
pretending that he wants to make sure the object is dead.  Then
he jumps quickly to it and snatches at it as if plucking out
its eyes, etc.  It is important that the buzzard use a quick foot
twist similar to a buzzard's walk, dance with the whole body,
and near the end of the dance, to slap his hands against his
thighs as if chasing off dogs.  He then jumps over the carrion,
picking it up with his teeth and, without touching the ground
with his hands, swings the carrion around in his mouth and
walks off with it still in his mouth.

     The song is repeated until the dance is finished, but should
end as above.
