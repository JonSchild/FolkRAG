A regiment was crossing a desert in
India.  One soldier got lost from the 
regiment.  He found no food nor water
for a long time; finally he staggered
into a small village.  Faintly, he told
the people there that he was hungry
and thirsty.

One many asked him, "Haven't you
eaten at all since you left your camp?"
"No," answered the soldier.
"Didn't you have your rations?" asked
another.
"Yes," answered the soldier.
"Well, why didn't you eat them?"
inquired a third.
"Well, in camp the sergeant said
never do anything until the command
was given, and I was waiting for the
command."
