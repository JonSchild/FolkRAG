tree.   An' his haid layin' agains' the tree.  It's            Mama and 
myself so much that I hate to look at it.    An' he, ah, around his feet 
you can also see -- 'a course they about fade away, 'cause all of
'em dead, you know, like him -- but the dawg standin' there with 
his tongue out of his mouth, an' the men standin' there.  One man
standin' there with a gun, his arms folded with the gun in his 
arms, lookin' up at the tree.   An' some more standin' around.  
There was three of 'em [was] standin' [next] at the tree when the putchur. . .
TL:          You got that picture. . . . ?
BJ:           I got it right there, but you can't hardly make 'em out 
so good now.   See, this was done in 1909. . .An' I still got it. . .
You know one thing?   All of this whole 25 years I was away from 
home, I would pray to myself often times, I hope I find Son's 
pitchur when I get home.   'Cause [I] we lef' Mama an' them home --
I mean my Gran'mother an' them home -- an' didn' know where -- 
what happened, you know, in 25 years.   An' ah so, I jus' 
wishted that.   So I did find out that [Son] someone was there, an' I went 
back up there, an' I went in Mama's [ol'] -- that ol' big [fancy] thing she
[that they have, whatdoyoucallit] have there; they call it a wardrobe thing, ya know -- I 
went in there an' I [found my old] looked in there at different things, an' I 
found my ol' Ko -- old pitchur-takin' thing, you know, [old]
 telescope thing, you look in, set pitchurs in it an' look 
through it an' all -- I found that there, an' there I found Sonny's 
pitchur among those telescope pitchurs.   Boy, I was so glad then!  
An' she said, "Robert's pitchur oughta be in there somewhere."  
I said, "Might be maybe rats [chewed] have cut it up."   An' the rats [took the] had tipped off a 
lil' off the end there.   That was all!   Right at the end where it 
wouldn't hurt.  An' I rubbed it up good an' carried it on with 
me, so I still got it.   Mama never seen it but once in her life, 
an' that was the day she took it out the post off-- out the mail 
box.   An' she fell at the mailbox; Mrs. Johnson an' them had to go an' 
get 'er.   So she never see it no more.   Outa that whole time, it was 
in ['till] 1909.
TL:          What did your family do when they got that picture in 
the mail?
BJ:          Um!   I said, Mama fainted!   That was a time.   So she never
looked at it; I keep it now out where she['ll] won't never see it.   She
come to the house now, she don't [ever] know it.   But it's in that
