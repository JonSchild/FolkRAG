Dear Alan:

Thank you for your letter and the program of the Lead Belly concert.
If you still have use for the Lead Belly records and have not mailed them, why not keep them for a longer period. I am glad you enjoyed the meeting and I imagine Stith's will be another good go around.

With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
