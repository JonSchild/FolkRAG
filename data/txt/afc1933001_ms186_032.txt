Professor Ralph S. Boggs
Box 625
Chapel Hill, North Carolina

Dear Doctor Boggs:

Thank you for your note about
Professor Posnansky. I am working on it
and shall let you know if anything comes
along. If any more projects like this
come to your notice, shoot them on to me.

I have not yet heard from Mr. Frank
Duffey, although I have written him asking
for a brief informal report. Please ask 
him to write me because I have heard one
slightly disturbing report about his
activities.

Best regards.

Sincerely yours,
