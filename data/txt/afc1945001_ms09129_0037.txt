I heard that:
1. The Red Cross is crooked.

2. Hitler is dead.

3. Hitler and one of his officials were out riding in the 
country one day. By chance their car ran over a 
farmer's dog. Hitler was feeling in a good mood so 
he told the man to go and tell the 
farmer about the dog. Pretty soon he came back 
loaded with all kinds of fruits, vegetables and fowl. 
Hitler asked him what had happened. The man 
had said, "Heil Hitler, the dog is dead."

4. At Curtiss Wright the people have nothing to 
do. They just lie around and draw a big 
salary.
