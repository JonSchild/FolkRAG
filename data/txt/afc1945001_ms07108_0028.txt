[Overheard in Drug Store:] This conversation had been underway and was overheard at the following point: Man "A" was discussing Jewish people, and said that they will make trouble after the war because most of them are prospering at the present time, and they will resent surrendering part of their earnings in anticipated post-war high taxation. Man "B" agreed and mentioned trouble in Jacksonville colored section Sunday, where police reserves were required to arrest negro as prevention from attack with knife [*4*] upon a negro woman, and a group of negroes attempted to prevent arrest. [Jacksonville, Fla. 8-5-42] [*Florida*] [*C6727[?]*]
