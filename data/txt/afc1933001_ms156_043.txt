My dear Mr. Allen:
I am writing you in response to information I received from Edith Little 
Ofterdahl, who is now residing here.

Charleston, West Va., is a city of approximately 75,000, a great many of 
whom are interested in civic music and May Festivals, but to date there is 
no organized effort to encourage Folk Songs and Dances. We have a new 
Municipal Auditorium seating 3,500, with a back stage that will seat 1,500 
and this is used as a small auditorium or for additional seats for conventions, 
etc., when room for 5,000 is needed. The seats on the back stage 
are folding chairs, and Mrs. Ofterdahl said that the size and arrangement 
would make it possible for you to put on the type of program you arranged 
at the Forrest Theatre. 

A local group, of which Mrs. Ofterdahl is a member, is already meeting regularly, 
and this group with, perhaps, Aunt Mollie Jackson, Wood Guthrie, 
Margo Mayo, Lead Billy, under your direction, could undoubtedly put on a 
program that would be very popular. I hope this would result in the demand 
for organization of many such groups throughout the city. 

The local broadcasting stations have offered their facilities. Does this type 
program interest you? Do you think we have the means of making it successful? 
What would be the charges for your services and for those with you?

I should appreciate your reply as I am anxious to make some plans along this 
line.
Very truly yours,
Betty Heavener pen R
Mrs. C. Paul Heavener
Director of Recreation
