ROLL TO HITLER'S RU-I-IN

In Amsterdam there lives a maid;
Mark well what I do say:
In Amsterdam there lives a maid,
And fighting fascists is her trade;
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.

Chorus: We're rolling, we're rolling,
We roll to Hitler's ru-i-in,
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.

We landed on Old Ireland's shore,
Mark well what I do say;
We landed on Old Ireland's shore,
And the we came ten thousand more;
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.

We landed on Old England's ground,
Mark well what I do say;
We landed on Old England's ground,
Five hundred thousand Yanks around;
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.

We beached our ships on Algiers' sand,
Mark well what I do say;
We beached our ships on Algiers' sand,
And there we fought them hand to hand;
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.

In Africa the know [feel] know our might,
Mark well what I do say;
In Africa they know [feel] know our might
And the Yanks have just begun to fight!
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.

In Europe soon we'll strike our blow,
Mark well what I do say;
In Europe soon we'll strike our blow
And every fascist then will know
We're rolling o'er the ocean to you, fair maid.
