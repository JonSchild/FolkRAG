"this war has really got me worried. I just learned the
other day that an American businessman who had just returned from
a trip to Canada claimed that the Canadian war effort had bogged
down. He said that in his travels through Canada he found that
Canadians were living as usual, and apparently were not very much
concerned about the war since the United States had become involved. There seemed to be a general attitude that the United States code
carry the war effort."    [*39*]
