Professor John Harington Cox
University of West Virginia
Morgantown, West Virginia

Dear Professor Cox:

    The Library is sending me to the
meeting of the Hoosier Folk Lore Society in April
in Indiana, and since my route lies across West
Virginia, I should like to drop by and call on you.
I have found your book extremely useful in connection 
with my work here at the Library in cataloging 
folk songs, and I have many things I should like
to talk over with you.

    Do you think there is any recording 
we might do in or nearby Morgantown that would
prove interesting? I shall have the Library's portable 
recording machine with me. May I expect to hear
from you soon?

    Sincerely yours,

    Assistant in Charge.
