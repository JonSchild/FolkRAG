unexpected journey in front of ye. You don't know you're
going. But look out - there's trouble ahead of ye. And it
faces yourself because you're dark. Bust still, behind all
that you're going to be very lucky in money matters. And
you're going to get over your bad trouble with the very best
of heart here. The seven means money. . . .Now, make an
ordinary wish. Nothing impossible. . .Pull out eleven. You get
a chance three times. And if you do not get it then, you
never get it. . . Have you been in any way upset lately over a 
dark woman?
Lomax: Always. Is that the ace?
Jean: Is that correct? Don't tell me lies. This dark woman
faces you with the best of hearts here in a company. Here's
a bad card. Watch yourself! It's nae trouble. Watch that
ye dinna be father at the cradel! You've turned up the 
cradle. Dinna forget yourself, or you'll have that trouble
to put up with. . . . Was you thinking on a letter? There's a 
letter here and also here a fair amount of money. There's 
something that you're going to put over very, very well and 
very very soon. You've got good cards. . .  Have you been wishing
that you'd like to change your bed and go away?
Lomax: Uh-huh.
Jean: And a very, very long journey you would like to go
cacross water. You've turned it up here. It's been in your
mind all the time.
Lomax: But that's not what I wished for.
Jean: Take eleven again. Trouble. Have you been in any trouble
lately? There's a bit of trouble here. It's past. It could be
a while back. It could be years and yet it's still. . . .Trouble
that's past but it's still left its mark upon you. There was a
woman in it. Is there someone you thought a lot about? That
could be very close, very dear to you? It seems here that you
often can't help thinking or someone very dear to ye, and always
will be. I think you haven't seen the person sooner than you expect. I dinna
think it will be so very long. It is water that divides you
nd that person.
Lomax: Is the person dark or light?
Jean: The person that I see here, she is dark-haired.
Lomax: Doesn't that ace of spades mean that someone's going to 
die?
