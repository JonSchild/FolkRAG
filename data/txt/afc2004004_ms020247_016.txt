Reel 7, Song 7

THROW ME OVERBOARD, I FOUND A HIDING PLACE

CHORUS: Throw me overbo'
I found a hidin' place,
Throw me overbo'
I found a hidin' place.

CHORUS: What's the matter now?, etc.

Lawd, they wonder what's the matter,
Why the Church can't thrive,
There's so many members there
Totin' about lies.
(Lawd,)

CHORUS: That's what the matter now, etc.

Then God sent Jonah
To Nineveh land,
Said, "I want you to go there
"At my command."

Jonah decided
That it would not be,
Then he made up his mind
That he would run away.
(Lawd, an')

CHORUS: That's what the matter now, etc.

CHORUS: Run away from God, etc.

Oh, Jonah walked down
By the tidey shore,
He met up with a ship
Makin' ready to go.

He paid his fare,
Laws, he got on bo'd
Then the ship went driftin'
On down the shore.

Lawd, the wind did blow,
God, tempest did 'rose,
Then it floated the ship
From sho' to sho'.

Captain on the ship,
He got trouble in mind
'Cause he wonder what the matter
That the ship wouldn't sail.

Then he sent for a man
To search the ship,
Lawd, he searched the ship
From bottom to top,
