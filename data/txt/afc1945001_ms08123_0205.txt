The rumor started in
a small tailor shop when a 
soldier came in and ordered 
three uniforms for tropical 
weather. The soldier told the 
tailor that if they were not 
ready by 10:00 o’clock Friday not to 
send them.

That night at dinner the 
tailor told his wife that a convoy 
must be sailing at about 12:00 
o’clock Friday night because 
the soldier had to have his 
uniforms by 10:00 Fri night.

While he was telling this 
his son, a little picture with 
big ears was taking it all in.

The next day in order to 
influence an older boy
the tailors son told him what 
he had heard. The older boy
went home and told his mother 
that a convoy was sailing 
Fri night at 12:00 o’clock.
