Mrs. Rosa Warren Wilson 
Martins Point, S. C. 

Dear Mrs. Wilson: 
We are sending you, under separate cover, copies of all 
the records made by Mr. John Lomax of Plantation Echoes. 
Please use only fiber or composition needles on these records. 
Steel needles will ruin them! We are enclosing a package of 
composition needles for your use. These may be sharpened with 
an ordinary emory board as used for filing finger-nails. They 
may be resharpened and used again as often as you wish. 
Permit me to thank you again for your cooperation in allowing 
us to record this performance. 
Very sincerely yours, 
Acting-Chief, 
Division of Music
