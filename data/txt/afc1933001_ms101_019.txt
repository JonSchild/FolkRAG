Mrs. Phil Stone
Box 269
Oxford, Miss.
Dear Mrs. Stone:
I am greatly interested in what you tell me of the old Negro man who works for you. Will you please interview him and get the titles or typical lines of all the songs that he knows. If you will list these songs and send the list to me, I can then determine whether it seems worthwhile to drive to Oxford and make the records of his songs on one of the Library of Congress recording machines. If I find other singing Negroes in Oxford or up in the hill country, so much the better.
I once had lunch with David Cohn at the Athletic Club in Dallas, though I doubt if he remembers the occasion. I read after him constantly. Should I come to Oxford, my wife would probably come with me. She and I would of course be glad to accept the kind hospitality which you have tended us. And I am most grateful for your letter. I am a Mississippian by birth and know the Delta country very well, particularly the section including the penitentiary. 
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
