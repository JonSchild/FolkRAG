Needless to say, the same approach can apply to other
cultural vehicles than radio. I believe that it is highly
important for the Library of Congress or some other government
agency to take the same approach in the field of the documentary
film ad soon as may be.  This has been already discussed
in some detail so that I need not go into the matter
further.  I have an extensive memorandum from Joseph Losey
of the Documentary Film group in New York City in my files
if a statement of this kind has pertinence.  Another
field of enormous importance is the field of leisure time
activity so well cultivated by NYA and by the Recreation Program
of the WPA.  They are ready to use
folklore materials that are suitable for their
purposes. They need song books, records, transcribed broadcasts,
books of instruction in folk dancing and folk instrumental
techniques, books of dramatized American folk-lore of all sorts.

There is much for a folk lore division in the 
Library of Congress to do in the defense program and I hope
that we will not have to wait for another session of Congress
before money can be found to organize such a working
program in the building.  It seems to me that somewhere in the
special emergency funds or in the funds for the anti-Fasvist
battle that the foundations must be so emulating there could
be found the money necessary to initiate this program.
