Please Forward
Dear Miss Wyman, 
    Perhaps you recall that John A. Lomax and myself requested
the use of your "Lassie Mohee" from your "Lonesome Tunes"
in "American Ballads and Folk-Songs."  Recently, in
planning a recording trip to Eastern Kentucky for the Archive
of American Folk-Song, Library of Congress, it occurred to me
that you would certainly be able to offer some valuable suggestions,
perhaps a supply some names and addresses of good singers or
of people who know how to find the best singers.
   As you perhaps know the Library of Congress has been building
up an Archive of American Folk-Song, made up of manuscripts, cylinder
and phonographic recordings of American folk-songs.  It is interested
in preserving, as the transcript in some ways fails to do, the manner and
voice of the singers of old and new folk-songs.  The present survey
of the Eastern part of Kentucky will alow me to spend two months in
the mountains there, and I sm sure that your suggestions will be
invaluable.  I note that your songs come from Knott, Harlan, Jackson,
Estill, McGoffin.  Letcher and Pulaski Counties.  Which of these sections
do you suppose to be the richest?
   May I hope to hear from you before September first at which date
I leave Washington for Kentucky.

 Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge
 Archive of American Folk-Song
