Built me a house in Baltimore,
16 stories high, 
Every story in my house
Full of chicken pie.

I'm goin' up on Grabble Dick,

   "      "        "  on Grabble Dick,
And marry Miss Betsy Finely.

I will have my fun, my love,
"   "       "      "     "    ,
Take my glass away from me,
I don't want no more.
