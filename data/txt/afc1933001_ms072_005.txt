Mr. John A. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

After having had so much trouble in getting
your trip to Washington approved, I hesitate to
recommend this other trip to Chicago. Aside
from the financial situation which delayed the
approval of your trip to Washington, I really
think that you will be more useful to us
remaining in this vicinity. There is so much
to say about our folk song activities that I
cannot begin to tell it to you by letter.

Your trip has at last been approved and
official papers will be sent to you soon. I understand
from Alan that he is working out an
itinerary and attending to all the details. When
I think back to the day when I wired you that
I expected a favorable solution in the near future,
I begin to shudder but when you come here I shall
explain it all to you and you will see I acted
in perfectly good faith.

With best regards,

Sincerely,

        Harold Spivacke
