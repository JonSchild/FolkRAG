Mr Allen Lomax
Dear Sir.
I was glad to have your answer to 
my letter, but while I am anxious to 
preserve these old songs, I may not be
able to help. I have no Piano im
my home. My sight is so poor that I 
seldom leave my room. I am 
quite feeble too, IO am having a 
letter written to my daughter 
living in Elcampo, Texas.
A Music Teacher, there, he may emember
the old songs, and [confr?] the 
music to them for you, if she 
were home and I could sing them
