A LIST OF AMERICAN FOLK SONGS ON COMMERCIAL RECORDS


         After listening to [s???] three thousand [?] odd commercial records
of white and Negro songs and tunes from the South, I have compiled this
list of three hundred and fifty representative titles in order that the
interested musician or student of American society may explore this
[?] unknown body of Americana with readiness. [Thexlis????] The choices 
have been personal and have been made for all sorts of reasons. Some of the
records are interesting for their complete authenticity of perfromance;
some for their melodies; some because they included texts of important or
representative songs; some because they represented typical contemporary
deviations fax from rural singing and playing styles of fifty years ago;
some [?] [?] to make the list [?] [?] [?] as nearly 
as possible typical of the material I have examined. [?] I know that I have
heard only a quarter of the [?] interesting records; for example I was
able nowhere to find a large group of R [?] Okehs or Gennetss
to audition. Many records have been passed over because at times the 
auditioning process has had to be hurried. But I have come away from this
listening experience with the certainty that American folk song music, 
[?] has been while certain folk-lore specialists have been mourning its decline,
has been growing in new directions to compete with "thick" commercial
music
           and that it is today [?] in its most "distorted" form
in a healthier condition, roving the radio stations and recording studios, than
it [?] has been or ever will be in the notebooks of collectors. No better
indication of this can be found than in the scores of contemporary ballads
and songs, some of them songs of protest, that can be found in this list. 
           Many of these records are out of print. It seems to be impossible 
in the present state of confusion that exists in the [?] files of commercial
recording companies to say which records are in print and which are not.
As a general rule the most modern records are the easiest to obtain.
              This list in a personal 
About each selection on the list the following information is given: l )
the label name and number, 2) the title of the song and the name
of the performers, 3) The type of song, 4) The instrumentation, 
6) [?] a remark about
the [?] authenticity [?] of the performance, 
of the text and the melody, 6) an/personal evaluation of the record, 7)
a reference to some other better-known title for the song. Space 
[?] limitations &space have forced me to set this material/down in 
the form of abbreviations. A list of the abbreviations used follows:
