LARRY:
Yeah, well Mrs. Davis, you know how hard I was studying up there in the Bronx and you know Brother Davis showing me cord after cord and he really was trying to teach me, and it seemed like to me I was just slow in learning I just couldn't get it as fast as I wanted to get it, and one day he told me he say Well Larry, he must have thought it was killing me to get it, and he say Well  larry it won't help you none to play like me, but it'll help you keep me in mind. It really was you know it just changed my whole my whole thought of playing, you know. And it helped so, to have an idol that you had something to look forward to, rather than try to be. You know just like that but going that some thing, you know. I think that was what he was trying to get over.
LIONEL:
That helped you.
LARRY:
Oh, yeah, it helped my music idea, it helped me to thinking you know, cause then he went on to explain to me how,  he told me once whereever I would go, if I would meet a better muscian to respect him for what he did, but then again, try to get something that he would respect me for just as well you know and its been a help for him to tell me that, keep him in mind and he'll always be there. Did he ever at anytime, say anything to you about how hard I was trying?
