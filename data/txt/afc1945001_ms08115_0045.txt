College — Sophomore — Negro — Female
One of the anedotes that I recall about the war is where I
read an article in the paper about the Negroes at War, and
some of the Negroes says that conditions couldn't be
any worse if Hitler was the ruler than they are
now for the Negroes.

2 Another anedote that I read in the newspaper
was pertaining to the W.A.A.C.'s where the husband and
wife were both in the Army. The husband being only
a sgt. and the wife a second Lt. He approached her
and was telling her how proud he was of her and she in
turn told how proud she was of him, and she was
waiting for a salute from him.

3 Another article that I have read is pertaining to
the W.A.V.E. and SPOR where at first they were
only taking the white ladies and now it is open
to both white and colored.
