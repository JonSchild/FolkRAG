RALLY SONG
Tune--Battle Cry of Freedom.
By North Dakota State Office
We will rally 'round the cause, folks,
We'll rally one and all,
Boosting the need of Org'nization;
We will answer to the call, folks,
We'll answer every one,
Building up the Farmer's Union.

Chorus--
The Union forever, for justice and right,
On with the program, on with the fight.
While we rally 'round the Locals,
We'll gather strength and might,
To build up a stronger Farmer's Union.

We will rally to the fight, folks,
We'll rally one and all,
Building the farmer's org'nization.
We will answer to the test, folks,
We'll answer to the call,
Building up the Farmer's Union.

Yes. we recognize the task, folks,
As being hard and long,
Changing an old established system,
But we realize that fact, folks,
We must correct the wrong,
And build up a stronger Farmer's Union.

SWEETEST LITTLE HOME
Tune--Sweetest Little Fellow.
Sweetest little farm home, everybody loves,
Donno what to call it, just a nest of little doves,
Smiling 'mong the treetops, with grass so shiny green.
Makes you think that heaven is pictured on the scene,
When the evening gathers, sunset o'er the hill,
Shadows come a'stealing, creeping long so still.
When the fire is dancing on the hearthstone bright,
When the flame is prancing, happy, glorious sight.
Sweetest little farm home, everybody loves,
Donno what to call it, just a nest of little doves.
Smiling 'mong the treetops, with  grass so shiny green,
Makes you think that heaven is pictured on the scene.
