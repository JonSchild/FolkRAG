of shorter articles, including negro stories, tall tales, comic yarns of the cir-
cuit rider and the Texas frontier,-(You shouldn't miss "Pie-Biter" by John Gould
of Wichita Falls)-, the story of the curse of Marihuana and other tales of equal
interest.  As if to add dignity where dignity is not needed, Professor R.A. Tsanoff
of Rice Institute, now President of the Texas Folk-lore Society, writes so the aver-
age reader may understand without a dictionary about "philosophy in Folk-lore,"
Indeed, in this handsomely printed and ilustrated book may be found material to in-
terest the entire family.  No Texas library worthy of the name should be without a
copy of Coyote Wisdom.

The man who has made this book possible, and thirteen others devoted to T
Texas and Southwestern Lore, is, as I have said before, J. Frank Dobie, writer, teacher,
lover of the open range, hater of sham and injustice, preacher and practicer of free
sp eech, a good fellow..  He needs a hundred patrons to he lp promote folk-lore work.
More than that number ought quickly to volunteer.
