(Mr. R): We have three modes of common time: 2 over 2, 4 over 4,
and 2 over 4. We have two modes of triple time: 3 over 2, 
and 3 over 4. We have two modes of compound time:
6 over 4, and 6 over 8. You should beat time regular and
distinct: down and up for common and compound time; down,
down and up for triple time. You should beat your time
distinct so people can see what you want to do. The only
reason you have leaders is to keep everybody together, that 
is the only purpose. One other reason for having a leader,
you get to choose different songs. If you were going to
sing them all the same way, there wouldn't be any point in
having a leader. A leader is put up here to try and keep 
everybody together. Accent comes on the first part of the
measure, first part on the right side of the measure bar.
In common time, it comes on the first, and third. In
compound time it comes on the 1st and the 4th. And in
triple time, it comes on first and third also.
A syncopation is where you have a shift of your rhythm, 
you have a short note before a longer note on the accented
part of the measure, and that's a syncopation. On the 
bottom of 15, you got a 1/4 note before a 1/2 note, and then
you got a 1/4 note before a dotted 1/2 note. A repeat mark is
a row of dots at the end of a phrase that you go back to 
the beginning, and sing that again. In lots of cases,
at the end of a piece of music, there'll be another repeat,
a row of dots, and you'll have a figure one with the row of dots the 
first time, going back to the middle to repeat; sing through
and omit figure one the second time and sing figure two.
