The Green Hills of Ireland:

1)  O the green hills of Ireland though far, far away,
My heart is still yearning the green hills to stray,
And wherever I wander, wherever I roam,
My heart is in Ireland, my dear Irish home.

2)  I know that in Ireland a dear mother prays,
The heavenly angels may guide me always,
And I know that she's longing for that day which I
To see once again her wandering boy.

3)  Her face, though it's wrinkled with many's the long years,
Many's the sorrows and many's the tears,
But here's no face under heaven I long more to see,,
There's no face under heaven that's dearer to me.

4)  The love of a sweetheart might sometimes prove true,
But oftimes it changes the old for the new,
But the love of a mother, that sweet, loving flame,
It changes no, never, for ever the same.

The Rambling Irishman:  Music
1)  I am a rambling Irishman, I've travelled the country o'er,
In the search of an occupation like I never did before,
I've formed a resolution and I pass it's a very good plan,
To take a trip to America and view that happy land.

2)  When I landed in Philadelphia, the girls all jumped with joy,
Says one unto the other, "There goes an Irish boy."
They wanted me to dinw with them and took me by the hand,
And the toast went merrily round the room, "Here's long life to 
an Irishman."

3)  The took me to a big hotel, it was there we spent a night,
The landlady's fair daghter for me took a great delight,
She never took her eyes off me while on the floor I stand,
She shouts out to her mother, "I'm in love with that Irishman."

4)  "Daughter, dearest daughter, what is this you are going to do?
To fall in love with an Irishman, a lad you never knew.
With his knapsack on his shoulder and his shillelagh in his hand,
"O mother dear, I'd roam the world with that rambling Irishman."
