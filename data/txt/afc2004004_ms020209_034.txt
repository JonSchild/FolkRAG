IS THIS THE ENEMY?

Kunlung Mountain (The abode of the blessed)
Rising straight into the air above the earth,
Lofty Kunlung, mistress of the world's joys
The three million jade dragons are soaring.

All the heavens are transpierced with frost.
Snow melting in summer,
And the rivers brimming over.
Men may become fishes and tortoises.
Who will judge us over a thousand autumns?
Who will confer punishments and favors?

I say to the high mountains:
"Why so high? Why so much snow?"
Could I but lean on heaven and draw my precious sword,
And cut you in three pieces,
I would send one to Europe,
The second I would give to America,
The third I would keep for China.
So there would be a great peace on earth,
For all the world would share in your
Warmth and cold.

Poem by MAO TSEÂ·TUNG
