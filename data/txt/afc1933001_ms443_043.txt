By this time, then, Lead Belly's attitude toward women had become
completely arrogant and domineering.  He kept one at home to 
to clean his house and give him comfort when the world
turned sour on him, and he believed that all other women belonged
to him by rights.  The truculent Dallas prostitutes had nearly 
chopped his head off because of his swaggering "I wouldn' give 
two bits for you," but he had learned little from this experience,
and in Marshall he
attacked a woman who turned him down. He got a
year on the Harrison County chain gang. 
The third morning Lead Belly noticed that the guard was 
surly. He saw the man bring his bridle rein down across the 
heads and necks of the men who didn't please him, and Lead Belly,
although he was sure that the way he worked would save
him from any ill-treatment, didn't like the prospect of being
hit.  No one had ever struck him and got away with it. 
Lead Belly 
spraddled his legs to see how much of a stride he
could make with the chains hampering, tightened his legs and 
edged slowly to the end of the gang.  The guard turned his back and 
yawned and in a flash Lead Belly was over the fence, tearing 
across the plowed field.
Fifty yards separated him from the gang before the chain clinked,
the guard whirled his horse, and whipping his Winchester from 
the holster, began to fire.  The bullets whizzed around Lead Belly's
ears and he forgot about the chain and the plowed ground.  He ran.
A seconds more and he was safe in the woods.
