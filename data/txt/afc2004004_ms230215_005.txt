You never saw such
a caper in yr laugh

They started off with
Death + Glory - then
they played Abide With
Me + then fell into
Roll Out the Barrel
__
You never such a
thing in your life -
we went hopeless with
laughter -
Harry[?] playin away
on out of his special time -
Peter trying to figure out of what 
was going on
Let me get clear of this
lot I'll never play
with them again
I cdn't play for laughter
