Fisk, 19.  6.

With the bald-head baby...

A:  Go ahead.  That's not all.

Went on home,
To pick that skiff.
Come on home,
Just a-pullin that skiff.

I got you.
Don't keep it.
Um, um, um, um.

Oh, lady, oh, lady,
With the bald-head baby,
My momma, my momma
Don't like to pull that skiff.
I got the roll,
Ride that skiff.

I got you.
Don't keep it.
Um, um, um, um.

Saw that cow
Pat your legs.
Momma gonna milk it
To kill you dead.

I got you.
Um, um, um.
Um, um, um, um.

With that stove,
To pick up skiff.
I come back home
Just a-pullin that skiff.

Um, um, um,
Um, um, um,
Um, um, um, um.

Satisfied.

Take a rocking chair to rock,
Satisfied.
Take a roll by roll,
Satisfied.
Take a song like this,
Satisfied.
Just to satisfy your soul,
Satisfied.
Are you satisfied?
Satisfied.
Satisfied,
Satisfied,
Satisfied,
Satisfied.

A zoot, a zoot, a zoot, zoot, zoot.
A zoot, a zoot, a zoot, zoot, zoot.
A zoot, a zoot, a zoot, zoot, zoot.
Are you satisfied? -p- Satisfied.
