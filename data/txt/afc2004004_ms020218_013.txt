[*BABIES -- GEN.*]

"I'm glad of that. I got 'em where I just put 'em in the bed."
So, before they just sit there and rock. There work need's to be
done, you see? They need to do this and need to do that. Maybe
need to go some place. You can't do it. An' everytime you ease 'em
down, they wake right up. 'Cause they hand trained, he hand spoiled.
He want you to hold him 'till he asleep. Not on'y to get him to
sleep; he want you to still hold 'im. When he get used to that
bed, he'll play, he'll frolic on that bed with toys an' his bottle
and eventually he'll [gin] go on to sleep. Jus' get 'im trained like
that, at a time.
   So that's why I never did...I like to rock, my baby, all 
right. So nice...
AL: How soon do you begin that kind of training?
BJ: You mean to trainin' chilrun to do that? Or you mean with
the chilrun?
AL: You don't start the first day?
BJ: Oh, no, no! You mean the first day the chilrun's born? Or 
like that?
AL: No.

BJ: Oh, a chile [when] where he a little bit of baby, tha's different. 
He don' know what it's about. But when a chile begin to be about
six months old, he's a grown baby, you know. He's not a grown baby
until he's six months old, you know. He's a grown baby, at six months
old.  An' then at twelve months old, then he's supposed to be growin'
[an] of understandin' of different things he might want. You know, he will,
too. He'll let you know when he don't wan'...he'll shake his head...
an if he don't like it, he'll spit it out...sphoo...let you know, 
you see? He have understandin' that he don't want that. Sometimes he
done got it so many times until he know he don't want it, he even let you
know by turnin' his head aside, an' like that. [He let you know.]
He got grown in mind of certain things, of understandin'. He come
in that way. An' then you can begin to puttin' 'im, to [beg] let him
know that he gots to go to sleep. From nine months on, on that way,
see? Around nine months you can start puttin' him to sleep and
let him know that he won't give you no trouble about sleepin'.
AL: Before that...?
BJ: You have to nurse him, of course.
AL: Before that, must you pick him up?
BJ: You nurse him. Yeah, you pick 'im up an' pat 'im. The
