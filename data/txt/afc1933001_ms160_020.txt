Mr. Alan Lomax,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Mr dear Mr. Lomax:

Replying to your letter of August 8th concerning pictures on the flyer: -

I am terribly sorry that you do not like these
pictures. This is really the only one that we have which is
satisfactory for the flyer, as the other photographs were not
suitable for this type of publicity material. They could undoubtedly
be used for other types of publicity, but this was
the picture chosen by our Publicity Dept. and everyone who has
seen it has been very much excited about it.

Already these have gone out to all committees
quoted and I sincerely hope that you will be willing to let 
the matter stand.

Personally, we thought it was a rather good
picture, and I am wondering why you object to it so strenuously?

I know you are going to be in town in connection
with the "Forecast" show. If you are going to be in before the
16th, when I leave on vacation, won't you come in and talk to me
about it?

Sincerely yours,
Isabel R. Scott
