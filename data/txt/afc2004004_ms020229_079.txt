(STORY:  THE MAN WHO SPOILED HIS BRIDE)
BJ:  He, he married this woman an' he thought so much of her; he
didn't want her to do nothin'.  Just sit right down.  An' not
even wash a dish.  He was ou-out on a farm, too, ya know.  Ya
know what a tough time he had.  An' she, he, he would cook her
meal in the mornin'.  Git up in the mornin', an' cook breakfast an'
his'n.  An' he'd make up the bed.  Best do all he could do that
mornin'.  "Now, don't you do anything."
     He'd go on to work until 12 o'clock.  Come in there -- they
ain' gonna knock off until 12 -- come in there at 12 o'clock,
he fix sumpin' to eat, for bof of 'em, see?
     An' ah, an' don't even move when he sweep the flo'.  Let
him move her feet.  'At's right; don't move.  When he come in to
tell her, he take up her feet:  "Mo' (move) ya little hootsie-tootsies,
honey."  Ha, ha!  Everytime he come:  "Mo' ya little
hootsie-tootsies."
     That thing went on until he got to where he was late gittin'
to work in the mornin'?  He was late gittin' to work after dinner?
The boss man began to git at 'im?  An' trouble began to come between
him an' his work?  An' he, heh, heh, heh, heh!, he come in
so tired an' sweat' he didn't know what in the world to do.
She set right there.
