stuff.
    SH:   They carried him about 30 or 40 miles from where he was hung
at /mhm/ to where they buried him at.   . . .grandpa says it's
around 30 'r 40 miles . . .               where bury him at down here at
. . .                     And they carried him from this side of Wilkesboro
and . . .                     and my grandpa were very small now, and I was
down there when we went down there with an old truck, a Chevrolet
truck with wooden spokes in it, and they showed me the tree where
they say he hung at, a white oak tree.   But the last time I was
back through there you built a new road through there and you had
pushed the tree out.   Now that was what it looked to me like, I
didn't see it . . .      tucked the road around it . . .              And
they told me now, my grandma said it, uh, this woman is the one
that killed the other one and he took the blame on himself.  Now
that's what we heared when we growed up.
    AL:   Most people don't even know any of the story.  Why don't
you tell us what happened.
    SH:   My grandma, she said it, uh, that he took the blame on
himself, you know, he din't want this woman that he was agoin' with
hung, and he took the blame of himself an' he was hung instead of
her.  An' they carried him, I was, I been to his grave.  I mean, we
went out there and . . .               beatin' on a rock, pieces off a
tombstone and took it with me.    It's about . . .            gone
. . .                   wagon train which come through there.  And, uh, I went
. . .                                       and my grandpa when he was livin' a very
small kid, I'd say 7 or 8 years old, and they stood there where
Tom Dooley's hung at.  So I've been back through that country-
