OH, MT. ZION

In the heavenly land, Oh, Mt. Zion
In the heavenly land, well it's Oh, Mt. Zion

Well, I just got over on Mt. Zion
In the heavenly land, well, it's Oh, Mt. Zion

Well, the ship turned over on Mt. Zion
In the middle of the sea, Lawdy, Oh, Mt. Zion

Well, John cried out on Mt. Zion
The fault's in my house, Oh, Mt. Zion

What's the matter, what's the matter, Oh, Mt. Zion
In the middle of the sea, Well it's Oh, Mt. Zion

Well, this old ship, well it's Oh, Mt. Zion
'Gin to reel and rock, well it's Oh, Mt. Zion

In the middle of the sea, Oh, Mt. Zion
Well, the fault's in me, Oh, Mt. Zion

Well, standin' on that, Oh, Mt. Zion
That mountain top, well it's Oh, Mt. Zion

Well, this old ship, well it's Oh, Mt. Zion
'Gin to reel and rock, well it's Oh, Mt. Zion
