Tape Roll 53 Stan Kicks' house 2

(AL) theworld showin' people how to live, aren't you Stanley....
Stan: Yeah, tryin' to tell them how to live, it's pretty hard...
AL: Stanley makes dulcimers, makes banjos, and anything with these hands
that can be made he can do.
Stan: Yeah, and you don't see these in a person's hands, they ain't been
doin' much.
AL: Right, those callouses...no, I won't show mine.
Stan: And there's an old lady one time, and this old man is goin' to see her,
wantin' to marry her. And she aid "Now, I'll have to look at your hands,

AL: Both sides really had to pull the weight in these mountains...
Stan: Yeah, they had to pull their weight or then they wouldn't make it.
AL: You had everything you needed here, but it wasn't easy to get it
always.
Stan: No, it wasn't always easy to get it.

up ground, we had to dig it up a lot of times...be so steep and bad we
couldn't plow. We hold down plows, try to hold 'em down the hills and stuff,
and it'd hit a rock, and the handles would hit you in the stomach and if
you didn't watch it you'd go overboard.
AL: Now it's always been an idea of mine, the reason that mountain dances,
in fact dances of people in many places where concentrated on the legs,
