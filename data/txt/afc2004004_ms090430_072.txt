Ownership Limitations

In some sections of the County the white population encourages Negro
ownership and in other sections it discourages and even prevents it. The Negro
farmer generally is able to buy land only when some white man will sell it to
him, and this sale is restricted to small holdings. In the district surrounding
the township of Arlington there is only one Negro landowner. Other Negroes,
including the principal of the school, have tried unsuccessfully for years to
purchase land. The one established Negro owner secured his land from the
courts during the World War. He is at present faced with the problem of losing
it because he cannot raise a loan of $326 to pay his taxes. No white person
will advance him this amount because he is not wanted as a neighbor, and no
Negro in the community has enough ready money to assist him. This is the
simplest method of expulsion. Back of the dissatisfaction of white neighbors
is the implied threat to the system itself in the presence of a Negro landlord
with tenants whom he encourages to vote. The Negro owner is accused of
disturbing the "good feeling which has existed between black and white" in
that section prior to his coming. The pressure for conformity and the desire
for tolerance are ordinarily powerful factors in making landlords, where they exist,
act and think like the white landlords.

In the districts surrounding Lucy and Whitehaven, Tennessee, land
ownership is encouraged, but Negroes are unable to purchase land along the
highway. One family in Whitehaven, owner of a large tract of land and leaders
