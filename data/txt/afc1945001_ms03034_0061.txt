SECTION IV
HOW MAY RUMOR BE CONTROLLED?

We have defined the problem of rumor, its extent, and its danger to national morale. What can be done about it?
Attack on rumor may follow the following lines.

(1) Rumor is untrustworthy, almost always false. No sensible person relies on it.

This attack is adaptable to many publicity devices. The Rumor Clinic is a good illustration. False rumors are printed weekly with clear and explicit refutation from unimpeachable sources. By pillorying a few examples each week, the lesson is brought home that rumors are usually false. Radio programs, feature stories, etc. may be adapted to convey this message.

(2) Rumor is an instrument of enemy propaganda.

This line of attack follows directly from the correspondence of current rumors with the axis short wave propaganda line. The pamphlet Sucker Bait illustrates this approach.

(3) Rumor are destructive of morale; it is unpatriotic and shameful to spread them.

This line of attack is closely related to the preceding, and like the above, is illustrated by the pamphlet Sucker Bait. This message, however, is adaptable to many other types of publicity, i.e. films, radio programs, feature stories, etc. 

(4) The person who spreads rumors is a foolish, vicious, or dangerous person. 

This was the theme of Mr. Blabbermouth, an excellent film produced recently by M G M. It is also the lesson taught by many of the posters issued by the British Information Ministry.

(5) Rumor mongering is a form of scapegoating, blaming the innocent for one's own troubles. 

This argument applied to the majority of rumors which follow the wedge-driving pattern. The pamphlet They Got The Blame by Kenneth Gould, published by the Association-Press of New York, N.Y. gives an excellent discussion of the psychological basis of scapegoating.
