to kill off Communism. The U.S. and Britain want Germany and 
Russia to kill off each other."

"Well, Roosevelt pulled another smart one. He kicked 
Elmer Davis 'upstairs' in order to get him off the air and 
shut him up. I guess the administration was afraid of what 
Davis might say." Indianapolis, August 7.

"There's going to be more rationing and every one 
knows it. Congress is just postponing it until after the election.

with the whole mess that I'm not even going to vote." 
Indianapolis, August 4.
