Dear Dr. Spivacke,
I spent Friday going over the two thousand 
Paramount records that are still left in the loft 
at Bloomfields.  As I understand it, it is the only large 
group of Paramount pressings left in the country.  Out of 
this group I chose two hundred and twenty five records--- some 
of them, probably not especially sifnifigant--- but, as the few samples I was able to play indicate, most of them are fairly 
important to the understanding of Negro secular music in the 
United States.  Quite a number are collector's items.  Bloomfields 
price is .15Â¢ (fifteen cents) a record and I, at least, can 
make them go no lower.  They are holding this group of records 
for me for a time, but naturally they would like to hear from 
you in this regard fairly soon.
My talk with Mr. Wolfert the other day makes it 
quite clear that he wants to present the library with the Gamut 
recordings and, besides, put us on their reveiw list.  He expects 
to hear from you in this regard before he actually mails the 
records.  I think their list of recordings is decidedly worth having 
in the music division since it includes only such items as 
have never before been recorded in the United States.  His final 
terms for father's work for him were---20% without any advance.
This week I shall run over the Vocalion material 
and try to look at the Decca stuff.  This, however, will be merely 
a formality on my part, so far as the acquisition of material 
by the Library is concerned.  I think it is important that we have 
everything they will give us and it is toward this end I shall 
work unless I hear from you to the contrary.  Hammond, by the way, 
plans to do an historical album with Jelly Roll.
I have been thinking lately about summer plans.  
The three items on my program that are fairly definite are:  1) The 
completion of American Ballads and Folk Songs---three weeks of 
straight work.  2) Visit to Miss Flanders in the early part of the 
summer.  3) Visit to the Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, lumber jack-song 
authority sometime before the end of July.  The dead line on the book 
has been set for the end of June--- will mean publication by 
next Christmas.  I should, perhaps, be able to visit Miss Flanders 
for two weeks beginning the last week in May, and then return to 
Washington for two weeks of uninterrupted work on the book.  [After]
That would mean that I could leave Washington for the West at the 
end of June.  I should like this trip to be more lesiurely than 
my other trips have been so that I could get somewhat better 
acquainted with the communities in which I record songs and besides 
so that I can make potential master recordings in every case.  What 
do you think of recording from this time forward on one side of 
the record only so that in the case of master pressings the other 
side will neither have to be dubbed off or lost?  One thing more--
I should like to see a little of the Southwest before I come back
