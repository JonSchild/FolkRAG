92. 

come sneering back, telling me that I was supposed to do like he 
say. I just told him that I wasn't one of them 'kin to kaint'
niggers. I told him that when I worked for the man that owned
these plantation - in the city, I went to work at 7:30 and quit at 
5:30 and now that I'm down here on his place, I'm doing the same 
thing. And I told him that I was spose to get $2.50 a day. He 
couldn't say nothing much, cause he knowed that I knowed the head 
man. Other niggers was so surprised that I was making money. 
One time, he tried to get me anyway, but I messed him all the time. 
Ha, Ha; I remember one time, early in the morning he come down to 
the shack. Knocked on the door, yelling "nigger, why ain't you in 
the field. it's past 7:30." I yess back, - man you wrong, it    
ain't no 7:30. He pulls out his watch saying, "Looky here, it's 
past 7:30." I say, naw man - at 7:3- I be's in your field, not a 
minute later. I pulls out my watch, it say six something. So he 
say come on lets go here to the store and see. I go jumped up 
in his car, and we goes up to a store that has an electric clock 
and he see's mine's right. I guess he knowed all the time."
