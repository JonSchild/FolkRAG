Dear Mr. Lomax,
Newly returned from Atlantic City, I find this letter 
was never mailed.  I spoke briefly there to the five thousand women
but did not stress anything one way or the other about co-operation
in their regions with the Library of Congress—though that is what I
strongly wish to urge, granted co-operation is not misused.
A state convention is now on and I meet the members to-night, at White
River Junction.  I’m really shocked that this letter was slipped under my
desk calendar and never came to you.  I cannot expect you will alter your
making up of the record of the music I first recorded, because you had the
data which stated it was earlier my “find”, when you wrote that letter to Mr
George.  I most tremendously wish the American Archive of Folk Music
was conducted so collectors COULD share their findings and addresses there!
Sincerely Yours
Helen Hartness Flanders
