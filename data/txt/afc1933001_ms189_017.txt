Mr. Theodore M. Finney
422 Cathedral of Learning
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. Finney:

It turns out that I am not going to
be able to come to the meeting this year,
but that Mr. Hill will read my paper. I
had planned my session mostly to consist
of playing excerpts from recordings, and
therefore it doesn't seem advisable to submit 
a paper at this time. You can obtain
from Mr. Hill in Minneapolis a copy of the
paper he will read for me.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
