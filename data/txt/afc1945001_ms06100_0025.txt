Two dry goods store merchants in Denver, August 6:
"I don't believe the Government is of the opinion that
the OPA will work. If they did they would give OPA people some
authority to crack down on offenders. They tell me the other
day a fellow put an out-of-state license on his car and called
on four automobile dealers in Denver, told them he was a tourist
in need of tires and at each place he was offered new tires. Now
if the Government would crack down on a few of these people the
rest of them would get into line but dealers seem to feel that
maybe the Government isn't in earnest." [*(24)*]
