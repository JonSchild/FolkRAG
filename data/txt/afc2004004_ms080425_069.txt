Tape:  #224 Sacred Harp    p. 4

AL:  Were you up in Sand (?) Mountain when I recorded there years ago?
MRS:  No, I wasn't up there. . .
AL:  Lonny Odom was a master of mine. . . .
MRS:  I know the name is familiar. . . but I wasn't up there that time.
How many years it been since you were up on the mountain and made
that tape?
AL:  1957 i think it was.
MRS:  I don't think we were there at that time.
AL:  (unintelligible) :  alto part. . .
MRS:  Well, I like to sing alto because I don't have a high voice, I  can't
a treble note, so, alto is low, kinda like the bass part, therefore
I love alto the best.  It's mostly sung by women, it's not but a few
men that has a very, . . . .if they have a very low voice they sing
bass, they don't sing the alto.
AL:  Do you like to lead?
MRS:  I don't like to lead, I'd much rather sit on the bench and sing
and not get up and lead.  (technical)  Once you learn alto its kinda awkward to 
sing the tenor part, the lead part.

AL:  Mr. Rogers, have you been in the Sacred Harp movement a long time?
MR:  Yes sir, yes I have.  My father was very much interested in it, he
had a lot stronger  voice than I have, he was a strong, large man with
a strong voice, he could really sing!
AL:  Did you go every Sunday?
MR:  Most every Sunday; we don't get to make every one, but we seldom
miss one.
AL:  What is the music about, what does it mean to you and your family?
