Dear Mr. Lomax,
Many thanks for your card 
quite a lot of our folks who 
used to sing the songs have 
passed away in recent years.
We have the Oddfellows 
dinner here on Wed. 27th & we 
may have a few of the old 
type here but I dare not 
commit myself to say more 
than we should be very pleased 
to see you here anytime & we 
would certainly do all we 
could if you thought the 
visit would be worth your 
time etc.
