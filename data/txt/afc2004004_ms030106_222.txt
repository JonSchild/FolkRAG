as well quit in Chicago.  Earl got along very well with
Wolverine and King Porter and Milenburg, but he could not
seem to understand the key of G where The Pearls was wrote
so I helped him out every night.  He was a very poor reader.
I did this for gratis.  Earl was playing with some good
musicians in a small company and knew every tine he made a
mistake, almost every time he played a chord.  Earl sounded
good by himself, but he never failed at any time to make an A flat chord
against a G which the band would have.  I continued to help
Earl until he got angry with me.  There was a lot of jealousy
because people would applaud for me to play.  That was Earl's
first invasion in the city of Chicago.
