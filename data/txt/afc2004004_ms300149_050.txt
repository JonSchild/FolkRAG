Dear Alberta,
I am sorry that you did not understand
the arrangements about the money paid 
to the singers for the records. You
see, these records are being made by 
a small company here in New York. There 
was a small advance payment paid for each
record to be divided among all the singers
on each record, and also to pay me for 
my time and expenses and equipment in
making and selling the record. That
didn't leave much for each person, but 
some people got more money than others
because they were on more songs. Naturally, 
those that led the songs got
more than those -- like you--who were
in the chorus.
Alberta, when all the money was divided 
up, some of the people -- like you and
Emma -- ended up with not very much because 
you were not on too many songs that
were chosen for this particular set. So 
I took the little bit that was left over
from the record advance and gave it as a 
"bonus" to the people who got very small
checks. Although your check was only 
$15.00, you actually got more money per 
song than the singers who got larger 
checks.
I hope you will understand this and that
the records will sell well enough for us
all to get more checks some days.
Sincerely,
lan Lomax
