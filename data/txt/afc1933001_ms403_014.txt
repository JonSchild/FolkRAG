HENRY TRAVILLION - page 2

at home us sing spirituals now and church hymns - short meter, common meter and
long meter - mostly long meter." [*Play 3973 (A-1 or 2 or B) 3972 B2)*]
Just at twilight - what Henry calls "fust dark" - only a few months ago - I called
with my recording machine at Henry's comfortably furnished home of four rooms.
He owns this house ( and a nice little farm which he and his children cultivate).
His wife and four children and a tiny baby girl, recently adopted, sat around in
the front room where I set up my machine and listened to Henry talk and sing
through a long, happy evening. I recorded many songs as well as several interesting
chapters of his life's story. He sang a spiritual which began:

"When the roll bees called in Heaven
I'll answer to my name - "

Henry commented - "Yes, I'll answer all right but I don't care how far down the
list my name is. I ain't homesick yet and he can jes skip my name when ht comes
to it. But the Lord" - he went on - "is set so high and I'm set so low and de
Lord knows what he gwin' do'fore he starts."

Lullaby got to sleep 3973 B6*]
