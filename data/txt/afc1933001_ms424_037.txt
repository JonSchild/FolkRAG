THE LITTLE CUDGEL
(Russia)
(Page 193 - Folk Songs Vol. II. G. Schirmor.)
Many songs have I heard in my dear motherland
And they told me of sorrow and joy.
But there's one song I know I shall never forget
'Tis the song of the men as they toll;
Refrain: Hej! my little cudgel, onward!
Hej! the green one will move onward, now
Together, together,
Move onward!
Oh! the English are wise, to help labor along
From the water and fire they borrow,
But our Russian moujik, when his work is too hard
Will intone in his need and his sorrow:
Refrain: Hej! my little cudgel, onward!
Hej! the green one will move onward, now
Together, together,
Move onward!
When the old father dies, to his sorrowing son
He leaves as a blest inheritage,
Long forbearance and patience with hard-hearted fate
And this song for his toiling and grieving:
Refrain: Hej! my little cudgel, onward!
Hej! the green one will move onward, now
Together, together,
Move onward!
