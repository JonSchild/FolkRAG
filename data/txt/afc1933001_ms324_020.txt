Directions. The group is in line, facing the "Duke," who moves forward
toward the line and back singing the odd verses. The group answers in turn with
even verses, advancing toward the "Duke" and retreating to starting point. In
verse 10 the "Duke" and the one chosen skip around in a circle. They now start
over again. "Here comes two Dukes a-riding," etc. Have only groups of 10 or less
