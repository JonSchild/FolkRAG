Marine vs. Army
A buck private in the army was
talking to a private in the marines.
The army private said that, "the army
has gone through tougher stages than the
marines. We got to be so tough that
we could catch a cannon ball. The
armless regiment they use to call us."
"Thats nothing," said the marine. "When
my company was on Guadacanal we
really had a tough time. One day
I went out on a scouting party of
five. We walk dead smack into a
trap. Behind us in trees were snippers,
in front of us was a Jap machine gun
nest, to the right of us was advancing
Jap scouts, to the left was another
machine gun nest." "Well what happened",
said the army private. Then the marine
look up in suprize and said, "O we were
killed.".........
