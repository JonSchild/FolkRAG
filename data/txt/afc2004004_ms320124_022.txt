BARRY ANCELET  -21
LOMAX . . .Louisiana for a long time.
ANCELET  That's not the only one by any
means.  And you can imagine in a case like that how much
Dennis learned about the blues and how much Amaday learned
about Cajun style.  And that's, that's learning one on one.
So when they went off and played their own music for
recording and that kind of thing you heard influences of all
the sources.
LOMAX  Well I profoundly believe that
there was a, there's a big Indian trace in this music, too.
We'll talk about that perhaps at another time.  But I think
the main point here is that we have the first, we have in
the case of Cajun music the most, the, the biggest piece of,
the biggest piece of musical jambalaya, the most Creolized
kind of American music with [Sibero] Indian influence, with,
with the black African influence, with many kinds of 
European influence, both Mediterannean and north western
Europe coming together to make the, the sum of the, the sum
of the human race.  And, and that's why I think this sound
is beginning to, you know, knock on the doors of the world
now for the first time.  And. . .
ANCELET  And it was the blending, the
blending of all those things into something brand new,
something [that is a], American, Louisianan.
LOMAX  [Lost my place.]  Yeah.
