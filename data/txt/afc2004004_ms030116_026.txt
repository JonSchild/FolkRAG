in the dark will be in the dark.  Men that would rather be in the
dark would rather admit darkness than walk in the light.  Men
that are spiritual-minded always look for light; men that are common
minded always look for darkness.  Every true-born chile have desires to
be among people that are children of God.  Thass where we git this
idea of goin to churches, swappin words wid one another, 
an singin, listenin to the pr ayers of others, an you prayin, give
