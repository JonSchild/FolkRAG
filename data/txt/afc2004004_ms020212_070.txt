B Jones

April 5, 1963

Dear Alan,

I an sending herewith a small sampling of Bessie Jones
transcriptions. Should they meet your approval in general, I should
be able to finish the whole thing up within a month; all are done in
first draft. I find, however, that the second drafting is the hardest
and longest; there are lots of mistakes and problems that I didn't
catch the first time round. This is the first day of Easter vacation;
I intend to go ahead and finish the whole thing during this next
week; if you have time to look these over carefully and send me posthaste
any reactions, corrections or general criticisms I will be
able to start copying soon. I realize it's extremely nervy to ask
you to speed things up when I have sat on this whole project so long;
my work day is so extremely fragmented any kind of concentrated effort
is extremely difficult for me -- not a very good excuse, I'm afraid.

There seem to be a great many things I do not know about musc;
also, a great many things I am not at all sure of on this particular
job. Maybe before you go over the songs it would be useful for you
to have an idea of my basic decisions on how to transcribe
these particular songs.

1) Bessie's tunes seem to revolve almost exclusively around
the major triad and its related minor; a total of four notes with
an occasional passing tone.  For example, her essential scale
is C E G A (with an occasional D thrown in); the A and G are taken
both above and below the C. Three factors keep this extremely simple
melodic structure from being dull -- rhythm (both in the melodic line
and the accompanying clap and pat patterns), variation of the melodic
line which, though keeping within the simple scale, of astounding
imagination, and tonal attack which varies again constantly.

2) Taking the last element first, I have minimized my
attention to this for practical reasons; there just don't seem to be
many ways of indicating this that aren't extremely confusing to the
reader. I have included just those grace notes, slides, etc. that
seemed to me to give character to the tune; on a few tunes where she
plays round a lot with the third note of the scale, I have put in a
foot-note to this effect, rather than indicating it as a blue note
by some system or another. In these cases, too, unless she hit the
third note flat in a purposeful and repeated way, I have written
the major interval; it seems to me the basic tonality of Negro
music in general is major rather than minor. By now I don't think
she often sings anything you could describe as a definite "blue"
note; she slides around so much it seems to me a question of attack
rather that part of her scale system.

3) On variation, I've tried to cope with this in several
different ways (outside of the usual brief indications). In many of
the tunes, I've transcribed two verses; the first is the essential
melodic line (I hope); the second includes as many of her variations
as I felt could be gotten into another verse and still sound like a good
song. In publication, I'd like to indicate in some way that any of
the variant phrases in the second verse could be moved about into the
first verse structure (does that make sense?); but in case people can't
or won't do that, they still have two good singable versions of the
tune. I intend to transcribe one of her tunes of this type all the
way through to show just how she builds a complete song. In the above
