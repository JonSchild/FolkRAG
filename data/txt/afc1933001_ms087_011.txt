44               THE READER'S DIGEST                            July
   In the midst of one operation, the 
assisting doctor giving the anesthetic
fainted. Soon racked with pain,
the poor woman on the table strained
and struggled.
   "Charlie, give her more ether!" 
called his father. Charlie tried, but
he was too short to reach the patient's 
head. The taller Will couldn't
drop what he was doing. Fortunately
a cracker-box stood handy,
and with it Charlie met the emergency.
   From such experiences, Will and
Charlie are said to have known
more when they entered medical
school than many a senior. Will
took his M.D. at Michigan in 1883,
Charlie at Northwestern in 1888.
But only death terminated their 
education. Both did postgraduate
work in New York, and after they
began practice in Rochester took
turns attending lectures and demonstrations
in Chicago. As the years
went on, they became surgery's
most indefatigable travelers, journeying
many times around the world
visiting medical centers everywhere,
teaching as well as learning.
   In 1883 a tornado struck Rochester,
killing and injuring hundreds.
Homes left standing were turned 
into hastily improvised hospitals.
The Sisters of St. Francis, who
helped with the nursing, were so 
impressed by the work of the three
Mayos in the emergency that they
offered to build a hospital for Rochester
if Dr. Mayo would take charge.
   "I'm too old," said the Little 
Doctor, then nearing 70.

   "Your sons will carry on," the 
Sisters told him.
   St. Mary's Hospital was opened 
late in 1889 with 13 patients. The 
first year and a quarter Dr. Will 
and Dr. Charlie performed 219 operations
during the mornings, attended
to their general practice afternoons,
and served as male nurses nightly.
Today St. Mary's is the largest of
the half-dozen hospitals independently
owned but affiliated with the
Mayo Clinic.
   The Little Doctor himself "carried 
on," for nearly a quarter of a 
century. At 87 he traveled alone
around the world on a trip of medical
investigation, and at 89 he toured
the clinics of Mexico. He died in 
1911, at the age of 92.
   As village doctors, Dr. Will and
Dr. Charlie divided their practice 
geographically. One took all the 
patients north and east of Quale's
Drugstore, the other took the rest.
Later they divided surgically, Dr.
Charlie taking all the territory north
of the abdominal diaphragm and
south of the pelvis, while Dr. Will
took the vital central region.
   Dr. Will was best known for work
on cancer of the stomach; Dr. Charlie
for goiter and other thyroid operations,
but actually both were almost 
"universal specialists." They published
more than 1000 contributions
to medical literature, covering an
amazing range; they were probably
the most prolific writers in surgical
annals.
   It was the Mayos' good fortune
