WHO STARTED THE GERM?
Once upon a time there was a
terrible spread of typhoid fever.
It just took the country side. It
was found that the famous Typhoid
Mary carried it around to
every one she contacted in any
way. So they took her and put
that troublesome soul in guarantine.
We are in an epidemic of spending
now and the disease of waste
will certainly wreck us. Billions
of dollars are being squandered
and wasted. The Typhoid Marys
are the politicians trying to perfect
their political machines
through waste and extravagance.
Of course they are abetted by
grafters who want to get something
for nothing. They are certainly
undermining the economic
health of the nation.
The apathy of the taxpayers to
the situation is the most remarkable
thing I have ever known.
Several billions of dollars. this 
year for non-defense projects 
which is more than double that of
'32 when no one could find a
job without trying to hunt for
it.
Remember this non war public
expenditures like money, men,
material and energy that should
be spent to preserve our life as
a nation. Yes, you might be getting
yours, big boy, in some way
of public graft but there is such
a thing as paying for it through
the nose.
THESE ADDITIONAL TAXES
If the government is going to 
live with only the idea of getting
the most taxes possible out of the
people for war purposes then it
should be for war purposes and
not for political machines. It is
certainly sound logic for the administration
to go in for an all-out
defense programs which 
means the carving to the bone non
defense stuff, waste and graft.
Furthermore just tagging an expenditure
as a defense project
don't justify its being.
As for those who take exception
to my line of thought, see if
this can be digested by you. I
think it was Jefferson who said it
and it runs something like this.
"In the last analysis, the only
force which will keep our government
at its maximum efficiency
is the liability to constant criticism
from out side sources capable
of giving such criticism."

Say "I saw it in The Daily 
Press."


to exchange rides with your neighbor, thereby making
your existing stock of tires, and his, last just
twice as long.
Let's say there are five neighbors on old Highway
No. 1, that all come up town at approximately eight
o'clock in the morning. Turn about could be taken
among the five. If two round trips a day are made
it would save approximately eight hundred miles a
month for those five cars alone.
In the case of those persons living at Friars Point,
Jonestown, or Mattson, the amount of mileage would
be proportionately greater, of course.
With the idea of getting people together and saving
mileage, the Clarksdale Daily Press again offers
its services. We propose to open a file in this office,
where those who would like to avail themselves of
such an exchange arrangement, can do so. Below will
be found a blank. Fill it out, and mail or bring it to 
us. It will show the time you have to make your trips 
to and from your business or other activities, and the
route you usually follow.
It will no doubt take some time to perfect this
proposition, but remember the tire situaion is growing
worse every day, and from now on will present
greater and greater problems, with no relief in sight
for the next two years.
You may have children who have to be taken
to and from school. It seems to us that this plan
would be most effective in solving this problem. Anyway,
we are going to give it a trial.
Each day we shall publish the number of persons
with their place of residence, desiring this exchange.
Their names and other details may be had by phoning
ou roffice, No. 33.
If you are interested, fill out and send in this
blank:
