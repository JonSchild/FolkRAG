Mr. C. engine left their _____?
He left there mighty hot, 
Got down Malone's trussle
[And] then wrecked the [certain] same spot

Well, said to M. Carrier 
"Don't you think it'd be nice
[Sell your foman] Send the fireman in Sardis
And get Doctor Wright."

Mr. C. says to Dave Coward
"Man, ain't you shame,
You done wrecked my seven spot
And scald[ed] the preacher's hand."

The Rougish Man - slower, but same  time,
Jack - they called him Jack Castle.  He stayed with
 a white man & worked so long till that's all I knowed 
about him. Jack Castle, raised right up there in the
 hills, south of ____ ? ____ . Done more than that.
 I just didn't get it all in. I could have put that 
record plumb out to the other side, but I hardly
 ever play that - I don't think of it much - he done more than that & every
 bit of it's in the song. He [sposed] wanted to be a bad 
nigger & he told me, "Aw -- By god, make one about
me - what I done."
He's dead now. A fellow killed him about 
stealing at last [?]. Up here at Pritchett.
