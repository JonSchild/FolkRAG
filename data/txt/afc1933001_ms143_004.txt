There were three crows sat on a tree 
[we'll under there all by law,] By law by law
As black and evil as crows could be. 
We'll murder them all by law. 

A knight was slain on ganders' plain 
Let's go and perch on his breast 
love. 
Let's go and [pick his eyes] sit on his heart 
love
and pick his eyes out aim by
aim.
