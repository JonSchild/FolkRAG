Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt
Livingston, Alabama

Dear Mrs. Tartt:

Elizabeth and I agree that our visit with you was 
one of the most pleasant on our vacation trip South. 
I wish we could have stayed for more of it.

I have not written you about our recording trip 
because the mills of the Library work grind very slowly; 
there is, however, a possibility of your doing a month or 
so of recording for us in your neighborhood in the fall. 
Would you please let me know what you think it would cost, 
exclusive of gas and oil, for you to do a month full-time 
field recording in your section of Alabama.

Father writes the usual ecstatic letters about you 
and everything that belongs to you. The movie project has 
for the moment fallen through, but these will continue to 
pop up as time goes on.

Very best regards from Elizabeth and myself.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
