You can't get people to fight when a soldier makes about $30 a
month and has to make all the sacrifices and a defense worker makes around [*7a*]
$100 a week and makes no sacrifices. There is a gross inequality of 
sacrifice.
Wholesale Automobile Dealer, Minneapolis, 8/12

When a man gets used to making 90 to 100 dollars a week and then
after the war he has to take a job at $15 a week, he will be resentful and [*7a*]
his attitude will be bad for the country.
Official of the Wholesale Tire Dealer Corporation

If the war lasts another year all businessmen will be bankrupt;
what with confiscatory taxes and increasing wages.

The decision to take the 18 and 19 year old should have been [*1*]
made already, because they are needed. The very thought of Congress waiting
until after election to call them is revolting.

They don't know there is a war around here.
Official of Auto Parts Firm, Minneapolis, 8/12

The President is to blame. He has not brought home to me that [*3*]
we out here are in a war.
Wholesale Tire Dealer, Minneapolis, 8/12

We don't know what is going on on the domestic front. Everybody [*3*]
is living as usual. We ought to be told about our danger and our domestic
problems so that people will be stirred out of their sleep.
Wholesale Radio Dealer, Minneapolis, 8/12
