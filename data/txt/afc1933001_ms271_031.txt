SIDE BY SIDE        (HULLABBALOO BELAY - ALMANACS)    (Dear Mr. Pres. Album)
                                                                                                                        '42
There stood a house upon a hill,
Hullabaloo belay!
Hullabaloo belah belay! 
And in this house eight men did dwell,
Hullabaloo belay.
One stood up and shook his fist,
Said,   "I'll grow stronger than the rest".
He first began to cheat and steal,
And then set fire to their field.
They turned their heads and let him be,
So then he upped and murdered three.
It made no difference where he stood,
He left a footprint red with blood.
He murdered three and wanted more,
He turned upon the other four.
But when this murder he did try,
He found them standing side by side.
Side by side they stood that day.
They left his bones to rot away.
This is the ending of my song:
One was weak but four were strong.
