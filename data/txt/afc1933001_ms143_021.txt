Dear Dr. Keppel:
In your note of the twenty-eighth, you considerably
referred to the program communicated to you in connection with 
our archive of folk music. I did communicate this to Dr. Stevens
also, with the inquiry as to whether the Rockefeller Foundation
might share the expense of it, estimated at a total of $39,500.
That was several months ago. It was, however, informal in the 
course of conversation, and though I left the document with him
I have had no indication of a definite consideration of it.
I am writing him today as enclosed.
Faithfully yours,

Librarian
