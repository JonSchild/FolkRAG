Dear Bess:

Elizabeth and I will be back in Washington by the 10th or 11th.
Perhaps that next week-end we can go to New York and try out the
boys at C B S.  I have written them all about you.  I think that
it might be a very good chance, although I haven't heard from them
yet.

You can reach me in the meantine in care of General Delivery, Salem,
Virginia.  I don'd know we'll all live since Elizabeth and I have
given up our apartment, but come on, we'll manage it some way.

I think the possibilities are here in the intervention section rather
than out in that isolation belt you've been living in.

I wish I could write all the news but there's too much to tell.  Cora 
is out being trained to kill poor innocent birds in Maryland.  Elizabeth 
and I have just finished the first laps of the Fisk field trip.

Write or wire, much love,

Alan Lomax
