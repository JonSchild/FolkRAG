FRIEND  Now (Draw Mamu), and Mamu, Mamu
Town, and (Big Mamu), and there are about four or five
(Mamus) here.  And I recognize the word from the (UNCLEAR),
with all the, you know, but half of them young people don't 
hear, they all seamen, all seamen or roughnecks or....
:      Yeah.
FRIEND  They work on the dock.
REED  ...all go to sheep.
FRIEND      And every time one of the
(UNCLEAR) among, and they like to (INAUDIBLE), let me tell
you, they work.  (UNCLEAR) Mamu, (UNCLEAR) work, not live
(UNCLEAR) someone from out of, out of state.
LOMAX      How did Mamu get to be the way it
is?  It's an amazing place.  I mean it's a kind of the
capital of the Mardi Gras.  And it's the, it seems to be the
capital of Cajun culture really.  It's the center of 
everything.  How did it get to be that way?  Do you know?
REED I don't know.  It's sort of a 
spontaneous, the, the very sound of Mamu I think sort of
attracts, you know, culture, a certain amount of attention.
I got a letter this week from, what's the capital of
Delaware?
: Wilmington.
REED  Wilmington or Dover.
:     Dover.
