stationed at this school and that white men are going to
do the menial jobs. There will be plenty of trouble if
that is the case. I hear that they have been having race

sent back while white boys are being accepted is making
the community pretty apprehensive over leaving most of
the colored boys here with white women while most of the
white boys are being taken." (Louisiana)
