THE SCOTTSBORO BOYS SHALL NOT DIE

Workers, farmers, negro and white,
The lynching bosses we must fight.
Close your fists and raise them high,
Labor defense is our battle cry.

Chorus:    The Scottsboro boys shall not die,
Scottsboro boys shall not die.
Workers led by I.L.D.
Will set them free, set them free.

By mass action we will defend
Our own class brothers to the end.
Death to lynchers we declare,
Frame-ups and lies to bits we'll tear.

Chorus:    The Scottsboro boys shall not die,
Scottsboro boys shall not die.
Workers led by I.L.D.
Will set them free, set them free.

HUNGER MARCH

We do all the building, Our hands all hte plowing;
And yet do we starve, Have no homes of our own, Have no homes of
our own.
We do all the weaving, Our hads all the sewing; O
Our work feeds the boss, We get only the bone, we get only the
bone.

Refrain:    March, March, March, see the masses anger flare
March, March, March, see the masses anger flare.
Forward march raise your clenched fist high
Forward march raise your clenched fist high
Hungry, ragged, cold and haggard,
Hear the steady sound of marching feet and voices
Rouse to struggle sound the call, In common cause unite.

Black comrades awaken! Come, steel your dark shoulders!
Your slave driving boss Our foe we meet face to face, We meet face
to face.
Strong red rows are mashalled, All comrades and brothers,
No terror, no lynch can hamper can slackern our pace, Can slaken
our pace.

Refrain:    March, March, March, see the masses anger flare
March, March, March, see the masses anger flare.
Forward march raise your clenched fist high
Forward march raise your clenched fist high
Hungry, ragged, cold and haggard,
Hear the steady sound of marching feet and voices
Rouse to struggle sound the call, In common cause unite.
