OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

Mr. Alan Lomax
Bureau of Special Operations
Room 22 Y Building
Office of War Information
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter of October 27 with further reference
to Mrs. Jakobson's project. We shall be glad to help
from here in any way that we can. Mrs. Jakobson, however, 
should come here for a conference with Mr. Dobie and
Mr. Micek.

I would suggest Bucknell University as your best sponsor
in Pennsylvania.

I wrote you last week concerning this project and I imagine
that our letters crossed in the mail.

Very cordially yours, 
Homer P. Rainey, President
