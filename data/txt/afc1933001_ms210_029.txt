nail down somewhere or, better, send
on to me the names and numbers
of songs hitherto unchosen that
should and must be included
in Ballads #2. I feel sure that
I shall agree. There should be
some significance in both words
and music, though the latter
seems to me far more important.
Maybe after January 1 I can
settle down to this job and help
you get it done.
Meanwhile do you two
do everything needful to make
[you] yourselves happy without the possibility
- be you heedful of bringing
harm to anyone else.
Lovingly,
Father
