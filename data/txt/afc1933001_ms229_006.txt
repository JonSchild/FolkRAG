Dear Alan: Henry Smith of O.M.U. 
took his Ph.D. at Harvard in 
June. He tells me that just before that 
time he was visiting a friend in
Northhampton, Mass., who was a member
of the Smith College Lecture 
Committee. Smith attended a
meeting where the "talent" for next
year was selected. Your name was
considered. When it was reached
on the list the Smith College 
Professor of Music [spokes] spoke earnestly
in your behalf, on the ground
that you were an [unconvested] unconventional
singer, that no one had told you
