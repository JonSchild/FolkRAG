HENRY TRAVILLION page 3

Henry has been a railroad worker for forty years. He has hadlots of White 
bosses - some bad and some good." Says Henry, "I couldn't hardly count de 
years I stayed bent down with a White man over me." 

He's been a mule-skinner in levee camps, a roust-about on cotton boats on the 
Mississippi River and also [he] as a levee worker cut willows to make mats to plug 
holes in the levee. In addition, he's had time - as a young man - to travel 
throughout the United States. From Henry, I recorded a genuine old Mississippi 
Roust-about Song - the theme of which runs -

"Poor roust-about - don't have no home - 
Makes his living on his shoulder bone - 
Up and down Big Muddy  - 
With my sack on my back - 
I'm going to make it to my shanty, 
Ain't coming back."
