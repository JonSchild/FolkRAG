To Study American Folk Songs

   Two girls from New Zealand,
globe-girding trippers in a trailer,
sue research into early American 
have paused in Washington to purmusic
among the collections in the
Library of Congress, and to talk 
with folklore authorities here.
   They are the Misses Betty and 
Joan Rayner, of Auckland. Recognized
as authentic scholars in the
folklore field, they have conferred
with Dr. Harold Spivacke and Alan
Lomax of the Library staff; Mrs.
Helen Harkness Flanders, Vermont
folk archivist, now in Washington, 
and Miss Sarah Gertrude Knott and
Maj. M. J. Pickering of the National
Folk Festival Association.
   The visit to Washington marks 
the last lap of their second circuit
of the globe in their quest for 
song origins, and they are amused
by the appellation "song sleuths"
which has been conferred on them.
"So apt and quite American," says
Miss Betty. They have done research
work in the British Museum,
in the Bibliotheque Nationale in
Paris, in Sweden, Czecho-Slovakia,
and Germany.
   The Nazi propaganda ministry
made the national collections available
to them, and hoped they 
would carry the German folk lieder
to other lands, because, he told
them, "it made for friendliness
among nations."
   "This remark was made before
the Second World War and it sounds
somewhat less than whimsical in the
light of today," said Miss Joan.
   Since last leaving Europe the 
young "song sleuths" have visited
Canada, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland,
and passed several weeks
