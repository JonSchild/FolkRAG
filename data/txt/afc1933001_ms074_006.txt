Dear friend John,
    I was glad and surprised to hear from you, and I am sorry
I can't do a better job of writing.For the last few years I have got
so nrevous I can hardly write but I do my best.The first contest I
can rememberhave having w as on a nice little creek near old Bever
City (about 5 miles) in the old neutral strip or naman's land, just
north of the Texas Panhandle. We was holding 2500 head of cattle there
on good grass and watter and 2 men rode up and asked to stop over
night with us and those days everybody was welcome. So they stayed
3 nights and 2 days until the horses rested up, for they was rode down
when they came and they had 2 sixshooters and Winchester each and wore
good clothes,shop-made boots and Stetson hats and was 25 or 30 years
old and never both slept at once. So the second evening while sitting
around camp some thing was said about singing and one of them said he
would sing song about with anyone. So the boss said that he had a kid
that he would sing against him. I was 20 years old.

    So after supper we hookes up. The other stood my guard from
8 to 9 and we song song about until about 10 p.m. Then he said,Kid,I have
sang all I know. Then the boys gave the cheers- there was no wager but I
got a thrill out of it. So they saddled up the third morning and bid
us the time of day,rode off.So in a few days we heard the Coffeeville
Kansas Bank had been robbed and we all thought them a part of the ones.
We never asked their names ,as that wasn't often done those days. I can't
remember any of the songs either he or I sang,as that was 50 years ago.

    The name of the boys was Ralph Church (the boss),Jack Leonard
and Short Allen,Les Laverty,Bell Fillops,Charley Straw,Billie Hill,and
John Laverty,the cook.

    I sang against a fellow in Weatherford,Texas, in a wagonyard.His
name was Ben Green,his and my friends done the matching of it for a
quart of whiskey.So we had quite a jolly time,about 30 min, and they
sure got a kick out of it. I beat him in about 3 hours.He said he had
never ben beet before.

    So I will close.Write again.Youre T.A.Hight

Don't forget the book
