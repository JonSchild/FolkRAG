Date: August 12, 1942
Place: Coffee Shop of the Burling Hotel, Washington, D.C.
I overheard two women who were talking from one table
to the other in the coffee shop in regard to the Federal
Government having taken over some of the hotels at Atlantic
City. One woman said: "I hear that the Government is paying
the hotels at the rate of $1.00 per day per room;" the
other said: "Well, I heard that the Government just took
over some of the hotels from the owners without paying
them anything and that seemed a very queer thing to me that
the Government would do that." [*204*]
