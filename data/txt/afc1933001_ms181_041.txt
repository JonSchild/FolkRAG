Newton Highlands, Mass.

Dear Mr. Brackett:

The Checklist will be sent to you in reasonably
short time, I hope. When you get it look under Hamilton
Ohio for various recordings by Peter Steele, in Hazard Ky. 
for Justis Begeley, in Salyersville Ky. for records by 
Ernest Williams, and in Gulfport, Miss. for Thaddeus C.
Willingham. These are some of the best banjo singers we
have recorded and you will find many others as you look
through the catalogue. We will be delighted of course to
fill your order for duplicates.

You should also look in old record shops for anything
by Doc Boggs and Buell Kazee on the old Columbia label,
for commercial records Dave Macon and Fade Manor on "Blue
Bird" also Coon Creek Girls on "Okeh". Write to Mary Lee
Guard in the State Department and ask for my index of folk
songs on commercial records which you might be interested
in having.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
