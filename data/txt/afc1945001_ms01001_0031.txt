Rumor control projects must not lead to witch-hunts.  Care
must be taken to avoid the over-simplified identification of the
rumor-monger with the Axis-agent.  Undoubtedly, there are Axis agents
spreading rumors.  However, most rumors are being spread by loyal
Americans.  These loyal members of the community must be educated to
the error of their ways, but the community must not get the feeling
that every gossip is an Axis agent, that their neighbor is living on
gold from Berlin or Tokyo.
Just as rumor control projects must avoid the conception of
Axis agents in every block, so too must they avoid giving the
impression of unsurpassable cunning in the enemy.  Attempts to show the
relation of rumors to Axis propaganda may prove very dangerous.  A
person who carelessly passes on a rumor and then discovers that it has
appeared on the Axis short-wave is likely to become very much concerned
about the source of the rumor, how he came to be "duped," etc.
It is undesirable for local rumor control projects (with
their limited facilities for such activity) to attempt to establish
their own check on Axis propaganda.  This service is available through
the Office of War Information, where a specially trained staff makes
detailed studies of short-wave broadcasts.
In some communities, particularly ports, war industry towns,
and Army camp towns, members of the community have an opportunity to
witness events related to the war effort.  It is obvious that these
items are of considerable interest not only to those who witness them,
