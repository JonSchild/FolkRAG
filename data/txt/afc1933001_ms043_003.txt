LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
WASHINGTON
DIVISION OF MUSIC

April 19, 1937

Dear Mr. Strunk:

I wish you would write to Professor Alton C. Morris of the University
of Florida, Gainesville, and tell him

1. that immediately on my arrival in Washington, I
turned over to the Library all the records that I
had made through his cooperation while I was in
Florida (Mr. Waters can give you the number of these
records).

2. that it is your understanding that no one shall
be allowed to make use of these records for some
time, to be designated by you.

3. that you request him to notify you when it will
be possible to ship the machine on to Washington.
(I think this request will at least influence him
to speed up his job.  As a matter of fact, if the
machine were here, I would take it out next week to
do some recording in Ohio. I shall certainly need it
very soon.)

Very truly yours,
J A Lomax.
