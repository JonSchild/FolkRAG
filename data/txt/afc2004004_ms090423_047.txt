                       Attitude Toward Town and Morality

      "When I was a girl I didn't go into town and stay out all of the
night.   Mothers just not raising their girls right; allowing girls to
smoke cigarettes, ride automobiles, drink. and do everything.   And the
church didn't say nothing about it. These younger folks calling themselves 
having a good time.   They drinks whiskey, they gambles, and they
goes to town.   Hasn't always been that way.   The folks long time ago
used to have spelling bees and things to go to right here in the
community, but since that town done got to be what it is, spelling bees
and that sort of things is too slow.
      What we got to do now is to git us something of our own, but with all
this new day - folk's just going.    I guess we all just people though.
Now folks used to go to the plantation store for everything from
tacks for shoes when you living to caskets for you when you dead.
Peoples goes to town don't have no need to go.   Some folks say they goes
to town cause you need a friend in more than one place.   People living
on a farm rather go to town than anything.   They want to go to town to
raise all kind of devilment.   And you know there ain't very much right
in our cities now.   There used to be special places to raise the devil,
now the whole city.   They got a class now that oughta be called the New
Rising Devil Class."
