Professor L. W. Chappell
University of West Virginia
Morgantown, West Virginia

Dear Dr. Chappell:

    I saw Thompson some weeks ago and he
told me that you had bought one of his field recorders. 
I should like to know what you think of
its performance, and whether or not you have found
it practicable for your field work.

    The Library is sending me to Indiana in
April to attend the first meeting of Hoosier Folk
Lore Society, and to do some recording in the state.
My route lies across West Virginia and I should like
to stop by for a visit with you. Furthermore, I
should like to know whether you have any suggestions
to make about recordings in West Virginia that I might
be able to pick up en route. Even if this work repeated 
something that you have done or plan to do, I do not
feel that a little duplication of effort in regard to
folk songs is wasted, since it is valuable to have recordings 
of the same song and the same singers made at
different times.

    I hope to hear from you soon [*in these regards*]

    Sincerely yours,

    Assistant in Charge.
