THE CALL
(Melody - Call Me Back, Pal O' Mine)

Hear the call, slaves of toil, may
our cause be your own;
Hear the call, help to free all your kind.
Let us stand then to win, and to claim
us our own
All we earn in the days to come.
Speed the day and the hour, feel the
thrill of your power,
Let us fight to the end of the way.
Let us help see it through with the work that we do
Hear the call of your kind, all today.

IF YOU DAM UP THE RIVER OF PROGRESS
(Words by E. Nesbitt. Melody - The 
Red, White and Blue, Columbia, the 
Gem etc.)

If you dam up the river of Progress,                   Whether leading the can of the fighters
At your peril and cost let it be!                             In the bitterest stress of the strife
That river must seawards despite you               Or patiently bearing the burden
'Twill break down your dams and be free          Of changelessly commonplace life.
And we heed not the pitiful barriers                  One hope we have ever before us,
That you in its way have down-cast;                   One aim to attain and fulfill,
For your efforts but add to the torrent,             One watchword we cherich to mark us --
Whose flood must o'erwhelm you at last.         One kindred and brotherhood still!

CHORUS:                                                           What matter if failure on failure
For our banner is raised and unfurled;       Crowd closely upon us and press?
At your head our defiance is hurled;           When a hundred have bravely been beaten
Our hope is the hope of the Ages,                The hundred and first wins success
Our cause is the cause of the World.           Our watchword is "Freedom" new soldiers
                                                                            Flock each day where our flag is
                                                                            unfurled;
                                                                            Our hope is the Hope of Ages,
                                                                            Our cause is the cause of the World.
