HOUSING

Real estate men have the damndest racket. They go from house to house ringing
doorbells and asking people if they want them to sell their house. They explain
they want them for war workers. Then they turn around and want a fee
from you for selling your house, and then want another fee for finding another
place for you to live. - Milwaukee, August 5   [*23*]
