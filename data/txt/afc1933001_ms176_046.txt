Dear Sir:

     I regret to say that I cannot send
a check for the statement you have just
submitted to me. My understanding was 
that my account with you is to be
settled as I make lectures under your 
management. The fact that the payment
for my last lecture was not sent to you
was due to my forgetfulness, and I will
send you a check for that portion of the
amount after the first of December.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
