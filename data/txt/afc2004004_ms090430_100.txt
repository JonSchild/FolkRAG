Dear Sir:

In this letter I am touching in more detail on some of the matters I have mentioned very generally in my report and am also calling attention to some other items pertaining to maintenance operations and to the financial record of this Board.

During the early period of levee construction most of the embankment was placed by hand labor generally by wheelbarrows.  In the early Eighties, however, slip scrapers and wagons came into quite general use for the long hauls required for the larger of the levees, and especially for bayou crossings and sloughs.

Prior to 1918 forces employed by the Levee Board to maintain the levee and keep it in repair and to do various pieces of light construction such as small enlargements, sub-levees, and drainage jobs, consisted principally of two scraper outfits of around teams each and of two labor outfits, one called the Boat Road and othe other the Mechanic's force.

The scraper forces were equipped with a supply of wheelbarrows and fresno scrapers, plows, a number of heavy wagons, a blacks outfit and such hand tools as were needed for clearing right-of  Each of the two Levee Board scraper outfits generally ran from 10 to 15 wheeled scrapers and carried a foreman and around 30 or more laborers.  These Levee Board outfits were not depended on for heavy levee construction.  That work was done in the early years under contract by contractors who hired station men to push wheelbarrows and later by contractor with large scraper outfits generally equipped with 50 or more teams.

The Boat Road gang consisted of a foreman and generally of 20 to 30 laborers.  It was equipped with hand tools for clearing,
