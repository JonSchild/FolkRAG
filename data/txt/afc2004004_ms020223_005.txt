BJ TAPE 7D, p. 3

(in Egypt?). An' so, ever since then, He put a division between
a woman an' a snake.                          All before
then, the women, they wasn' afraid of 'em.
TL: The ah, they put a division between the woman and the snake?
BJ: The woman and the snake. The Bible, it's in the Bible there.
See, um-hum...An' you catch a woman now -- You see a woman in these big
shows an' things [handlin']? Handlin' snakes? It ain't, [An'] it ain't very long before
she's...gits po' an' weak an' sickly...No doubt she soon die... Soon die.
Ya see, they got no business havin' them snakes with that woman,
no-o.                                                 snake.
Yes, she sure will. An' they is worry about me. I handle one
with a stick if I can. Hah!
TL: Do the men go after the snake?
BJ: Mens does, but                          more, more
natchully. No woman handle a snake.                       snake.   That,
that was the beginnin of this (sermon ?).I was jus' sayin',
this mess [man's] goin' on now -- 'co'se God was intent for it, ya know,
'cause the devil, he come out on that tree as a serpent, as a...
as a serpent, ya see. An' ever since then the Lawd said, "You
have feet like a man." Snake [They] used to walk upright, like, like a 
man. They were serpents. An' the Lord put a division between 'em
after that an' tol' 'em he shall crawl on his belly an' eat dust
for his livin', you see. So he does. But before that, he was
upright. He...I'm glad...Ooof! Ah!, he's not upright now.
TL: Man, hum?
BJ: Um, now. Before the               'bout that, hit'd be
bad, 'cause he'd be multiplyin' wit' women, ya know? Right on.
TL: He'd be what?
BJ: You know, tryin' to go wit' womens, you know.
