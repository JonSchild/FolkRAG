3) Now we had not sailed three leagues or more,
Before we spied ten men of war, 
Before we spied then men of war
And unto us they did huzzaw.
4) Come strike, come strike, you English dogs,
Come strike your topsail down by speed.
If you have a mind for to have them strike,
Come you on board, strike them for me.
5) Then he called up his merry men all,
Saying, "Get you ready and obey my call.
Get your firelocks ready and fix them well
And throw in plenty of bombshell.
6) Then he called up his cabin boy,
And sent him up aloft so high,
And there let fly King George's flag,
And under that we'l fight or die.
7) From the sun rising to the sun going down
We fight like enemies where we do meet,
From the sun rising to the sun going down,
We spied but one sail from the fleet.
8) Three we sank and three a burned,
The other three they ran away,
Andone we brought to old England's shore
To let them know we'd won the day.
9) So now thank God we have won this day,
We've caused the French all for to rue,
Here's Captain Ramsgate and all his crew,
let's everyone give a good huzzaw.
Lomax: O wonderful, really wonderful tune. What war is that of, Harry?
Cox: I can't. . . .I ain't. . .I don't know what it mean at all.
Lomax: Just a good sea fight, eh?
Cox: Yeah. Fight like the Old Dolphin.
Lomax: The Engish and Frencg used to do a lot of fighting, didn't they?
Cox: Well -- fight -- it was al fighting - hand over fist. That was all
you heard about then.
Lomax: Do you know any Franchmen yourself? Did you ever meet any?
Cox: No I don't know much about them. There's some French women come here
and got married. I had a cousin. His wife's French.
Lomax: What do you think of the French yourself?
