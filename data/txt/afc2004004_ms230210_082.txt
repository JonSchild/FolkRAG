Susan sortir Black Bay, i aller Laborie gagner sardine

[*Susan left BB, to go to Laborie
to buy sardines (food of poor)
Your house is burning.*]
I dit moin marcher.
Cho: E le le le le, etc. .
I marcher, i courir, i courir,
I heler, i heler, i trapper mal mâchoire.
Africaine ka marcher
Ti Congo ka marcher
Yo longer bords grande chemin ?
Ti Congo c'est liane douce
No longere pour l'honneur
Nous pas ni doit

La reine Victoria
C'est li qui mener Congo ici
Si ou[x] faire Congo la paine
Ou ka faire la reine la paine

Trans: Susanne left Black Bay, she went to Laborie to buy
sardines (the cheapest fish)
Her house caught afire.
She said "Ï walked, I walked,"
She ran, she ran
She screamed, she screamed, until her jaw pained her
Africans can walk
Little Congolese can walk
They pace the high road
Little Congolese are liane vines
They do not stretch their honour
We do not have the right

Queen Victoria, was the one who brought the 
Congolese here
If you cause the Congolese pain
You (also) make the queen unhappy.
(N.B. The slave traffic had virtually ceased when
Victoria ascended the throne!)
