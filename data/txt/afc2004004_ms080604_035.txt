And they'd say,
(singing:)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. . .
To keep me alive.
(speaking:)
Now that's when they would drive a mule,
they'd holler, "Get up a little bit". .

A.L.:
Show us how they'd drive the mules. .

W.B.:
Yeah.  They'd tell it, "Get up a little bit".

A.L.:
Would they sing different things to the mules
about gee and haw and. . .

W.B.:
Oh yeah!  They'd tell em, "Gee, (Mike?,
Knight?)", "Haw, Sadie". . "Get over there a little bit". .
"tsk". . "Hold it! -whoa.  Stop right there!". . . "Back up a 
little bit". . "Git up now!" "Tighten up a little bit". . I'd
say, "You ain't workin!  I'm gon whip ya!"  So I'd walk right
down there and take this line an hit the one that wasn't
workin.  Say, "Tighten up a little bit!".

A.L.:
Could you all three show us how you'd drive
mules an sing, each one of you sing a verse and talk to the 
mules and give us a notion of how that work actually went

W.B.:
Well, you see now I drove Emma near, Ada
swingin, Martha stickin.

Honey, you ain't doin nothin today" -now they knew who I was
talkin to, cos I petted em.  They'd get out in the pit and
they'd get up on a root, Martha would choke down, you know.
Well I say, "How you (unintelligble) so much?"  She'd get out
there an she'd stretch out, and her harness come up on her
back -she'd whinny, "Whoooo!".  I'd say, "Hold it. . uh, get
back there."  And I walk up there and I turn to Emma say,
"Emma", say, "You ain't doin nothin."  And I say, "Ada",
