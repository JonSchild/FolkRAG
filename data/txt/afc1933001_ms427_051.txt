LOCH LOMOND

1. By you bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes, 
Where the sunshines bright on Loch Lomon
Where me and my true love were ever wont to be,
On the bonnie, bonie banks of Loch Lomon'
Oh, ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low raod
And I'll be in Scotland before ye,
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Lock Lomon.

2. ' Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomonm
Where purple in hue, the Highland hills we view,
And the moon coming out in the gloaming
OH, ye'll tak' the high road and
I'll tak' the low raod, And I'll be in Scotland before ye,
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomon

THE LORELEY

1. O tell me, what is this sadness that fills my heart with woe?
A strange old legend haunts me, a tale of long ago.
The fading light grows dimmer, across the flowing Rhine (the Rhine)
While red with sunset glory the lofty mountains shine.

2. Upon a rock sits the maiden of wondrous form and fair,
In all her dazzling beauty and combs her golden hair.   while*)
A comb so bright and shining she plies and sings the while (the/
In Strains of wierd enchantment that hearts of men beguile

3. The boatman passing beneath her has heard that magic strain;
What pow'r can now preserve him? Alas 'tis in vain. (so Brave)
The waters deep have caught them, both boat and boatman brave, / 
'Tis Loreley's song hath brought them beneath the foaming wave.

CARRY ME BACK TO OLD VIRGINNY

1. Carry me back to old Virginny,
That's where the cotton and the corn and 'taters grow;
That's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime
That's where this old darkey's heart am longed to go
That's where I labored to hard for old Massa
Day after day in the field of yellow corn
No place on earth do I ove more sincerely
Than old virginny, the place where I was born

Chorus   Carry me back to old Virginny,
That's where the cotton and the corn and 'taters grow;
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime
There's where this old darkey's heart am longed to go.

2. Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live till I wither and decay.
Long by the old Dismal Swamp I have wandered,
That's where this old darkey's life will pass away
Massa and Missis have gone on before me,
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,

Chorus  There's where we'll meet and we'llplace where I was born
