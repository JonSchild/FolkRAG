[*Rumors*]

MEMORANDUM April 23, 1942

To: R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director
From: Eugene Katz, Special Service Division
Subject: Broadcasters Victory Council Circular, dated April 7th

Attached is a marked page of a circular sent out
April 7th by the Broadcasters Victory Council to all member
stations. It advises members that broadcasters should help
to spike rumors and adds that OFF wants to study them. It
says, "If they (rumors) need spiking - and they should be
spiked as quickly and decisively as possible - then you have
a duty to see that denials get on the air fast."

All of us who have given any thought to the rumor
problem agree about one thing - that radio should not be carelessly
used to refute rumors. Unless broadcasters are forcefully
warned against repeating the rumor and then refuting it,
radio will be the means of spreading the rumor instead of 
neutralizing it.

I advise that some word be passed on to either Meservy
or the Bureau of Liaison to advise the Broadcasters Victory
Council to go on record with their members, warning against
the repetition of the original or a paraphrased form of any
rumors over the air.
