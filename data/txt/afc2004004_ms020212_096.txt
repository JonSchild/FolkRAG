Dear Dr. Krone:
The Bessie Jones group, which is beginning to make its
proper impression in the folk song field, still has a
very informal kind of management situation since they
really can't afford yet a proper agent.  During this
period, I am acting as their friend and as their de
facto manager.  At the time the arrangement was made
with you by Mr. Pearl for their services at Idyll-
wild, I had made a firm committment for them at the
Asheville Folk Festival.  The Asheville people are
paying their fare home and a very nice fee, in addition.

I hope that you will understand that this date is a 
much more valuable one for them at this time in their
career and accept all of our apologies for inconven-
iencing you because of their unavailability to you
on the July 5 to 7 weekend.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
