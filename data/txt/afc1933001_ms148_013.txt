You may not know that one of the public services performed 
by the Library of Congress is the printing and distribution of 
catalog cards. These cards are sold at cost to thousands of 
libraries in the country and abroad. In addition many institutions 
and individuals learn of the existence of publications
by consulting one of the seventy-six depository card catalogs 
located in the United States and abroad.

Cards for your publication below which is not in the Library 
of Congress have been requested. If you can supply us with a 
copy as a gift, it would be a very great favor. It would enable
us to furnish the cards and to place your publication upon our
shelves for the many users of the Library of Congress.

We are enclosing a franked label which will bring your publication 
to the Library of Congress post free provided you are able
to comply with our request. If you cannot do so, we should appreciate
a reply to that effect. We will be grateful for such cooperation
as you can give.

Sincerely,

John H. Moriarty
Chief, Accessions Division
