Whatever arrangements you
make an immediate trip
through the deep South is now 
impossible for me until
next autumn. We can take
the mountain trip and come
on to Washington for the
work that needs to be done there
if you can let us hear by July 1.

You never need to apologize
to me for neglect [of] or

you've done your darndest.

See some more of the
good English you claim I
write in the May Atlantic.

Your friend always,
John A. Lomax
