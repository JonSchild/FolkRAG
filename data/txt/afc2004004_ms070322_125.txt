good Communists they hate & love
the place. But it's really pitiful
even compared to Jersey City.
One great black wall, smoke black,
eight stories high but blank,
the facing for blast furnaces,
with great smudged white letters
saying Flame & Forge, Iron
Works --
Then into Solway the industrial
slum, where Engel's mill was,
[wher] the classic seat of Industrial
Capitalism, looking at the mill
where velvet was made by the idiot
crippled children 16 hours a
day, where the people marched &
struck heads & Marx studied
the structure & the future of the
world. Bomb damaged streets of
red houses, crumbling with time
smudged by a 1000 1000
