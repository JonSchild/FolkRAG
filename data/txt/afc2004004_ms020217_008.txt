BJ - R. 2,  p. 7

[*meaning love*]
no doubt the man or the woman is, you know, sick or somethin' or
other, and just can't take care of 'em or ([?]) he should take
care of em because he's the man; he's the head of the house; and by
right he should help and should take care of the chulren.  Well that
way and this ah it's good to have a [hope] holt (hold - married, make you take care of im') to one another, you know? And some
womens will just run into the ground, too.  You know, they'll take -- 
go [over] here with this [here] man tomorrow night and then on yonder [the] next night,
and then come back to you, you know and [any] that kind of way, y' see? [There ain't] if you didn't have no holt;
[no kinda hope], no kind of say-so, that you can go up before the
council -- we call it The Council you know and those they is up -- before the [Lord] law, before the
judge, [or] before the king or the queen or somebody to have the dominions to give orders
for you, [and] but that's the on'y he'p there is, but [they] it just natch'ly
don' make love, y' see? [Just] It natch'ly don' make love. [The psalm] And so the song say
that the Lord done somethin' for me that the law couldn't do. The
Lord give you love; the Lord made you to love, he gives you who to love and whom,
I mean; and what to do, about it, you see...

AL:   What's that [psalm] song?

B.   What and He done so much about it see?

BJ:    The Lord, the Lord have done for me what the law couldn't do?

AL:     I never heard that. How's it go?

BJ:     That's about ah, You heard that. But [you] just can't -- I ain' 'splain it right.
You heard somthin' about , "Lord, Lord, Lord, you done so much..."

AL:    Yeah

BJ:     That's it. "You done what the law could not do." That's the same thing:
[*Song *] 
[*repeated in song texts*]
[*Name*] Lord, Lord, Lord, you done so much for me;
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, you done so much for me;
Lord, Lord, Lord, you done so much for me;
Lord, you have done what the law could not do.
The law cannot save me [*talk*] (it can't save me);
You done so much for me;
Dis law cannot save me;
You done so much for me;
Lord, the law cannot save me;
You done so much for me;
Lord, you have done what this law cannot do.
