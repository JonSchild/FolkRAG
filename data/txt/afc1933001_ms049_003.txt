Mr. John A. Lomax,
1500 Eye St.,
Washington D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

You are cordially invited to attend our fourth annual 'Old Fiddlers' Convention' to be held at the Galax High School Auditorium on October 22 and 23 at 7:30 P.M. each day.

This is not just another 'Old Fiddlers' Convention' but is really an outstanding Folklore festival and last year was attended by registrants and visitors from five or six states. Many Whitetop winners were represented.

Galax, Virginia, situated in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains in both Carroll and Grayson Counties, is an ideal location for such a festival. It is but a short distance from North Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, and has excellent roads and Hotel accomodations.

If you can attend, a card or letter to that effect will be appreciated. If you cannot attend, please give the enclosed poster and letter to some interested person. 

Very sincerely yours,
W.P. Davis
W.P. Davis, M.D.
