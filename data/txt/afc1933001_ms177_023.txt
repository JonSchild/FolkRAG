Mr. Alan Lomax

Division of Music
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

   We are very happy to learn that you like TALL TALES.  By all
means, have Mrs. Lawler see it.  If Archie MacLeish has time, he'd
enjoy it too.  He is an old acquaintance.

   In view of what you say, this is to advise that we will scoop
together $25.00 for you as a fee to:

1.  Do the brief foreword for the film.
2.  Do a note on the relation of the tall tale type of folk song to
   American folk songs.
3.  Do a brief study guide, if possible.
4.  Brief bibliography (records, books, articles, etc.).

   We would like this arrangement to include the filming of you
speaking the foreword, should you be in New York at a time when we can
get the boys to "shoot you."

   Aside from the above, if you can refer to the film on its
merits in any pieces you write (forthcoming Progressive Education article,
for example) it would be appreciated.

   Also I think you could place a paid article in some publication
on Folk Songs in Film (or the neglect of folk songs).  Our experiment
could be pointed to as a wholesome start.  In the non-paid field, Educational
Screen, 64 E. Lake Street, Chicago, would be glad to take an article.

   Lastly, perhaps your office could mail the forthcoming promotional
flier to a relevant portion of your mailing list.  The same type of thing
is being done by U.S.H.A. for the currently released film on housing, A PLACE
TO LIVE.

   We are sending you a news clipping which gives the background of
our production idea.  This data might be useful for articles, etc.

   Is $25.00 acceptable?  When can the print of the film be returned?

Sincerely yours,
[*T. J. Brandon*]
T. J. Brandon
