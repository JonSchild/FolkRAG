Rabbit run - Doodles and 3 friends   Tapaloosa, GA

Man:  …..Ernest brought.....
Man "2":  What did your bring, Ernest?
Ernest:  I brought Billy's old dog …..Horse.....(chatter,
difficult to understand) Everybody brought tally-ho sticks?
(more chatter they let dogs out)
Man:  No, they just running.  They on the rabbit now, they
should be back any minute now.  He's on his way back up here.
He  He should cross this          strip right here, make his way round
here and come back across here.....
AL:  Lots of rabbits in this place?
Man:  Yeah, I got 50 or 75 rabbits in here.
Man:.....here's what happens when you want to show your dogs
off.  They usually mess up somewhere.
Jim:  That's good.... if you could just look at your dogs down there.
AL:  Tell us what the situation is.
Man:  Well, the rabbit's tricked 'em down there, I don't know what
he's done down there.  He's pulled a trick on them.  They should
find him just in a few minutes.  We got one or two good scent dogs
and they should pick him up just any minute.  I don't understand
what happened to them.
Jim:  What do they call this part of the country here?
Man:  This right here is Smithville Community.  We're just north
of Baton, about 4 miles from here down to Baton.  I guess you'd 
call that west George. …….(calls dog.)
