Florida Office 

Rumor


Yesterday this office reported having heard that 400 Jacksonville 
high school girls are pregnant because of relations with
men in the armed forces.

This morning a check was made with principals of the three
high schools here, with emphatic statement by each that so
far as he knows there is not one case in his particular school.

In conversation with the Principal of Jackson High School, he
asked assistance in handling a rumor which had come to him
that some of his high school lads wearing ROTC uniforms have
been stopped downtown by members of the FBI and warned against
impersonating soldiers.

This was taken up with G-2, with advice that so long as the
high school boys wear on their uniforms proper ROTC insignia
they are wholly within their rights.
