Dear Mr. Lomax,

As I wired, I think your last broadcast was particularly 
fine. Giving America her folk-music and its applied
themes, in orchestration, must be tremendously illuminating.  The
popularity of your broadcast is certainly nationwide.  I spoke in
Providence last Thursday, the second guest speaker being a representative 
of the C B S - my neighbor at luncheon.  Though he told the 
women of your program, I think they were all aware of it and could tell
him of it.

To bring in more songs, I have had our local station - which penetrates
N E homes - read a request that songs which your program reminds one of, or
songs differently known in N E, be sent to my address.  This morning it
occured to me that someone who didn't know we were sharing to-gether our
material, would think I was trying to "horn-in" on your hour.  Would you care
to write a line which our local station can read following your broadcast 
saying practically the same thing: that in New England you wish songs
like yours only different, or such as come to mind when your program is
heard, be sent to me - that we are co-workers in New England (or anything
you may care to say indicating what's mine is yours in N E and vice-versa?)
