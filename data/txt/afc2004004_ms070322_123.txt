bought a pair of corduroy trousers
from a solemn Englishwoman who
assured me that Yorkshire corduroys
were the best in the world
& a pair of slacks from a slick
Manchester clerk who assured me
that Man. cottons were the best
in the world & enjoyed long
walks thru the streets holding 
Jean's arm.
Took Joan, Jimmy, Jerry, Jean
& Isla to a Chinese restaurant 
& played papa and they absolutely
meant their attempt to pay me
back. Jerry is a young hero, real
proletarian Jew, face black with
work and hunger for love and
Jean is the same from London
and they don't love each other
because she is always talking 
to Ewan whose face lights
