Dear Sir,
     I thank you very much
for your letter.
     The only time when there is
some singing in the Bar is when
they get rather more than usual
to drink.
I have got in touch with one of
the local boys and he thinks if
he knew what night you were
coming he could arrange with
one or two of the older ones to
come along and give us a song
or two.
We had an old chap 75 in on
