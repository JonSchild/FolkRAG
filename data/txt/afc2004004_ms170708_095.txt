I searched her pockets an' there I found
A silver ring an' five hundred pounds.
I thought the gold looked very nice.  
Said to myself, "This 'll buy a brush."
I was up to the rigs, down to the jigs,
Up to the rigs of London town.

Now sharks an' flats wheresomever you be
Mind you take advice by me,
And treat them well what e'er betide,
But look out an' keep well in Cheapside.
I was up to the rigs, down to the jigs,
Up to the rigs of London town.
That's London for you.

Lomax:  Harry, what's that - the place where you said that the money looked very nice, just enough to buy a - what?

Cox:  I thought the gold looked very nice, Says I, I says, "I'll buy a brush."

Lomax:  Buy a brush?!

Cox:  Brush, you know what brushin' meant, whether it were atween her legs or anywhere else.  I don't know (pause)  That's what I think it meant.

Lomax:  I see.

Cox:  I don't know.
