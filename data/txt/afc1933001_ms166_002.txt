My dear Mr. Lomax:

Mr. W. Cabell Greet of American Speech suggested that I write you with reference to an article on jouk, which he has returned to me for additions before printing.

Jouk was current in Florida at least four years ago, I know, but it may have been in use elsewhere prior to that date. When did you hear it in Florida, or rather Texas? We have reference here, you understand, not to the word cited by Webster's. Of course, jouk in its new weeds is doubtlessly sprung from the same root as the older American word, but it is probably due to a separate development.

Will you please set down for me when and where you first heard the word used. Please indicate (a sentence would be fine) whether used as verb, noun, or adjective. What about jouk-box and those other compounds? Can you throw any light on them?

Please do not go to any trouble in this matter. I doubt that it is worth it.

Very respectfully yours,
Arthur K. Moore
