larly, but there were millions of people who
didn't. He didn't know whose fault it was,
or if it was anyone's fault.
   It was 1898, and Johnson joined the Sixth 
Illinois Volunteers and went to Puerto Rico
to save the little brown brothers. He sa-
more bozos, heard more stories, sang more
songs. He didn't get killed or kill anybody.
He didn't even get poisoned by the bully beef.
And he didn't find out what he went to war
to find out. "Wars," he says, "big wars as
well as little wars, are still a mystery to me."
     He wanted to find things out, and he went 
to college. He worked as the college janitor
for a while. He read some books and raised
some hell. But he didn't find out what he went 
to college to find out, so he quit.
     Johnson struck people, somehow. They 
listened to him. A lot of them thought he
made sense, and maybe he did. But what they
were listening to was the melody of his voice,
low, rich and lonely. It seemed as if he couldn't
say anything common and ordinary without
its sounding like a song. "You're a poet,"
they told him, and Johnson answered, "Maybe
I'm a poet, and maybe I'm a bum."

Fine Stove-Polisher

PEOPLE in Missouri and Iowa listened to his
voice and bought stereopticon views from 
him. People in Kansas and Nebraska listened 
to his voice and hired him to polish their
stoves. One stove for a meal, two stoves for a 
quarter. He polished a mean stove, and if he 
liked his customers as well as they liked him
he told them so and asked them if they had a 
guitar in the house. He'd sit and plunk at it
a while, and then he'd sing the songs the 
galoots sing in Kentucky, in Texas, in Minnesota, 
in Maine. He liked the songs the black
men sang, songs like "Mary, Don't You 
Mourn" and "Let My People Go." Johnson
could sing those songs the way no white man
ever sand them, the way all black men sand
them.
     The troubles of black men and white men
troubled him so that he thought maybe he
was a socialist, and he landed in Milwaukee.
In the daytime he worked for the socialists,
and at night he sat at Pabst's and drank beer
and listened to the free concerts. But he 
didn't find out what he went to Milwaukee
to find out.
     So he went to Chicago and got a job o-
newspaper. Reporters found out things. -
Johnson wasn't a good reporter, he-
