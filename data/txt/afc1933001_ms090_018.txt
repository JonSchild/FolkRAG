Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have just got the final authors' alteration charges on
OUR SINGING COUNTRY which are as follows: The total corrections
were $405.85; 10% allowance was $71.69; we ourselves assumed $283.25,
leaving $55.00 authors' alteration charges for the text, and $50.91
for the music.

In view of your cooperation in accepting a 10% royalty on
the first 4000 copies instead of on the first 2500, as originally
arranged, we started a campaign to have the correction charges
reduced and have succeeded in having the $55.00 charge cancelled
for corrections to the text. This leaves only the charge of $50.91
for the music. Do you want me to send the bill for this direct
to Ruth Seeger? I should rather have it sent to you in the regular
way and have you forward it to her, but I shall be glad to follow
whatever instructions you may give me. I am raising the point
again as she and Alan may well confer and she will then discover
that he is not being charged for the corrections in the text.

Cordially yours,
James Putnam
Assistant to the President

Mr. Putnam has acted very generously,
I think. I'll write to Ruth. If
she can't pay, I'll pay off for her.
[Thes] Macmillans expect cash; if not
paid they'll charge us interest. A few
more than 2000 copies of Our Singing
Country have been shipped from New
York. Probably not all really sold. They
seemed satisfied. I read through the
