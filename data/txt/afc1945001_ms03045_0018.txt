the war effort when the selfish Jewish
people do everything that handicaps 
the cooperation necessary for 
a united effort.  Even if we win

COLUMBUS
"The government should give the 
people more information on the present

men they have there, so why can't 
the government be honest with us." 
From a real estate executive.
