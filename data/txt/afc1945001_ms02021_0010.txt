Miss Katherine C. Blackburn
Chief, Bureau of Public Inquiries
Office of War Information
1400 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D. C.

Dear Miss Blackburn:

Please find enclosed herewith our sixth report from Colorado
for the Bureau of Intelligence in regard to rumors related to the
war effort. In our opinion rumors sometimes start from statements
heard over the radio. For example, when the Washington Merry-Go-Round
makes their predictions people are frequently heard to say, "Well, I
heard on the radio ------", as if it were a fact. We are in agreement
with the leaders of various groups who feel that rumors are either
flying thick and fast or else there are none at all.

Recently less rumors have been heard than was the case a few
months ago. This improvement may be due to the educational program
carried on by various federal agencies as well as the press. Also
because the FBI and other properly authorized federal agencies are
understood to have investigated many wild rumors and people are beginning
to feel that they may become involved in difficulties if they circulate
vicious questionable statements which might be helpful to the enemy.

In accordance with your letter of August 5 please be advised
that our next report on this subject will be forwarded to you at noon,
August 15.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene F. Duffy
Field Representative

Colorado
