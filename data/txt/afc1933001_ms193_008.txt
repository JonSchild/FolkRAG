Dear Harold,

Thanks for your kind letter. It will be 
very pleasant to have a full set of AAFS
records, if, for no other reason, that 
they remind me of the many pleasant
and fantastic things that went to make 
up a folklorist's life... I have played
through the first group of  discs hastily (our 
phonograph is on the blink) and it struck
me that they were not all up to snuff acoustically.
 As for the selection, I am afraid 
that Ben didn't know the material too well.
Still they are the most interesting group of 
records published in America in 1945 and 
should [and will, eventually] be recognized 
as such.

Perhaps you may be interested to know 
something about Special Service, since you
