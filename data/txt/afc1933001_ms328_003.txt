------ Come to the Fair ------

The sun is a-shining to welcome the day,
     Heigh-ho---Come to the fair.
The folk are all singing so merry and gay,
     Heigh-ho----Come to the fair.
All the stalls on the green are as fine as can be00
     With trinkets and tokens so pretty to see,
So its come then, maidens and men 
     To the fair in the pride of the morning ---
So deck yourselves out in your finest array,
     With a Heigh-ho---Come to the fair.

The fiddles are playing the tune that you know;
     Heigh-ho---Come to the fair.
The drums are all beting, away let us go,
     Heigh-ho----Come to the fair.
There'll be racing and chasing from morning tonight,
     And roundabouts turning to left and to right,
So its come then, maidens and men,
     To the fair in the pride of the morning.
So lock up your house, there'll be plenty of fun,
     And its heigh-ho----Come to the fair.

For love making too, if so be you've a mind,
     Heigh-ho---Come to the fair.
For hearts that are happy are loving and kind
     Heigh-ho---Come to the fair.
If "Haste to the Wedding" and fiddles should play,
I warrant you'll dance to the end of the day, ---
So its come then, maidens and men, to the fair in the
     pride of the morning.
The sun is a-shining to welcome the day.
     With a Heigh-ho----Come to the fair.
