Michigan Detroit
Reported by
Four dentists, Henry Ford Hospital

Rumor:  A Ford Hospital doctor tells me that Mr. Charles Fruehauf, Detroit,
went on a yachting trip some weeks ago and every time he put into
port he noticed the same Government boat lying nearby.  After several
such occurrences he pulled his boat alongside one day and asked what
this was all about.  The skipper in charge of the Government boat
said he had orders from Washington to stand by because Washington was
going to take over the Fruehauf boat.  Fruehauf said: "Well, that's
all right with me if that is what they want."  Two days later the boat
was taken over.  The next day Harry Hopkins came aboard and took a
honeymoon cruise with his new wife.  The doctor got this straight from
a Ford official.
