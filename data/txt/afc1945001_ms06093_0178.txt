August 5 - The next came from a young Federal employee engaged in
personnel work, and who handles the work equivalent to that of about three
people, and for this reason, might be inclined to be a bit too critical......
yet it is believed there is some truth in his statements. He said: "There is
entirely too much idleness in many of our own Federal Offices. Some of the Army
personnel, for example, spend half their time just fooling around. I see it,
myself, as my work takes me in and out of many offices during the course of a
few days. The certain Army office I mention is the limit.......some of its
personnel spend half their time deciding who is going out on the street next
for a coke or whose turn it is to go out on the street shopping. They spend
too much time playing around and collecting gadgets for their desks. It's a
shame the way they do, and just because it's the Army, they get away with it.
If you don't believe it, just go to the street floor of a certain building any
time during the afternoon and you will find it crowded with all kinds of the
personnel from upstairs, and they don't have their refreshments and hurry back
to the job, either."  13  Omaha, Nebr.
