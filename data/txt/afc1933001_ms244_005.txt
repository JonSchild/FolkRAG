Dear Father:

My letters must not be getting to you, because I have
certainly tried to keep up a correspondence. I think your
last note was pretty unfair.

I have written Burl Ives a very strong letter, a copy 
of which is enclosed, and I hope to hear from him soon.

The trip has passed its major hurdle, and I think you will
hear from Spivacke in the next few days that the machine is
on its way. Needles to say, I regret the delay horribly.

The enclosed song was left for you by a  very charming,
white-haired pensioner of the Chicago Public School system
who said that they had given her $1700 a year to do what she
wanted to do, and what she wanted to do was write lyrics.
This is one rejected by the Harvard Lampoon!

I saw Bess two days ago in New York, and she is very well
and working enthusiastically on the School of the Air.
I think you can check her off your list of worries.

Enclosed is MacLeish's foreword with a couple of last-
minute corrections by me, red-pencilled by MacLeish, which tell
their own story. I'm awfully sorry I didn't catch this sooner,
but nobody sent me proof, and I didn't think it would be
necessary. Miss Prink tells me the book will be out October 24,
due to delay over priorities.
           
                                                          Much love,
                                                                 Alan
