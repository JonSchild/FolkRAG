got [that] both of them machines.
And then on[e] one occasions (omission) that any sinner could do, because they pose
as Christians and get the confidence of the people, they teach false
doctrines, and then they practice all kind of a sinful things, you know,
in their presence and lead lots of people on. Sure, I had a man here
running me a meeting - his brother was a member or [my] our church - and
he'd come [to] here and preach, and go off that night you know and get him some [sponting?]
women and have a big time, and he got to the place he'n so drunk he couldn't
preach, so he wanted to -- Well, he was a good preacher, you know, [Well] and
he had got the people, you know, was liking fine. And he thought he could
put me out and git the church, and I give him enough money so he
went and paid down on [the] a car & got a car, nd he carried me on to
Fort [West] Worth with him to see my niece over there. And [believing] when we was leaving he had
[the sweet of] persuaded a girl to go with us - didn't know it - and she's at the drugstore [know] down there -
and [he] I picked her up and carried her. And he come back and told the
people that I carried the girl and [went] got her over there and left me [hope] & hear
in the house and [I went me down] didn't know what he'd done and all like a that, you know, and I
went to my niece's house, you know, and he went there with me, the
girl with [him[ me, and [they] we all went in. Well, she made [him something] him welcome, you
know, and she wanted to see me privately and [I] we got talking and I come out,
he had left. And then the girl told me that he said that she wanted
me. And I [guess that's] just thought so strange of him; And then I started then to go and catch
me abus and get on home; but on account of the girl being there & her mama all of our a member
of my church, and hse begged me so [to] tell I just [stuffed down] toughed it out and
come on back with [him] we and he come on back and [brought] put all that stuff [right] out
[here] in my church. I just sent him on away. And, you know, that
same rascal has the gall to come back here and want to preach for me
again. I wouldn't even [but] allow him say his prayers in my church.
