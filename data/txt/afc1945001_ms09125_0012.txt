I am going to do something 
right now replyed Mrs. 
Smith running into 
the house. She calls 
up the war department 
and tells them all she 
has told Mrs Jones. They tell 
her that she has been
lisen to a rumor and that 
is how some of our ships 
are sunk because some
of the rumor is true but
not this one. 
Mrs. Smith was very 
glad to hear that and
told all her friends what 
the war department
people had told her. The
next thing you know 
they have a club called 
"the Stop Rumor" club. 
When every they heard
a romor they would 
never repeat it. That is 
what we all should do.
