an' round an' our hand goes an', inbetwixt that way.  But
that's pretty.
TL:  The whole circle does that, huh?
BJ:  Yeah, the whole circle.  That's beautiful.  Huh!  I'm tellin'
ya.  It's really pretty.  So that's jus' the way they danced the
sets, until they get the set through, an' then they all go to the
table...
TL:  Are there special sets for all different ones, or is this
the same kind of stuff that you do every, single time?
BJ:  You haven't done a set until you've done it through and
through.  Sixteen cen'ers, ya know.
TL:  It's the same thing every single time?
BJ:  The same set.  Every time.  An' every one see who, who can
dance the bes' every time.  An' tha's all.  'Cause sometime you
see the head and feet jine (join), ya see.  The haid an' feet; tha's
mah partner.  If I an' you, if I an' you on the haid, well, we
jine the, the feet.  An' me an, an' I dance to that man
down there an' you dance with that lady, you know, on that,
on that end, ya see.  An' then, then, after we swing, then the whole
corner swing; everybody jus' swing.  All right, then the right
an' lef', they meets.  An' they dance together.  Boy, tha's a
pretty thing!  Um, pretty.
       I know how every bit goes, but I jus' don't never, don't
play it 'cause nobody don't do it now; they jus' get out
there an' go to chunkin' folks ov' their haid.  Hum, slingin'
'em across the floor.  Ha, ha!  They callin' theyself dancing!
An gals, good [God] Lord!, they got to wear double drawers.  Those
boys throw 'em too much.  Ain't this heah some foolish stuff,
though?
