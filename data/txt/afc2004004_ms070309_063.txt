July 11 - [*1942*]
Finally left Bloomington at 6 PM 
after a day of conferences with Thompson,
Boggs, Vorgelin, et al. on folklore
collecting & publishing problems.  - Billfold
lost.  At Paoli stopped by state police
who said, "Your sweetheart is here
with your purse." It was young Dorothy
T. who had driven 80 all the way
telephoning the state police all the
way down the road.  [Censored passage].
Stopped in at a tent rep show where
the family cast was giving a play about
Dec 1-7, 1941 - Japanese spies &
good, honest Americans in their toils in
Honolulu.  Good propaganda by the bucket -
a fine teaching technique for the rural
audience.  'Tween acts two gals sang -
a nonsense song - very funny -
"You can't fool a horse fly."
Beyond Louisville there were no rooms
for a hundred miles - all full of weekending
soldiers & their gals (?).  Had
to go off the road to Lincoln's home town
- Hogdenville, Ky. - & sleep at $3.I5
