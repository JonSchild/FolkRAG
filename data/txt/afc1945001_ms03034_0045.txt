Mr. Knapp its OK.*]

August 1.

Miss Shannon:

Please arrange with FBIS to send to Mr. Robert H. Knapp
daily and weekly reports. Mr. Knapp is now working with us on
rumors and is connected with the Mass. Committee on Public
Safety – Allport's group.

R. K. K.

Mr. Knapp's address is 18 Fremont Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

[*Miss Sherman – I think Mr. Katz wanted to
make this arrangement – I see no reason
why he can't send the letter himself – and notify
Mr. Knapp, please, WS 8/3*]
