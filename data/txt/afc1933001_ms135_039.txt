Mr. Harold Spivacke    July 18, 1938

You might let me know if you or he has any fresh ideas on this
subject, and you can address me either here at the Fair or at the Times
office, where, if you mark it "Personal", it is more likely to reach me
than if it is sent to my home, since I am not there many hours of the day,
and sometimes absent from it for days at a time.

With best wishes, I am

Very sincerely yours,
Olin [Downes]
