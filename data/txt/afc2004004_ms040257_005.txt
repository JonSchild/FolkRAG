CALUM MACLEAN:     I am not sure that Dr. MacDonald has upheld the honour 
of Skye by singing and [I am] you are going away on Wednesday
 morning to Uist. Five Years ago since I went to Uist
and knew no one in Uist.     Today I know too many people
in Uist;    that is why I don't want to go back to Uist 
because  they know too much about me!     However, when
you go to Uist you must bring my greetings to old
Angus MacMillan.        Angus MacMillan was a story-teller
who worked with me for three years.      I thought  I would
kill him    (LONG PAUSE)  before I finished with him
but he was much nearer to killing me before he finished 
with me.      I sometimes recorded stories and started at
four in the afternoon.       By midnight I would be exhausted 
but Angus MacMillan showed no signs of exhaustion.
The longest story he ever told took 9 hours.       We
started on Monday night and took 2 hours.      We had
to break off that night;     continued on Tuesday, two
hours;on Wednesday two hours;    on Thursday two hours
again and we finished the story on Friday night.     It
took us an hour to finish the story.      It took ME
fifteen days to write that story.    It was the longest
story I have ever written and I think it is the longest
story that has ever been recorded in the history of 
folk lore recording.      We have yet to meet someone
who could continue telling a story for nine hours.
If I had sufficient stamina, Angus MacMillan would have
continued the story uninterrupted for nine hours,
but he was a legend in Barra.    He is now 78.   I
was afraid he would die four or five years ago but he
is more lively today than ever.     He is a legend in 
the Island and will be for  a long time.     People  laughed
at him;    they thought his stories were silly but when I 
came [there] and started recording his stories....
