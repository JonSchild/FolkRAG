Bum-backum is a rabbit.
TL: Where did that come from?
BJ: Well, it's just what I learned from, ah, my grandfather
learnt me that. See? "Met Bum-backum," that was the rabbit. And
then he called "Tum-tackum," that's the dawg, see? See, because
he's a, he, he sure can tack 'em. An' he'll tack 'em sure as you're
born.  An', "to make Bum-backum leave the whirley-wheely-whack-em,"
see?  An' [it's just as] that's as easy as, I say it's just as easy as spittin'.
Like I was jus' tellin' it off, ya see?
TL:  I've never heard those words for those things.
BJ:  [N-o] I know.  Well, I have. . .

     An' here's another lil' sho't one here.  Now, this [these] is easy.
I know ya know this one here, because it's common.  Ah, hit's, hit's
between the. . ."Ah, it's between the heaven an' the earth.  An' it's
