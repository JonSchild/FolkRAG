If I should Die Tonight

Back in 1904 I taught English to husky, happy young
Freshmen in the A.& M. College at College Station Texas.  Saturdays
and Sundays I spent on the pig plantations across the Brazos
river southwest of Bryan looking for Negro folk songs  It 
was here I first heard "De Ballit ob de Boll Weevil," now
become famous and destined to outlive the "little Bug" that 
first inspired its Negro composers.  The tune I first heard sung by a blind Negro
guitar [?] as he sat by his tin cup on a
street corner in Hearne Texas. Hearne is only
a few stations north of Hempstead, sometimes called six
shorter junctions "[?] Hempstead (the next station), and Hell,"
as brakemen used to shout. The song has since travelled
with the boll weevil, growing in length as the boll
weevil made his way slowly clear across the country from the Rio Grand river to the Atlantic Ocean.
Back in 1904 its ravages were very destructive to the cotton fields of South Texas
where the song had its beginning.  The Negroes' sang:

O, hav you heard de lates',
De lates' ob de songs?
Its about dem little boll weevils
Picked up bof feet an' gone,
A-lookin' for a home,
Jes' a-lookin' fur a home.

De boll weevil is a little bug
Fum Mexico dey say,
He come to try dis Texas soil
An' he thought he'd better stay,
A-lookin' fur a home,
Des a-lookin' fur a home.

There are many stanzas and much Negro humor in the entire
song to be found in American Ballads and Folk Songs.

One Saturday morning a cold wet norther was blowing and
I couldn't get down to the river bottoms, so I telephoned to my
friend, Tom Connally*, at Marlin to come down and spend the
week-end with me.

Some years before, I had down Tom well at the University
of Texas where his genuine friendliness and attractive
