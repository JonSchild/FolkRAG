AL:  You said you'd written several papers and something 
had happened to them.

Raymond:  Yes, well, they were. . . . I don't think it's a good 
idea to do this type of research and not write it down, and 
put the blame on somebody else in later years to try and 
do it-- every little bit that you can contribute I think 
should be done.   And these papers were written for my 
won amusement- and amazement- and the Library of Congress 
saw them and asked if I might give them a copy, so I did.  
And they told me later that someone did me the ultimate 
compliment, and stole both ofthem, so I had to replace them.  
But I havent sent them the last one- I just finished one 
on pitching- the role of the pitcher in Sacred Harp.

AL:  This is a part time activity. . .what has been your 
professional. . .

Raymond:  Jeweler, I'm a jeweler.

AL:  That's been your life's work?

Raymond:  Oh, yes, 46 years of it.

AL:  Don't composing and jewelry work. . sort of similar in 
a sense. . . ?

Raymond:  Well, the early composers all composed and wrote 
music as a hobby.  They had other jobs to make a living. 
It's a great relaxation to me.  The jewelry business, and 
I'm a professional watchmaker, too, and this type of work
