Mr. John A. Lomax
Seguin, Texas

Dear Sir:

I have your letter of September 10, with regard to
contacting some group of our singers in Texas and
Louisiana.

I am very sorry that I do not know of any such group in
Louisiana, but refer you to Mr. R. J. Behannon,
Lufkin, Texas, who heads a large organization of
this type in Texas. I feel sure he will be able
to furnish you such information as you desire.

Sincerely yours,
W. H. (Uncle Bill) Hardman
