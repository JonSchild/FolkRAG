Dear Mr. Lomax:
I received your letter forwarded by Arthur Kyle Davis,
Jr., and your note the following day, also.
I note that you found my letter of permission for use
of the two sea shanties, Santy Anno, and Haul Away, My Rosie; however
you are rather mixed as to acknowledgements! I should be glad, of
course, for you to mention my Folk Hymns of America (J. Fischer & Bro.),
if you are including Bibliography, or have occasion to mention it; but
those two sea shanties naturally would not be given in a book of folk
hymns!
Please give footnote at bottom of page, as in your last
book, for each, like this:
*Recorded by Annabel Morris Buchanan, Richmond, Virginia. Published for 
mixed chorus, J. Fischer & Bro., N.Y.C.
If you are using your own recording, then please state
*Previously recorded by AMB, etc. (as just given)
And for Haul Away My Rosie, add this, in appendix if preferred:
Also quoted in Modal and Melodic Structure of Anglo-American Folk Music: Introducing 
a Neutral Mode. Annabel Morris Buchanan. (Address before International
Music Congress, Sept. 13, 1939. Published by G. Schirmer, for American Musicological 
Society.) Also quoted in Mrs. Buchanan's A Neutral Mode in Anglo-American 
Folk Music, Southern Folklore, June, 1940 (Vol. IV, No. 2).
I am not sure of the date of Southern Folklore, but have just corrected 
proofs of my article, and it will be out in a few days. It seems rather
awkward to quote so much in acknowledgements, but I don't know how else to give
credit to those three publishers - J. Fischer & Bro., G. Schirmer, and Southern
Folklore. So much red tape!
Please let me know if this is O.K. I'm also using both tunes in
two books, but they are not yet published.
Sincerely and cordially,
Annabel Morris Buchanan
