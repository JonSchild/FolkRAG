Smith, Dorothea

It was said that down in Texas 
the boys in the Army Camps are 
getting horse meat sheep meat 
and here we are making sacrifices 
of [buttler] butter, meat etc;  so 
they can have it.  The meaning 
for this is they are sending 
this rationed food across 
to the whales and other 
fish (you might as [weell] well say 
because the soldiers in Australia 
and Africa never get it)  I bet 
the ocean is full of fat fish.
