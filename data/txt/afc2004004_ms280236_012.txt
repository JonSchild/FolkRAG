3) I sent a servant to her house,
   To the house where she was dwelling,
   "My master wants you, miss, "he said,
   "If your name be Barbrie Allen."
4) How slowly she put on her clothes,
    How slowly she came to him,
    And the words she said when she got there,
    "Young man, you are a dying."
5) "A-dying love, that never can be
    When a kiss from you will save me."
    "A kiss from me you never shall have
    For I say, young man you'll slight me."
6) While in the ale-house the other night
    You were out a-drinking,
    You drank your health to all pretty girls,
    And slighted Barbrie Allen.
7) Look up, look up by my bedside,
    You'll see a gold watch hanging,
    A gold watch and a silvery chain,
    Was bought for Barbrie Allen.
8) Look down, look down by my bedside,
    You'll see a basin standing,
    A basin standing full of blood,
    Was shed for Barbrie Allen.
9) He turned his face unto the wall,
    I'll do to one, I'll do to all,
    He bid adieu to all his friends,
    And slighted Barbrie Allen.
10) Go mother, mother, make my bed,
    Go make it long and narrow,
    For that young man has died today
    And I will die in sorrow. 
11) Go father, father, dig my grave,
    Dig it both long and narrow,
    For that young man has died today,
    And I will die tomorrow.
12) So in the churchyard they did lay
    They laid them both together,
    What a happy couple they might have been
    If they had loved each other.
That's a good song...
Lomax: That's a magnificebt song!
