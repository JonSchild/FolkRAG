London, Feb 18th

For six pence Robin and I secured the buy
from a shoemaker across the way and
pushed open the heavy iron gate and
walked in under the arch.  Somewhere while
we were climbing the narrow stairs or standing
over the [?] of the great hall,
or pushing out through an [?] of
the tower, I felt the sharp pain of
not being loved flow in and take
possession of my heart.  And [?] the
sweet landscape became black & white
And I put on my ankles & my wrists
the old, bloody gyves which I have
dragged now through all Ireland
& back to London again.  Robin is 
sick with back, [?], head & i am
sick with lack of love & but being
together has turned torment for me
and I dream every night of anal intercourse
or girls with cunt faces or some-
one else.  And Robin never wants me or
thinks of me & so we're going to part soon.
