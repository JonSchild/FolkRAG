Dear John:

At last the Archive is able to
begin to plan the publication of some of
our best records. In the next few weeks
I hope to be writing a whole group of
folk musicians for permission to use
their performances in these non-profit
pressings, and I find I lack Son Terry's
address. Can you give it to me? I want
to ask him about the use of his Lost John
and The Fox Chase, which you helped me to re-
cord some years back. 

When are you going to visit me in the
Archive and hear a few dozen of our really thrilling ne
new acquisitions?

Best regards from Elizabeth and myself,

Alan
