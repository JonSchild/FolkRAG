Dear Alan
I wrote to Hugh MacDiarmid asking him to persuade J. Lorne-Campbell 
to assist you in your search for Gaelic folk singers in Scotland. 
I enclose his reply. If you do manage to get to Scotland, I am sure 
you will find him most helpfull. I have also written to Hamish Henderson
who has an extensive collection of soldiers songs - he will probably 
communicate with you directly. 

I understood you were coming to Manchester on Sunday or 
Saturday, - but I expect I misunderstood you. I'm sorry for I should 
have enjoyed meeting you again. I leave for Bergen on Saturday and 
won't be back in England until March 25. If you are still in London 
perhaps we could meet. 

Best wishes for Robin and yourself, 
Jimmy Miller.
