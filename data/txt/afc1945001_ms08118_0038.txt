Rumor 

It is being said that the draft 
boards, since January have drafted 
about 700,000 men between the 
ages of eighteen and nineteen 
and in Washington they are saying 
that the more men in 
uniform when the war is over 
the more difficult the problem of 
disbanding troops will be.  Mr. 
Hoover's suggestion was to furlough 
large numbers of [troops] soldiers 
for the harvest & its being said 
that the government may adopt his 
suggestions.
