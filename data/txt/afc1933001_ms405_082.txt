   By 1933 impressive advances had been made in sound 
recording.  The big record companies sent trucks through the 
South, equipped with a sound proof room and electrically driven 
sound recording apparatus costing a total of as much as 
$50,000.00.  These companies were looking for singers of the old 
ballads and folk songs.  Advertising in advance in cities, they 
invited singers to come in for voice or other musical tests. 
This method of song collecting has been abandoned.  The principal
sound recording laboratories are now in New York City.  Singers are
invited to come there.  The present wide use of the radio uncovers
much of the talent.
   
    The problem of the small equipment, not too heavy for 
transporting in an automobile, seems to have presented greater 
difficulties.  Improvements have come slowly.  I remember well the first electrically driven 
machine that I operated in 193[4]3.  The amplifier weighed more than 
100 pounds; the turn table case weighed another 100; two Edison batteries weighed 75 pounds each.  The 
microphone cable, the tools, etc., accounted for sufficient weight 
to make the total 500 pounds.  The different cases were bulky, unwieldy 
and hard to handle.  In order to carry them in my car I tore out the back 
seat and placed in a specially built-in wooden framework.  [of leather.]  
The two big batteries were dangerous 
for once the car overturned and my son got acid burns
and lost a suit of clothes.
   
    The present equipment furnished
me by the Library of Congress weighs 
less than half as much as the first 
unsatisfactory machine.  It is driven 
by [an] one six cell battery.  
When [it] the battery runs down or in any other emergency, [an outer 
mobile] a battery [will do the job] out of your automobile
will do the job.
