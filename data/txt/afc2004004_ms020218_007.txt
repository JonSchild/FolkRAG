[*SNAKE AT BREAST 13*]

[*snake milking*]
BJ: Well, up in my -- that's been years ago, over forty-five
years ago now -- I was weanin' my chile; I had a lot of milk.
I was jus' startin' to water...the milk just steeped, you know, out.
An' so, I was weanin' her an' this milk, I had to milk it off, you
know. 'Cause I had so much milk. An' this ol' house [ov' there], see,
[it] was ol' log house, old timey long house, an' it had a big ol'
[re] fireplace to it; log, stick and dirt chimney; that was [up there] in
near Fitzgerald. An', ah, so, they said they was a lot of snakes
around there, you know, black snakes, you know, an' I had [to receive] we'd
? some of 'em, a big killer [some] ??) sometime. But this night I
was layin' there in the bed, an' I know I had my gown on backwards.
An' I was layin' on my right side -- No, I was layin' on my lef' 
side. An' I know my gown was on backwards, an' I had put [rose] Rosalie
[leaves on] my daughter -- put ['em] her in the back of me, put ['em] her with a 
[the] pillow, you know, where she wouldn't fall. An' I felt my
bres' a-just drawin', jus' drawin', an' I felt [that] it, an' [I was] in a 
[jus'] half slumber[in'], you know? An' I know that she was on the 
back of me, [you know] I wanted to know. I put my hand there to feel her. An' that
time the thing, it lep (lept), you know, it drawed up hard and 
lep'. That time that Cassius [????] jumped up out of the bed; he 
jumped quick, an' when he jumped he hit the flo'. An' I, an' I
didn' know what it was. I said, "Wha's the matter; wha's the
matter; wha's the matter?" He said, "Nuttin'" Said, "Nuttin'."
An' he done caught that snake; he felt the foot, felt [that] it around
his foot, y'know, the tail of it. See, he was [crawlin' on the] quirlin' his tail,
mus' have been crawlin on the...had one of those roll foot beds,
ya know. He mus' a-been puttin' his tail over that bed or sumpin'.
Any how, Cassius felt it, with his feet. An' Cassius grabbed it;
he not scared of snakes; he grabbed that snake, an' that was his
[then] snake. They come out the bed together. He done it [right] ? there,
an' throwed his tongue out his mouth, an' you could see the
[speurum] ? of -- [that] milk was in [there flowin'] that floor.  Now thas' the holy
truth. An' I like to fainted. Heh, an' I looked, I said, "What's
the matter?" He said, "Nothin', nothin'." [*repeat snake*] An' I lit the lamp 
then, 'cause I knew sumpin' was pullin', jus' pullin; it felt
like, funny. An' I know she was on dis side of me. An' I went
to see how she got ov' this way; how she get this way? I moved
my hand that way, then he move, you see? After I was movin'
