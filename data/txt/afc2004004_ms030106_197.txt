1917 I came back to Chicago from a trip on the road.  I had been
foolin around, doin a lotta pool playing just before Pensacola Kid
left for South America - went to Buesos Aires, Argentina Republic.  I
even remember his address very well - 747 Huckerman St. Hotel Sala, B.A.
Aregentina, S.A.  He went down there in order to try to beat all the
pool players, which was no  trouble because he had beat everything there
was in America.  He was a very shrewd pool player - had beat everybody-
but in the year of 1917 he still didn't have any money.  I was quite
prosperous - that was the year that Blankinship was the champion pool player
of America.  Blankinship came on the South Side of Chicago and wanted to

Paul thought he could beat him - Pensicola Kid.  So him and I had been
friends for years and he said, "I can beat this guy."  I said, "He's
champion of the world, you know.  He has to be good to be champion.  I
know you're good."  (Course I was good, too.)  Finally, he wanted to play
for 200 - I had the money but I told him 50 was enough.  When I let
him have the $50, he played him.
     Blankinship was almost out - P. kid needed 18 balls and he left
him very, very hard against the cushion and he was right in the center
of the table and they was playing line-up pool - he was lined up
exactly with the front ball - it was counted very hard for him to
make a shot - so he made the last ball on the table.  They were playing
what they call the "cushion king (?) and he made that ball.
     By that time I was getting ready, thinking about leaving Chicago.
I didn't like Chicago so much - they had an influx of a different class
of people that was invading Chicago at the time.  So just about time, after
being there a couple of months or a little more, "very prominent figure
around Chicago by the name of Lovely Joe - Joe Woodson - he came to me
and told me they had a job in Los Angeles - that they particular wanted
me if they could get me.  I didn't even stop and ask em for salary because
