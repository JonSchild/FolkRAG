    He's gone to de house for to ring de bell,
        Oh, Hannah, go down;
    He's gone to de house for to ring de bell,
        Oh, Hannah, go down!

    Bullies, did you hear whut de Captain said?

   Bullies, did you hear whut de Captain said?
        Oh, Hannah, go down!

    Bullies, if you'll work I'm goin' trust you well,
        Oh, Hannah, go down;
    And if you don't I'm goin' give you hell,
        Oh, Hannah, go down!

    Go down, Old Hannah, don't you rise no mo',
        Oh, Hannah go down;
    If you rise any mo' bring Judgement Day!
        Oh, Hannah go down.

    It is a far cry from Iron Head back in a Texas penitentary
to the time of one of the standard English ballads. Iron Head's
version has never been printed as popularly sung down the centuries, 
but the tune and the story in every important detail fol-
lows the tale as it was sung withing castle walls when men rode
to war clad in armour with their lady's favor fluttering from
lances. Here is what Iron Head sang to me:

            Once I knowed old lady,
            Round Tennessee she dwell;
            She had a lovin' husband
            But she loved other young men's as well

                   Love my darlin', oh!
                 I Love my darlin', oh!
