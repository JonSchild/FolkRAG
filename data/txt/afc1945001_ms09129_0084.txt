When the Yorktown (aircraft carrier) was
sinking there was only one steak and five
gallons of ice cream. Their last thought of action
before evacuating the ship was to auction
off the steak and fill their helmets with 
ice cream.

A traveling salesman traveling through
the hills of Kentucky stopped at a filling station
to get some gas. He asked the attendant for
five gallons of gas. While the attendant was
filling the tank, the salesman asked him
what he thought of the war. The attendant
replied "what war?" Upon seeing this the
salesman said, "Forget the gas and five
me four tires."
