I am about to travel at Library
expense about 750 miles to talk 
to and record this man's songs, stories
and "hollers". Send me by air mail 
your reaction to this plan. I can't
go to Oklahoma or to Woody's 
[Pampa?] in this zero [weather?] When 
I do travel again I'll go by [????]
cars -- and done -- for obvious
reason.  Write at once and 
then [??] in more detail in 
reply to my other letter.

Lovingly, 
Father
