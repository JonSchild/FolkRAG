THINGS MEN WON'T TOUCH

These men are queer, you must admit,
A wife, at least, can swear to it.
There never was a man so good
He wasn't queer about his food.
A woman has to watch with care
When fixing up her bill-of-fare.
Because there always is so much
He doesn't like and wouldn't touch.

One man may long for lemon pie,
That makes anoher nearly die;
And I've heard screams from great big men
Because their wives had prunes again.
Some want their gravies good and thick,
And that makes other husbands sick.
I never dare make such and such
Because that's one thing he wouldn't touch.

I wouldn't mind it, though at that,
But here's what I go crazy at;
We're having dinner at the Green's;
Our hostess serves us butter-beans.
He really eats more beans that wise
And lauds her cooking to the skies.
That isn't what I mind so much
But beans are things he wouldn't touch.

He says, "By gosh, these beans are great,
Why haven't we had some of late?"
I say, "You never like them, dear."
He says, "Not fixed like these ones here?"
And the I get a dirty look
That says, "Poor man--she just can't cook."
Yes, when you're out, it beats the Dutch
The way men eat what they wouldn't touch.

THE PEOPLE PEOPLE MARRY

The people people own by birth
Are often very queer
The people people choose as friends
Quite shock your first idea,
The people people work with best
Your common sense appall,
But the people people marry---
They're the queerest ones of all.
