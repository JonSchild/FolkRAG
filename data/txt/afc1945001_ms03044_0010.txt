RUMOR REPORT

            We are enclosing a collection of rumors secured by the 
various persons listed as suggestions for cooperation in this report.
            The manager of a neighborhood drug store, the local 
Chamber of Commerce secretary and the local sheriff stated that they 
had heard no rumors during this period and the other people contacted 
said that there were very few, if any, rumors being circulated at 
present.  They attribute this to the fact that everyone is so busy 
taking advantage of the good weather and working on the farms that 
there is very little , if any, activity around the cities.
            The descriptions of the people collecting the rumors during 
this period are as follows:
            The dentist has his office located in the central business 
location of the city and his practice is general and no particular 
racial group predominates, but if one did, it would be the German 
group.
            The policeman covers the entire city as is the custom in small 
communities in agricultural states, no well defined beat being assigned 
due to size of the city.
            The beauty parlor operator is located in the central part of 
the city and has a very good trade which is general with no particular 
racial group predominating.
            This also supplies to the manager of the drug store we contacted 
and the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce.
