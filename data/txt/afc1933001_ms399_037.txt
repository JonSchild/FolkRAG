a more accurate account of the origin of the word "dogie".

While the cowboys were constantly punching along the dragging dogies,
what more natural than that they whould sing to them and, finally, about them? One
of the songs thus inspired was "Git Along Little Dogies". Its plaintive tune suggests
a dreary, rainy day, the herd drifting slowly on northward, many weary miles
behind and many weary miles ahead. The song has notes that remind you of the desert
cry of a yellow-breasted field lark piping its cries on a lonely mesquite shrub, or
the faint far away fail of a coyote summoning his pack to the top of the hill. Such
a song was popular for the line-rider, whose only companion for months was his horse.
He, strangely enough, found comfort and solace for his loneliness by singing sadly
reflective songs like "Git Along, Little Dogies".

The widespread popularity of this song in early cattle days has recently
been justified in the good fortune of a New York City song writer, who, using this
refrain in "The Last Round-up" won both fame and fortune. Of all radio songs it for
many months, was most popular.

The cowboy "Little Dogie" song centers around a trail herd on the way north
where the steers will be made into "soup for Uncle Sam's Indians". Many of the herds were delivered direct to Indian reservations. But the cattle are supposed to be comforted 
by the often repeated assertion of the song,

"It's your misfortune and none of my own."
