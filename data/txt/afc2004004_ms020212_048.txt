Dear John:

Thanks for your good letter. I'm glad you're home safe and
had a good time with us in New York. We certainly enjoyed
you in spite of the fact that we were very busy.

I want to give you a couple of very strong words of advice
from your manager: (1) you are going to have more and more
time on your hands as you travel around, and less and less
exercise in the good hot sun. This is going to mean that your
body will not be able to absorb so easily the amount of alcohol
that it has in the past. Eventually it will make you sick
and fuzzy-headed. I have watched lots of performers fall because
of this problem, for the same reasons. That is why
I tell you that you and Henry and Peter are going to have to
watch your drinking these next few years. To put it another
way, you're going to have to figure out other things to do
with your spare time.

(2) The other thing is that the group needs practice in order
to quickly achieve the success we have spoken of. You should
meet at least three nights a week for three or four hours.
Do not try to practice in the juke joints at Peter's end of
the Island. It is too noisy. You need a quiet atmosphere.
I suggest you get together at some house, maybe Emma's mother's
place, which she says is available, where you will not be
interrupted.

(3) I am very worried that you all are not able to resume
your old employment. It is not certain yet that you are
going to make your livings as entertainers or how long you will
last when you do. Make every effort to get a job that you can
go back to when things get tough, and make sure that everybody
in the group does the same thing. I am sure that, when
you tell your employers how much attention you are bringing
to the Sea Islands, they will support you in this and try to 
help you.

I will be writing you later, but for now give my regards to
all the group and remember me,

Your friend,

Alan Lomax
