COMPANY "C" VICTORY SONG

We will hang the old Mikado to a cherry blossom tree,
We will hang the old Mikado to a cherry blossom tree,
We will hang the old Mikado to a cherry blossom tree,
As we go marching on.

Glory glory we are raiders, glory glory we are raiders.
Glory glory we are raiders, and we'll go marching on.

We will take the rising sun and we will set it in the west
We will take the rising sun and we will set it in the west
We will take the rising sun and we will set it in the west
As we go marching on.

CHORUS OVER AGAIN

We will take the little corporal for a one way ride,
We will take the little corporal for a one way ride,
We will take the little corporal for a one way ride,
As we go marching on.

CHORUS OVER AGAIN

We will bury Mussolini in a big brick tomb,
We will bury Mussolini in a big brick tomb,
We will bury Mussolini in a big brick tomb,
As we'll go marching on.
