Roll 53 Stan Hicks' house 5

Stan: That's because he was a preacher...

Hat: That was my mother's dad.

Stan: And she mentioned about a preacher, I want to tell you a story about
one. Back in the old days they had little log houses, where they preached
at. And he went home with this feller for supper,...and, so, lots of bears
at that time, a few bears in the woods. Had a trail trimmed down around...
for the old horses and buggies and stuff that'd go, and then they'd have 
this little old path thru the woods where you could walk thru it at. And
he says "Now don't go thru there, the bears..." and he said "Oh, no, the
Lord'll take care of that." He said, "No don't go, the bears, please don't"
and so (unint.) went on around the road. Now he went on to church, and it
was a long time, and they got to worrying about the preacher. And finally
he come, just as hard as he could come, his clothes tore all to pieces,
blood runnin' out of him and all. He run jumped up and (unint) and he
said "Now, folks, I've been preachin' to you, that the Lord protect you,
to save you, took care of you sa long as you done His will. But I've 
changed my mind just a little bit. He ain't worth a damn in a bear fight!"
(laughter)

AL: Well, this is one of the recurrent themes of southern mountain life.
These people were non-conformists, they came into the mountains to live the
life they wanted to live, and to believe in the Lord, and practice a religion
the way they wanted to practice it. And so they established a whole
new way of looking at things here. And they are still really independent
about their religious beliefs to day, aren't they?

Stan: Yeah, they feel independent about it now. We Primitive Baptists, they
call us "hard shells". You know, they don't go along with you, and there's
a lot of denominations, but they're not all right, somebody has to be wrong,
