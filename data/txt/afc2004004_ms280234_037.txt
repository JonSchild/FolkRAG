did die in bad health. She got double pneumonia three times and
she went away to hospital. I couldn't tell you the disease that she
had for they never told me. Well then, when she dies, she called
me to the bed where she was dying, and all the friends was right
around. And you see, I hadn't a bit of sense. She called me over
and she said, "Margaret, my Margaret". And from that I walked away.
But I was going down the stairs and I said, "Me mother is dying.
Me mother is dying." I was taking more fun out of it than serious.
You know that? I was taking more fun out of it, you know. I had
no understanding of it. I was running down the stairs, me mother
is dying, my mother is dying." 'Course, I said, "Me mammy", like.
"Me mammy." "Me mammy is dying, me mammy is dying." She said, "Who
said that?" She called me over and then she put her hand like that,
she says, "Margaret, my Margaret." When they were putting her in
the coffin, in the coffin, you know, one of the old women lifted me
up and made my kiss her. Do you see, the thing is I hadn't no
sense, see. Like I had no sense, and I didn't mind very much. I
kissed her as she was dying. That's all I remember. Is she coming
back to my heart? I cried every day. I cried for days and days.
When she was drew up, that finished me. I always had her there, in
my heart. When she was drew up, if anyone might bring up her name,
that would finish me. But she was the finest woman that ever lived
in the city of Cork. And another  thing about her, she was a
producer. All the nice plays, collections, house to house collections.
She'd go along from one neighbour to another; she'd gather up, you
see. Well such a one gave threepence or fourpence or sixpence or
whatever you could afford. And they were all coming up to the
Christmas time - all this money woud be in a box collected up
for the purpose; and then they'd all start to get rehearsals, and
singing, and going over these things. I don't barely remember this,
you know - barely remember. . . . . . .
