Dr. Homer Rainey
President, University of Texas
Austin, Texas

Dear Dr. Rainey:
   A short while ago I sent you a letter about a project
I felt would be of great interest to the University
of Texas. The carbon of this letter is attached, since
I suppose the original must have been mislaid.
   In the meantime further discussion with Dr. Goodchild 
has resulted in a decision on the approximate
budget a copy of which is attached. We have further
agreed to request Archibald MacLeish, Librarian of
Congress to apply to the Carnegie Foundation for funds
sufficient to finance this project for a year.
   An expression of interest from you and Dr. Dobie 
would, I am sure, greatly strengthen this application.
Since I am about to present the whole matter to the 
Librarian, I would very much like to know what you think
of it. Your suggestions for a sponsor in Pennsylvania
would also be extremely helpful. May I expect to hear
from you soon.

Sincerely yours,
