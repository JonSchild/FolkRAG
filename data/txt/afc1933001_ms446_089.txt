The angels came and took her, 
The angels God had sent ; 
They bore her into heaven,
She whispered as they went--

The father was no Christian,
His sins were unforgiven, 
He could not as she asked him, 
Rejoin her up in heaven. 

He gave his heart to Jesus, 
He took its stain away ; 
And now in God believing,
The father, too, can say-- 

Its voice is still appealing
O, meet me over there ! 
To us it was a summons
For heaven to prepare. 

Soon we shall pass the Jordan, 
Soon we shall fade away ; 
In our departing moments 
May we exultant say-- 

No. 74 

Away from his home and the friend of his youth
He hastened the herald of mercy and truth, 
For the love of the Lord and to seek for the lost, 
Soon, alas !  was his fall, for he died at his post. 

Strangers wept that in life's bright bloom,
One gifted so highly should sink to the tomb. 
For in order he led in the van of his host, 
He fell like a soldier, he died at his post. 
He wept no himself that his warfare was done, 
A battle was fought, the victory won. 
But he whispered to those that his heart clung to
most, 
Tell my brethren for me that I died at my post.
