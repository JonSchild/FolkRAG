Ogden, Utah 

August 12:  I have a friend who has a farm nearby and he 
told me that he had five acres of potatoes that would never be dug 
because it was impossible for him to get help.  He stated that it 
seemed the Government would draft men or help to take care of the 
crops that are going to waste on the farms, even if it would be for 
no other reason than to help feed the enlisted men in the army.  [*203*] 

August 12:  To see people pleasure riding on Sunday afternoons 
and evenings you would never know there is a shortage of rubber.  It 
is hard for the people to realize that this is a fact.  [*Ogden, Utah*]  [*203*] 


Salt Lake City, Utah 

August 11:  Why doesn't England give India what it asks for.  
If she expects to retain complete control through force over these 
people, she can't very well expect the citizens of India to help her 
in the war effort.  [*2*]  [*203*] 

August 14:  I heard that the war will be over by November 1.  
Why all this fuss about blackouts and air raid warnings in Ogden?  
We won't be bombed.  [*Ogden, Utah*]  [*203*] 

August 13:  If we are fighting to preserve democracy, England 
ought to handle the India situation more tactfully.  It is pretty 
hard for me to understand England's attitude.  She wants us to help 
save her -- but on the other hand she is trying to retain her 
imperialism in India.  [*2*]  [*203*]  [*Ogden, Utah*]
