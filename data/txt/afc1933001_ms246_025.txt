Recently he and his band have made an
album for Decca, entitled Tom Benton's 
Saturday Night.  He asked me to tell 
you that years ago Columbia issued 
a record "Pretty Polly" on one side and 
"Dannielle Girl" on the other that, according
to his way of thinking,
were the ne plus ultra in 
mountain ballad singing.  One
Dock Boggs, now passed on, 
sang the songs. 
Benton knows Charley Sawyer
well and Charley Sawyer has
told him of the "Archive." I suggest, 
on the basis of this information, 
that you establish your
own contact with Tom Benton 
Write him a cordial letter (he
says he is coming to see you 
soon), thank  him for his offer
of help, send him a catalogue, etc.
