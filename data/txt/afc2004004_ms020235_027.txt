"WILLIAMSBORO," AND IT USUALLY COMES OUT "WAYNESBORO."  THIS
TIME, HOWEVER, SHE IS SPECIFIC.

BJ:  Um-hum.
TL:  I thought you were talking about Williamsboro.
BJ:  Huh-uh.  Waynesboro.  That was -- He learn how to plow.  I
ain't never learned; I ain't never wanna learn.  He learned; he
had never plowed.  See, he, he's ah, he's ah, goin' into 30 year
old then.  An' never plowed a lick.  An' never, an' never. . .
TL:  How old were you then, Bessie?
BJ:  I was, ah, 24.  Twenty-fo'.  Yeah, 24, 25, 26, 'cause that's
in '24.
TL:  Well, did you leave him or did you just. . .?
BJ:  I lef', I left [when I said I did] myse'f ya know.  When I got ready. . .I tell
ya I just left.  'Cause I didn', wouldn' worry about no man. . .
