Dear Miss Smith:

I am sorry I can tell you very little about your two interesting songs. The second seems to be of individual authorship, and if Teddy Blue says he wrote it, I would tend to credit him with his habitual truthfulness in this instance. I think I have seen a fragment of No. 1 somewhere, but I feel fairly certain that there is no music available for it. I'll write J. A. and perhaps he will recall it.

There is another source of information to which you might turn. I understand that a student of Dr. George Herzog's at Columbia has been working on a classificaton of cowboy songs. Perhaps she may have heard of this piece.

To make certain that my feeling about No. 2 wasn't an individual opinion, I consulted B. A. Botkin and found that he agreed with me.

I feel that if you plan to print the songs, you should take down Teddy Blue's music for them, if possible one a recording machine, since his airs, even if these are traditional songs, probably are different from the next cowboy's airs.

I appreciate your sending me a full text of "Concerning Larry Wolverton"; it's a vigorous piece. If you ever find a complete text for the River Song, I would be delighted to have it for the Library files.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
