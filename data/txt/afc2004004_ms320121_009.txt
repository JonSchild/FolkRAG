Tape: 1356 cont.    Mrs. McGee      3

somebody else would take his violin and play his violin in his
place.   He'd catch him a girlfriend and dance. . . .right in
front of my eyes, so I decided I would stay home. . .that's
the truth, I swear to God, that's the real truth. . . . . . . . . . . .
Yeah, my daddy, when I got married without his permission,
and when I wanted to go back, had to apologize, and he wouldn't
let me in.  Three months later after I got married, I went
with my sister one Sunday morning, and I said, Dad, I want
to apologize for what I did.   I know it wasn't right. . He
said, well, I don't know if I should apologize.  Asked
forgiveness, and my mother said, yes, you have to forgive.
So he said, yes, I will forgive both of you so come on in
the house.   So we walked inthe house and we were free.  That
was three months we were married. . . . .
Dennis:     We went to Texas. . . .we sold our place on Kent Street
and we went over there and we lost everything except 1200
dollars. . .we come back and bought  this place here.
Mrs. MCG:     Back in [$5000] Rose Texas. . . . .$5000 and we never
could pay for it so we lost everything.   Ayear after that 
we came back with $1200.   WE bought this little home.  There
was no porch and no siding, just four little rooms, then we
add to the rooms and make a porch.   After that, we started
getting better, I started working, doing ironing for people, 
trying to send mychildren to school, cause some of them didn't
finish school, they had to quit school and go to work.
