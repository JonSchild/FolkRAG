orable hospitality, and since on
August 3 you had three guests
enroute and no room for more,
your hasty decision to beg delay
of the cousins was fully
justified by considerations of
courtesy and common sense.
Thus it might seem that if
your cousins got sore as boils
in consequence, they were merely
damming themselves as insesitive
boors. However, in fairness
to them one must say that

The Harder Thy Fall

Punchy wrecks ruled [?] words like that.

When I first met Beth Rey[?]lds and she learned that I
was in the fight racket, she called it "fascinating."
She didn't use the expression [?]more. The punch-drunk,
blinded wrecks tossed out when they were through ruled
out words like that when you got to know them.
Even while Danny and I were at the bar, a guy in a
shabby suit came toward us with the jerky, telltale gait
of the punchy. His pug-nose face bore the marks. He
threw an arm around Danny. [?] ul-la-la-lalo, Danny, old
b-b-boy-ol[?]-b-boy." He'd [?] his head to dislodge the
words.
"Hello, Joe." Danny said.  He told the bartender, "Set
up a glass for Joe Jackson."  They tapped glasses. "Happy
days," Danny said "God bless you, Joe."
Danny pressed a bill into Joe's hand. As the fighter

staggered away, he said, "Were you in the house the night
Joe fought Callahan? He was right up there with the
gods that night, laddie."
I had to leave to go up to Nick's office. I told him.
"Nick, if you stay with your idea of building this Molina
into a big-time heavyweight, I think we've all got a
chance of being held as accessories to a murder."
"You mean Molina's liable to kill somebody?"
"I mean Molina's liable to catch pneumonia and die from
the draft he creates missing all those punches. Seriously,
Nick, this guy is a joke."
"Look, Eddie," Nick said. "I want you to go out and sell
Toro Molina. Let me worry about how he lives up to his
publicity. He'll have plenty of wins."
The way he said it made me know Toro was going to

to leave the next day for a California training camp to start
the big buildup.
I had to tell Beth that night. I knew it was going to be
tough the way she was always wanting me to quit Nick and
write that play and all. But I didn't expect the way she
took this. She just looked away from me. "Maybe it's a
good idea," she said. "I think it's just about time one
of us went to California."
"You mean for good?"
"I don't know yet. All I know is that we're getting nowhere
in New York. You won't let yourself think about
where you want to go."
"Maybe we can get married when I get back."
"Maybe. We'll see."  (Continued Monday)

The Harder They Fall

"You do not see him at his best," Acosta said.

Right after George caught Toro on the jaw, the bell
sounded. Toro leaned against the ropes and shook his
head in a gesture of confusion. For two rounds his giant's
body had floundered as if it had lost all connection with
the motor impulses in his brain.
When Toro was on the rubbing table, Acosta started an
excitable explanation. "El Toro, today you do not see him
at his best. Since the climate is very different . . ."
"I theenk," said Vince, "he's a bum. But don't worry,
chummo. We've made a dollar with bums before."
"All right, out of here! I want everybody out of here,"
Danny said. I started to follow the others out and Danny
stopped me. "Straighten that Acosta out," he said, "tell
him what it's all about and have him tell this boy."
I got Acosta in the hall. I told him he'd have to explain

"You've pulled that boy out by his roots," I said.

to Toro that Nick owned him now and he'd take orders
from Danny, Nick's trainer. "You are all jealous of me,"
Acosta fumed. "Jealous because I discover El Toro. You
forget only I can make El Toro fight."
"Look," I said. "Nobody in the world can make Toro
fight unless it's Danny." I thought of the big trusting
puss being cuffed around. "Dammit, you've pulled that
boy out by his roots. You should have left him in Santa
Maria."
Acosta shrugged. "It was for his good . . "
"Baloney," I said. You saw a chance and saddled
yourself on Toro's back to make a big splash here."
Acosta told Toro about the new arrangement but you
could see the big fellow didn't like it. And I knew more
storm clouds were blowing up as soon as Danny and I

stopped in one of the gloomy little saloons near the Garden
before I went to Nick's office.
Danny threw in several fast whiskies. "Well," he said.
"Don't we have a dilly? Isn't he a beaut? If he just didn't
know anything, laddie, that wouldn't be so bad. But this
ox—he's nothing. Just a big clown. Doesn't even have the
moxie for it."
He held up his jigger ceremoniously. Danny liked to
drink fast but with a certain amount of formality. "Happy
days," he said.
Some color came into his face. His eyes were brighter.
He poured another. "It's pitiful," he said, watching a
freak like that. Nick is driving us to drink with these
lousy freaks he wants to handle. Well, happy days . . ."
