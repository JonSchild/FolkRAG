It may be necessary to appoint some person or persons to
coordinate the work that must be done for this exhibit. It is suggested
that one person be put in charge of the design and construction
which must be done. Another person can be made responsible for the
operation of these various events at the fair during the summer.

I hope that you will be able within a short time to elaborate
the plans in this letter and to work out designs for whatever equipment
is necessary, and procedures for operating whatever events are scheduled.
Nick Ray will see you in New York this Saturday and will discuss all
of these points with you at length.

Sincerely yours,
