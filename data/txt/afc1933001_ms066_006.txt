Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear John Lomax:

I have heard from Roy Harris that
there has been some misunderstanding with 
regard to the use of some folk songs in his
recently completed symphony. This work is
a task of love which I believe should be 
encouraged in every way possible. He
spent many, many months on it and, as you
probably know, the modern American composer
who writes a symphony receives little if
any remuneration for it at any time. If
you pardon my intrusion, therefore, I
should like to suggest that you grant him
his request for the use of the songs.

With best regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
