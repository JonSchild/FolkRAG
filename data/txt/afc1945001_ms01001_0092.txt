rumors will spring up. The analysis of rumors, therefore, should reveal
areas where more information is needed. Under such circumstances, a
special program should be developed, designed to blanket the field, to provide
the sort of information which would clear up the breeding ground for the 
rumors so that the rumors will die a natural death.
        Rumors will often reveal unsatisfactory community social conditions,
calling attention to the role they are playing in the social 
community and the contributions to the war effort. Where the rumors 
report, even though in somewhat exaggerated form, bad housing conditions,
it might be wiser to try to improve the housing conditions, where possible, 
rather than to try to correct the exaggerations in the rumors. While 
housing conditions may be difficult to remedy at the present time, rumors
frequently reveal dislocations in social structures which may be corrected.
Points of friction in special segments of the community, suspicions and
distrust which are developing are frequently indicated by rumor analysis.
All of these can be readily improved by the development of improved approaches
to democracy within the community. This is something which can be done;
we do not need a high priority rating to secure the intangible materials needed
for the establishment of democracy. 
        Rumors can never really be eliminated until the public has been
thoroughly educated to critical thinking and a more careful evaluation of 
information that they hear. Even though rumors in this country are to be
regarded as perfectly natural phenomena during wartime and we do not 
expect to eliminate all rumors, it may be desirable to try direct attacks
upon some rumors in the community. These direct attacks should be considered 
as but one phase of the total educational program of the local rumor
project.
