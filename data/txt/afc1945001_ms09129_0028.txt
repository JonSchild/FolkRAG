-A-
A boy of 17 wanted to join the navy. He 
was to young, of course. His mother and father didn't 
want him to join. He put his age up at his board. 
Then he finally convinced his parent to sign for
 him. 

That boy is now in the navy. He is somewhere 
in the Pacific doing a fine job for his country.

"Oh how I hate the Japanese
 I hope I never see one!" 

-C-
"Mothers give their sons; 
sons give their lives;
 for the American way of 
freedom. 
Perhaps we haven't given
 our son or our life, but 
we can give something- 
Help the Red Cross Drive 
and keep buying war
 bonds and stamp"
