Professor Lee Ellison
Texas State College for Women
Denton, Texas

Dear Professor Ellison:

On the personal invitation of President L.H.Hubbard of your college 
the next annual meeting of the Texas Folk Lore Society will be held, as you
perhaps know, at the Texas State College for Women during the first week of May,
1942.

In making up the program for the Society I should like to include
a number of papers from the students or from members of your Faculty. It seems
to me that some papers might be secured through classes in English composition
by writing essays based on local traditions,customs,etc.,existing in the communities from which your students come; of stories about practices,- playparties,
quiltings,log rollings,corn huskings,etc, which may once have existed and have
now passed out. Moreover, even since my generation the revolution in farm machinery 
has made obsolete such terms as back-bands,trace-chains,clevis,bull-tongue
plow,sweep,middle buster,etc. And about the farmhouse you no longer find the
ash-hopper,the smokehouse,the grindstone,the wooden churn and its dasher, the
spinning wheel,etc. Neighborhood stories,legends,ghost stories and the like also
exist in many old settled communities. I should like every feature of village or
country life covered by short papers to be read by the students of your College.

I have talked over this matter with President Hubbard and we
have selected you to foster some suitable plan for securing these papers. Some
time ago I had a preliminary talk on this matter with a group meeting in President Hubbard's office. He can tell you about it.

I hope you can find it possible to aid the Folk Lore Society as
I have indicated. The suggestions I have made should not in any way restrict
your freedom of action.

With kindest regards I am 
Yours always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
