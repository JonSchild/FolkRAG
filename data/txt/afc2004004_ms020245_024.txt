THE OLD ARK'S A MOVERIN'

The old ark she reel,
The old ark she rock,
The old ark a-movin'
From side to side,

Moverin', moverin',                           )    (2)
Old ark's a-moverin',                        )
I'm goin' home.                                )

Mind, my sisters,
How you walk on the cross,
Your feet may sleep
And your soul get lost.              (CHORUS)

The old ark she reel,
The old ark she rock,
The old ark's a movin'
On the mountain top.                (CHORUS)

You see these sisters
Dressed so fine,
The ain't got Jesus
On their mind.                           (CHORUS)

If you don't believe
I've been redeemed,
Follow me down
By Jerdon stream.                    (CHORUS)

Mind, my brother, 
How you walk on the cross,
Your feet may slip
And your soul get lost.           (CHORUS)

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE)             (CHORUS)

You see them brothers
Dressed so fine,
They ain't got Jesus
On their mind.                         (CHORUS)

(REPEAT FIRST VERSE)             (CHORUS)
