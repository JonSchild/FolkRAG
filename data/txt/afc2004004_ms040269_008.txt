Dear Mr. Lomax,
    With regard to the making
of some ballad recordings in the N.E. of
England, I've recently been in conversation
with Dr. Chalmers Burns, the Head if the
Department of Music in King's College,
Newcastle & he recommends that you
contact John Polwarth, 25 Sefton Avenue,
Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne.  Mr. Polwath,
with whom composer Alan Bush is staying
 this week, was formerly on the B.B.C. (North),
studying Northumbrian culture, but now
is a victim of partial paralysis.  He & his
wife are acquainted with several likely
folk singers, & would be delighted to assist
you, I believe.  Dr. Burns was visiting
him last [wee] night, & said he would
mention the idea to him.  I think this
would be your best way to start.
