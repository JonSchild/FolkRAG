     No, no, no, no. . .
     It's so sad to tell.
     I got up this morning.
     An it was, whoa, hard to tell.
 
     I walked in the correel
     And I walked it down swell
     And I couldn't find a mule
     With his shoulder well.
(speaking:)
      Well, Charlie (Salas?), ah. .  he was a
J. Savage:  ???
     Mmm. . . He's hot, -come on now, boy!
W.S. Hart:
     He was a. . he was a bad man -they said he was
old Jessie James.  Said he was old Jessie James.  And ah. . you
couldn't sing in front of him, you couldn't sing in front of
him a bit.  And he'd ride the wildest horse he had.  And that
horse be just dancing.
W.B.:
     And he was an old man!
W.S.H.:
     Yeah, he was.  He was really old --he look like
ol' Jesse James, he reminded me of Jesse James-
W.B.:
     He was an old man!
W.S.H.:
     They said he was ol' Jesse James.  I used
to work for him.  He said, "What's you name?".  I said,
"My name is William S. Hart".  "Huh!. .  Shit! --
(never have enough bulled outa you yet?)  to pack up William
S. Hart's ass!"  (laughs)  I said, "O.K."  I get out there and
got my team, man.  I'd get way back on them a-lines, you know-
-two great big ol mules.  Trace straps all on them, they head
up in the air like that (pulls his head back), with them
harness on 'em, everywhere you can -tassles hangin all down
the side of 'em.  Just takin their time, walkin. . . just walkin
and walkin.  Every once in a while, I'd sing-
(singing:)
     I'm gonna be late in the morning
     I'm gonna be late all day

     I'm gonna be late all day
     I wanna be late all day
