The mid-day meal is carried to the fields. During the day time houses are
bolted, and there is little evidence of life except in the fields. Occasionally
two or three small children may be seen seated listlessly on the porch --
being mothered by the oldest of the group, a child of six or seven who is too
young to be of much value in the field.

The family structure seems to be geared to the economics of the
system. A family too small cannot support itself. A family is too large
only when it has too many non-productive children. The most efficiently family
unit is one that has the largest number of full or part-time workers with
least consumption demands. Families that cannot balance themselves have
trouble surviving. A study made in 1936 of 6,486 Negro farm families in
Shelby County shows that out of 693 families with five persons in each
household, 656 had five persons in the "economic family", while 337 families
out of 347 with seven members in the household had seven persons in
the "economic family." (1)

The number of acres under cultivation tends slightly to vary with
the tenure status of the farmer. Our study of Negro farm families in the
County revealed that full farm owners cultivate on the average 22.7 acres,
although eight had over 100 acres under cultivation, and one owner had over
600 acres in crops. Purchasing farm owners have a smaller acreage under
cultivation than full owners, the median being 18.6 acres with no farmer
cultivating over 110 acres. The median number of acres cultivated by cash
