Fisk 22.8.3

Don't a man feel sorry when the good Lord’s sun
is gone down
arms around

Um - um um
Lord have mercy
I sho do feel low down
I'm always worried and poutin all the time

I ain't gon be your low down dog no mo
when I leave this time, I'm goin  [???]
you do

[Levee Camp Holler]
Black Mans Blues ...

Um - um - um 
Why don't catch my Shetland
And saddle up my black mare,
Why don't you catch my Shetland 
Saddle up my black mare,
You know, I'm ‘on’ find my baby,
off in the world somewhere

He's a traveling  pony & he don't deny his name,
The way he can travel is a low down dirty shame
Looky here horse come & let's us go,
Let's we travel on down to the Gulf of Mexico
