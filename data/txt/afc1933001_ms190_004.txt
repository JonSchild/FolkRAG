Mr. Vance Randolph
Galen, Missouri

Dear Vance:

     I have been staging an uphill and, I am sorry to
say, losing fight on the matter of the fellowships. There
seems to be no way for me to get the government to ask for
an exemption to be made in the gas and tire rationing regulations
for the fellowship plan. Since that is true, it looks
like the kind of wide-range folklore collecting we want to do
is out for the duration. If, however, you already have plans 
in which I could help you, you know I'd back you up to the
hilt. 

     With many regrets, I am,
    
     Sincerely yours,

     Alan Lomax
     Division of Educational Services
