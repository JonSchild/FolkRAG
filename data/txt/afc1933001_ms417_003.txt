ONE 
BIG UNION 
SECTION 

WELL, after the dust go so bad you couldn't recognise 
a politician on the streets, I says to my wife, you know I 
believe I'll whale away and go to California, everybody else 
is. Wheat fields a turnin' into deserts, tractors all covered 
up with dust, tumble weeds up against the fences, and dust piled 
all over the posts .... this business of Faith Healing is all 
right ... I believe with all of my heart and soul that Faith will 
heal almost any ailment under the sun. Somebody's Faith. 

I got struck with the idea that God was all, that there was 
just the ONE, just the ONE Big Something, I didn't know what. 
But whatever it was, It made all that was, all that is, and all 
that ever will be. It made the crops, and the winds and the rains, 
and the snows and the hail storms and the dust storms, and the 
things that grow up out of the ground, and all of the gold and coal 
and iron you find under the ground ..... and it didn't belong to 
no certain feller. 

It all belonged to everybody. 

More than anything in the world, I believed that ... I believed 
that it all belong to you and me, and him, and her, and Aunt Kate, 
and Sister Sue, and grandpa, and even grandma, and even the neighbors. 
It even belonged to people you hadn't seen and didn't 
know. It didn't belong to no certain feller. It didn't belong 
to no certain family. It didn't belong to just a few families. 
Hells bells, Nelly, it belonged to everybody. Same time, it 
didn't belong to nobody. Not just a few. But the whole dern 
bunch.
