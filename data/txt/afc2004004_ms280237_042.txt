Lomax: And what aboutt e Norfolk Broads themselves. They used

Cox: No, they can't own now. You can't stop any body from going
in tidal waters. When they come up to London now in this

keep people out. They can't stop you from going right where
the tide flow. You can go wherever the tide flow. I think
ther 's some tide here on ? Broad. These here people they
didn't know, I reckon, they didn't know there was a tide.
Lomax: Tell me, how did a farm labourer live in your father's

Cox: Tough. Yes, I heard him talk about it, his time, he told
me he break his neck, near like, for a crust of bread.
