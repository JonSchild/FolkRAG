Which the capitalist is trying--
And the overlord so bold.
We will save our farms for farmers,
And we'll prosper many fold
As we go fighting on.

We will save this noble nation
From a strong and subtle foe,
Which has threatened its foundation,
Struck at Liberty a blow;
But our mighty organization
Says the land baron must go
And we'll go farming on.

Chorus.
Join, oh join the Farmers' Union,
Talk, oh talk for Farmers' Union,
Work, oh work for Farmers' Union,
As it goes marching on.                              ---Nellie A. Vail.

'TIL THE FARMER'S TREATED WHITE
Tune--Sidewalks of New York.
Farmer's Union o'er the U. S. A.,
Winning recognition,
As it battle day by day,
Gaining legislation, for our marketing plan.
Adding power to our program
For the good of common man.

Farmer's Union, let your task be known,
The sky is clear above you
And your records can be shown.
Gaining power by virtue, proud of the might of right,
Never cease your effort
'Til the farmer's treated "white."

------------------------

     Nothing succeeds like success. The Union is progressively successful, numerically and financially. It is the most beneficient influence in American Rural life today and I am proud and glad to be one of its members.
