Improvement of the government service is a major purpose of
the United Federal Workers of America. It expects every member
to contribute to the increasingly high quality of our public

duties. The United Federal Workers of America expects each
one of its members to be constantly aware of his high obligation
as a government worker and his solemn duty as a citizen.
