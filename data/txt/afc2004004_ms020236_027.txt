big farm an' eggs -- Jus' didn' like the colored folks to live 
that way; that was all.  So he on'y stayed there 'till that year 
was up.   An' he lef'.   An' he come back on the Dawson side, where 
he could rent an' lease an' do what he want.  You know, enjoy 
himself.   Jus' (liable to be free - afraid)
'Cause he was stayin' out with the crowd of us when I lef' home.  
Like he stayed, he had a big rentin' place out there, a nice place.  
An' everybody look like they was enjoy it.  Ha!  White folks go 
out there, sometimes, so early in the morning; be huntin' 
squirrels.  Tell him, "Did you kill many squirrels this mornin', 
Gene?"   My uncle, he's a great hunter, a great squirrel hunter.  
Shoot 'em, you know.  People claims it's hard to kill a squirrel, 
but he hardly ever miss 'em.  He go out early in the morning an' 
kill a squirrel, an' peoples call  'im out [at 'im] -- many times I seen 
white men standin' in the yard an' Uncle Gene would [get a] gi' 
'em a squirrel.

BJ:        Corn hustling?

BJ:        I say shuckin'.
TL:        Shucking!
BJ:        Because that's the same thing, also.  But I have corn 
husked.   But that was in Maryland.
TL:        How did you used to corn-shuck?
BJ:        Corn-shuckin's jus' shuckin' the corn off.  You done shuck 
it; you shuck with your hand[?   the iron?)]. . .We used to have 
parties an' shuck it down there.   Jus' shuck it, tha's all.   Jus' 
pull the shucks off the corn, tha's all.   An' ah, jus' racin' one 
another, see who can beat shuckin' the corn.  Tha's all. . .Yeah, 
we had a lot of fun.   Cause they race you know, too, them old 
folks.  An' we chilrun race together.   'Till our time to go to 
bed; that was jus' good.    An' shellin' it, too.  You take one 
cob an'after you shell off, then take [another] one cob an' do it with 
the other.   'Cause, see, you ruin your hand if you shell with 
your hand.   See, you take a cob, jus' [a small] hol' a small piece 
of cob, in your han', see, an' shell down on the corn that way.  
You see?  Jus' shell it off.
TL:        Take the corn right off the cob, huh?
BJ:        Tha's right.  Another cob, see.
