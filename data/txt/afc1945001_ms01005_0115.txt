Introduction:  There is too much stress on the "frankly exploratory" 
nature of the study.  Rumor is not a subject in which
elaborate or expensive methods  need to be used.  A
slightly wider sample and more use of rumor collections
already available, (e.g. bi-monthly reports
from Boston) would make this a wholly adequate study
on which to base a policy in rumor control.
   I object to the implication that we must have finer
and finer studies.  What we need is more and more
utilization of such studies as are made.
   What is a rumor?  Although the broad definition is
desirable and it is well to record "too much rather
than too little," still the collection includes
straight opinions (not rumors) e.g. "England starts
it and expects us to finish it."  There could have
been more sifting in order to differentiate better
the specific rumor from the underlying attitude.

More and more publicity should be given to such\
findings.
   The section on the "Effect of Humor" is good but too
brief.  It is here that the method of the intensive
interview should yield rich returns.
Page 5:  Subject matter:  The classification by subject matter
should be dictated by action-policy.  Thus, all rumors
that the Army can disinfect should be grouped, also
those that "belong" to the Navy, to OCD, to the
policy officers of OWI, etc.
   This criticism shows up the principal weakness of the
report --- that is not geared to action.
   Psychological type.  In Boston we have found less and
less use for the "curiosity" type of rumor, and I am
surprised to find so many in this report.  Nowhere is
the "curiosity" rumor defined adequately.  Here is a
problem for solution in future typologies of rumor.
An analysis of 765 rumors reported to Boston did not
necessitate this category at all; if it were used, it
would have been much smaller than the 35 per cent in
the present report.

only have been secured by intensive interviews.  But
what is its practical implication?
