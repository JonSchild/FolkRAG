Dear Bessie,

Thank you for your various nice letters.  The reviews
 that you have sent are marvelous.  I'll keep them
safe for you here in your file.

I have no news of other engagements for you at this
point, but this is imply because i have been too
busy to work for the group in the last month.  I
hope next week I'll have some time, and I'll try to 
make some 'phone calls and write some letters.

I am glad to hear that you and the group are going
to South Carolina to work with Guy.  You'll have 
fun and learn a lot there, and I'll be there.  We
can meet and talk over plans at that time.

Meantime, much love to you all.
