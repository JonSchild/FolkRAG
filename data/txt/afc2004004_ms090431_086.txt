A: Were these dances as ro ugh as they are nowadays?
S: No sir. They used to hardly have a fight. That is before
Prohibition,

care for it. If a man got drunk, they'd just take and lay him off
aside and keep on dancing.
A: How long did these dances last -- all night long?
S: Sometimes they'd last all night long. Sometimes in the Christmas
they'd last two days. Dance all night til they just give out and
quit and son they'd get rested and catch come sleep, they'd just
dance aga n.
A: Lots of courting going on I guess?
S: Yessir.
A: Were the girls so free as they are nowadays?
S: No sir, they were not. Gi rls were kind of particular. Is that
running now?
A: No!

TOAST.
As I was walking down the street,
A pretty girl I chanced to meet.
I took her to her father's dwelling h ouse
And we crept in as quiet as a mouse.
We laid down the curtai s and the windows, too.
I asked her for some of her doodle-li-doo.
Said "doogle-li-doo -- what's that?"
Just like you mother's old pussy-cat.
Hairy all around and split in two,
That's what I call doodle-li-doo.

Her father say, she say, "Father, father, forgive me too.
Forgive Johnny some of my doodle-li-doo."
Her father say, "You angel child,
Now you gonna have a little crocodile..
You learned your repetition when I was two
For being it from with your doodle-li-doo."

Her mother say, "You Goddamn bitch;
I wish to God I had a [?] switch.
I'd cut your ass b th black and blue
And sew up your granny-dog (?)
And doodle-li-doo.
(laughter)
