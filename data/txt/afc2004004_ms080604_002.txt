Bill Gordon:
When I went to work out there to work for (?).
And the man said he gonna pay off my... - city, city bank paid
me off something else.   I asked him why - 'bout my other
money.   He said, "Well, that's for in the (corral?)".  I said,
"I didn't eat in the (corral?)," I said, "I eat in the
camp." He said, "Well, you shoulda ate out there, it was out
there for you." I said, "Well, I didn't know nothin' 'bout
that".  So, next week --next two weeks, he paid me all my

come around singin': (speaking) [*[Rhymes]*] [*Verse*] "Get up - sleeping good?,

in his bed and callin' it bunk. So nows ya goin'?  
A.L.:
