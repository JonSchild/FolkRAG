Dear Dave:
I'm glad to know the program is going on on the 19th.
"Old Joe Clark" might be a good theme tune. If not, I
still vote for Buffalo Gals. My home address is Route 1,
Maclean, Virginia, but during the week, it is best to write
to me at the Library.

Best regards,

PsS. I like most of what adiman had added to the script
very much.

P.S.S. I shall need the other half of my money for my
second trip to New York. I realize this is an
imposition, but the summer time always finds me
much embarrassed for funds.
