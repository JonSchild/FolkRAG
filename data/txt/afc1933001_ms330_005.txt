There whe Campie John set free.
There you will see good sheddie Roker.
Pin beneath that Dillie tree.

Roam a sweet girl age and drooping.
Outcast of a roving pack.
Kiss by gene and Elgin Neelie.

Leave her Roared Andrew Taylor. 3
Dont kiss her just let her sleep.
Then you will see good sheddie Roker.
Pin beneath that Dillie heap.
