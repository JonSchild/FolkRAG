BJ TAPE 12, p. 14

AL:  She didn't see you dancing?
BJ:  She didn't see me dancin', no.
AL:  She never has?
BJ:  Never has, ho, ha!  An' brother! Oow, I felt like a cut
dawg!  I said, "If this ain't sumpin'!"  An' I...An' today she
don't know I came out there to the dance.  I will not tell 'er!
An', ah, I was gonna slip out there an' ha' myse'f a dance, an'
git back home...ha, ha, ha, ha.
     You know, [an'] the hat man, when they all come back to the car,
you know, to go back to town, to wait 'till I get through dancin'
or whatnot, I was ready to go to town.  Well, they
wasn't ready, I jus' went on back.  I tol' 'em, said, "I'm goin'
back home now, 'cause I'm not gonna stay out no, not no longer'n
twelve."
     An' I's just through with it.  Just as through with it as
anything.  Jus' like somebody throwed water on the ground.  Was
jes' all over with, with me.  With dancin' an' with keepin' her
from, you know, enjoyin' herself so she'd be in a good place.
AL:  How old was she?
BJ:  Huh?
AL:  How old was she then?
BJ:  Fo'teen...Um-hum.
AL:  Bessie, you told me a story one time that Toni didn't hear,
I don't believe, and that was when you were going with those
girls who were hustling somewhere...
BJ:  That was when...
AL:  ...and you were...
BJ:  Didn', didn' you put it on?
