Dear Mr.Lomax:

Very glad to hear from you again.
Had lost track of you and did not know where you 
were.

I am enclosing parts of the Ox-Driving 
song as remembered by me but it is still very incomplete.  
Have been away recently and efforts to gather 
from others additional parts of the song were unsuccessful.  
I am now writing my brothers in California whom 
I believe can add much to what I am sending and suggest 
you wait a while if you can as I am requesting them to 
advise me quickly.

I was a real pleasure to have you and your 
wife in our home and we hope you will come again.

My sister thinks the town of Saludio is 
in Mo. of Ky.,probably where it originated (the song), 
My father knew it, I think,when he came to Texas in 
1855.  Are you going to preserve the "HAND MADE SERVANT" 
prayer of Will Leo?

Glad Elizabeth is well.  Her mother left 
for Dallas last Wednesday.  I do not believe I have met 
Alan and hope he comes this way sometime.

I will write you just as soon as I hear 
from my brothers about the song.  We can finally get it 
together but I do not know how long it might take.

Sincerely yours,
H.R.Weaver
