Dear Mr. Lomax,
At last there is a definite assignment on 
my piece from the Ladies Home Journal, and I am getting 
started on it immediately. I wanted to tell you about this 
so that, if there is any recent news which should be 
included, or any developments we didn't discuss, you might 
write me. 
With best regards - 
Sincerely,
Hilda Cole
