NOW, I WARN ALL YOU DARKIES

March 9, 1942

Mr. Harold B. Armitage
3 West  Eighth Street
New York, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Armitage:

We in the Music Division have done our best 
to uncover the tune you are in search of, 
but we have not succeeded, although we have
found the references to it in song books containing
your song, Joaquin the Horsethief.
As regards other outlaw songs, you will find
several in American Ballads and Folk Songs,
by John A. and Alan Lomax. Although some 
of these describe the final punishment of
the individual, I don't know whether they
will suit your purpose, since the tendency
in folk outlaw ballads is to sympathize 
rather than to condemn.

Please let me know if I can be of further
help.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
