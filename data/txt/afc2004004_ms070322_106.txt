Thursday afternoon.

I've been writing all day in a
rather desperate mood. Putting down
whatever came, knowing it wasn't 
good or final, hoping I'd find
some scenes or lines coming clear
& would soon find what the problems
and limitations of the whole script
are. Now at mid career in this
new approach to writing I'm
rather [panicky].

I've never been fluent or preliminary
before, never worked from an routine,
never written a piece of pure fiction
never departed from settings in
which I at least new every bit
of dialect, background, etc. 
Not only that but last night
having talked with a Donegal 
man about the kind of 
place my Torey Island is
