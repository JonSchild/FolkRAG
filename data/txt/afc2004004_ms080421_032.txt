Time Code:  Tape: R. Hicks & Friends

you know, I went one way and Jim the other. He took ...
his boy ... his axe and chopped
the wire through and he broke one 1/2 gallon of this whiskey. So I went
on down through here, there's an old barn down [through] there, down
here pretty close to where I had to stay, Juke boy, you know, Ed.
So we run up in the barn loft there, and I had two 1/2 gallons and he
had one, and we waited a good long while, and the party didn't come 
up
