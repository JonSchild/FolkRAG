Dear Mme. Sylvan:

I am sure that if you knew what turmoil my life had been in
since you left, you would forgive me for not having written you
previously. I have often thought of our brief visit together
with warm pleasure, and with deep gratitude for the help you gave
in straightening out a very thorny catalog matter.  You may be
sure that what you have done is deeply appreciated by myself and
by the Library of Congress, and that if there is anything I can
ever do to assist you in any of your many important projects I
shall be completely at your service.

We lunched with:
Charles Seeger, Director of the Music Center of
the Pan American Union
Gustavo Duran, Music Center of the Pan American 
Union
Dr. Donald Doherty, American Council of Learned
Societies, 1219 Sixteenth St., N.W.
Benjamin Botkin, Folklore Fellow, Library of
Congress
All of these persons are, of course, located in Washington, D.C.
Dr. Doherty was much interested in various matters we discussed
and I think it would be a very good thing if you were to keep in
touch with him.

I am much interested in the notion of your working in the
creole area in Louisiana, and I hope that after you have considered
the problems involved you will let me know what you think might 
fruitful. I believe that I might be able to obtain some
material aid for such a project.

It might also be desirable for you to consider that further
work in the way of recording in Haiti should be done, once you
have been able to hear the Courlander recordings. I hope to have
the opportunity of discussing both of these matters with you in
the future.  If it is ever possible for you to come back to
Washington, we have a little more work to do on the catalog, but
there is no great hurry about this.
