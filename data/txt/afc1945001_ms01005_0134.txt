RE: Rumor reports

I am releasing the letter[s] to Mr. Bezanson, but further
letters on "rumors" should be help up pending the policy approval
of Mr. Davis to the plan being worked out by Mr. Rosten. I do not
know whether his plan evisions sending copies of our expurgated
Rumor Report or not. Let's wait and see. Mr. Rosten says that he
will have his plan ready in a few days.
