Speaker at Dearborn Exchange Club related experiences at
Sault St. Marie, and stated that Negro soldiers were conducting
themselves so that local enforcement officers,
county sheriff's department and state police were unable
to cope with situation and appeals had been made direct
to Washington for assistance.
Specific nations included holding up of a white couple
two negro soldiers and raping of the woman by both
negroes, who later were apprehended and tried. Nightly
slashings and cuttings of other negroes supposedly were
common occurrences, one such slashing being so severe
that white nurse who attended the physician, and who had
been practicing for 18 years, fainted.
Negro soldiers cross over to Canada, where they tell the
girls there that they are South American Indians, and 
have become so popular that white soldiers are unable to
obtain dates. This last rumor, if true, appears to me
to be rather innocuous.

[*3.*]Patient employed at the Bomber Plant informed me of the installations
of air conditioning and individual lockers which
appeared (at this time) to be an unnecessary expenditure of
money and vital materials. The air-conditioning equipment
includes conduits, electric motors and fans, and the amount
of metal for the lockers, used mostly for hanging coats and
hats, seems disproportionate in view of it necessity in 
more urgent fields.
