Dear Dr. Spivacke: 
In regard to Mr. Alistair Cooke's plans, it is my understanding 
that he will leave with the Library the originals of whatever recordings 
he makes using our equipment. These records, if they are made following 
certain suggestions which we have already discussed, will be a 
worthy addition to our growing file of documentary recordings. I 
suggest that the Model Y machine be lent to him at least for this 
first week-end, October 31 to November 2. 
Respectfully yours, 

Alan Lomax
