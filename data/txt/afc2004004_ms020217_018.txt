You know we used to have a word, "Double-dog-dare-you."  We thought
that was a big word, you know -- double-dog-dare-you.  "Go out there
in that water and I double-dog-dare you to come back."  Sayin'' things:
"Shut up!"  One a-hollerin' and act like it was her, y'know, "Ah, ah,
no, woah."  Them was good times, good times...That was honor; honor
to your parents; you'd better honor 'em, see?  But we went home and
said no kinda word or we wouldn't a-been here today.  If we did we
wouldn't a-been straight.  They would-a whup our heads right together;
I know they would...

AL:     Somebody told me about the old folks in Louisiana, that an old
man would rule his child right up 'till the end of his life, would
take a gun and shoot him if he didn't do...

BJ:      A lot of 'em do that
