Mr. John A. Lomax,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Herewith "Old Paint".

"Farewell fair ladies, I'm leaving Cheyenne,
Farewell fair ladies, I'm leaving Cheyenne,
Goodbye my little Donie, my ponie won't stand,
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne.

Chorus

Goodbye, Old Paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne,
Old Paint, Old Paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne.

IN the middle of the ocean may grow a green tree,
But I'll never prove false, to the girl that loves me.
(Chorus)

Oh, the last time that I saw her, 'twas late in the fall,
She was ridin' Old Paint, and a-leadin' Old Ball.
(Chorus)

Old Paint's a good pacer, he paces when he can,
Goodbye, Old Paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne.
(Chorus)

Oh, we spread down our blankets on the green grassy ground,
The horses and cattle were grazing around.
(Chorus)
