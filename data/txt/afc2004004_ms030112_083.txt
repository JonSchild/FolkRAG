MRS. DAVIS:
the hospital a lot, even out here and downtown all of them. But all of them missed the funeral. And you know who else would have missed the funeral some people from Connecticut his name is Chuck, him and his wife and some friend, they came here from he was supposed to have left the house at 6:30 and the undertaker said to me and he got here about 15 minutes a head of time. So he said like this, I don't see any need in waiting, so we went on we missed people so, these people from Connecticut were there. Cause my friends sister, when she came by to go along with us and she told them before she got in the car showed them how to get there, Saw them Friday, they called me since the funeral.
