German has been going very nicely; I made A on my midsemester
but I still need the rest of the summer's work put in on it. Mrs. Dingus
wants to offer the second year course x in reading the second six weeks 
if she can get enough people to take it. If enough want it, I think maybe
I should stick around and do it though I certainly don't want to. But it
is that very don't wanting to that makes me feel I probably ought to keep 
on with German in an academic fashoin, because I'm afraid I won't do it
if I am not pretty well forced into it. Languages in their early stages
aren't very exciting; at least I've never found them so. However, the xxxx
matteris questionable since they haven't enough people yet to offer the 
course and I think we should certainly confer on it. You know there are 
lots of other ways I would rather spend my summer than doing German, but
since I've got it to do I guess I must plan my summer pretty much around
it. But I do want to come to see you.

Have you heard any more about the Potts' going up to New York?
I don't have Mary Anne's address or I would xx write her about it myself.
That would certainly be an ideal way to get x back up, though, thank goodness
the event is some time off yet. 

I'm having a really lovely time here this summer; I don't think
I have ever enjoyed Shirley or the children as much. And Chris has me 
helping him in the shop from time to time; he's already made me a lovely 
jewel box, and he's wanting to do me a table. With this and Grandmother's
table Shirley's saving for me, x I will practically be able to set up
housekeeping when the time comes. After all, what more do you need than
a table and a jewel box?

Please write me soon. I'm about run out of money what with all
