Proudly sweeps the rain-cloud o'er the cliff,
Born swiftly by the western gale,
While the song of lovers' parting grief
Sadly echoes amid the flow'ring vale.

Refrain: Farewell to thee, farewell to thee!
The winds will carry back my sad refrain;
O ne fond embrace before we say good-bye
Until we meet again.

I have fondly watched thy lovely face,
Bright rose of Maunawili's bow'r,
Where the birds sip honey from thy lips,
Sweeter far than the dewy op'ning flow'r.

Refrain:

Sweet the thoughts I bear away with me,
Dear mem'ries of the happy past;
And tho' now we whisper, far-thee0well,
Yet we know we shall meet again at last.


CO MIN' THRO' THE RYE.

If a body meet a body,
Comin' thro the rye,
If a body kiss a body
Need a body cry?

Chorus: Ev'ry lassis has her laddie,
Nane they say ha' I;
Yet a' the lads they smile on me,
When comon' thro the rye.

If a body meet a body,
Comin' frae the town,
If a body greet a body
Need a body frown?

Chorus:

Amang the train there is a swain
I dearly love mysel',
But what's his name or where's his hame,
I dinna choose to tell.
