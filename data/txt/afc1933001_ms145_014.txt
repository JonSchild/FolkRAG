Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City
Dear Mr. Lomax:
   In your recent letters you always state that you enclose something
or other and then fail to do so.  This time it as your
Father's last letter.
   I have one piece of good news and one piece of bad new for you.
First of all, I have heard that the that the Committee of the Council
has made a grant of $500 to you.  This must still be confirmed by
the Executive Committee but I understand that that is merely a
routine matter.  The bad news is that the Carnegie Corporation has
tuned us down flat.  I just heard this a few moments ago so that I
have had no time to formulate new plans.
   I was delighted to hear about your proposed work with the Columbia
Phonograph Company and hope that something materializes.  I
have no personal objections to your staying on in New York for while,
but if you want per diem allowance for this, I suggest that you send 
me a formal request so that I may make the proper recommendation to
the Librarian.
   I am enclosing a letter from Botkin with reference to some
Mississippi songs.  Please let me have your suggestions in this matter
by return mail.
   I was unable to write Frank Walker until recently so I do not
expect an answer for several days yet.
   In view of the shocking news just received about our grant, I
am afraid that we shall have to postpone discussion about new machinery
for the time being.
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
