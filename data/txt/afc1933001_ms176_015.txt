Dear Dr. Spivacke:
   I have just received work from Mrs. Tartt that the 
weather has turned out to be so bad in Alabama this early fall
that it will be impossible for her to do good work for us until
spring. I wish, therefore, to suggest that $150.00 of the $800.00
originally set aside for this trip to be allowed for further expenses
to Mr. John A. Lomax, who is at present in the field and engaged
in work which he wishes to continue. This would make a total 
of $300.00 allowed to Mr. Lomax and would leave $500.00 for
Mrs. Tartt's trip next spring. I think this will probably be
ample for that purpose.

Respectfully yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
