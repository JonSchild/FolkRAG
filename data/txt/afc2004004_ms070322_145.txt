9) O Jock Smith the blacksmith
Wo' focht the boors
He jumped on the table
An he shouted out for hours

10) The village postie he was there
He had a dose of pox
He couldnae find a lassie
So he fucked the letter box

11) The kril blacksmith he was there
He was a mighty man
His bollocks were twin bars of brass
They rattled as he ran

12) The village nancey he was there
He was a filthy beast
He stuffed a wine glass up his ass
And circumcised the priest

13) Jimmy Maxton, he was there,
He deeved us all for hours
A-ratin' o'er his policy
Tae nationalize the hoors
