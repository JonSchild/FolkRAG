Dear H W. Lomax,
Thank you for the letter &
cheque for 2 pounds sent to me.  It took
some time to reach me as it went
first to my home in Shetland before
being forwarded to me here in Edinburgh
It gives me great pleasure to 
think that I was able to contribute
to your album & so help to make
Scottish poekodng better known,-
especially those of Shetland.
I feel bound, however, to draw
to your attention the fact that in
the record of "Da Bressay Lullaby"
I sang only two ousen I here there
