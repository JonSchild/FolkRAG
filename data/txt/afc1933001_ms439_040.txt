Boll Weevil

Talls about your lates'
Yo' lates' of yo' own
These devilish boll-wevils
Comin' rob us of our homes
Ry:  Ide'll have a home (2)
Fust time I seed him
Ide,
Nex' time
He was spreadin' evr'where

Ol' lady & the farmer
Was walkin' 'cross the fiel'
Ol' lady tol the farmer
I found a lotta meat & meal

Frmer tol' de ol' lady
What do you think o' dat
I got 1 of them half weevils
Out of my stetson hat
It's full of holes (2)
