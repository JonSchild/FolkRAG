Blue-eyed Susy--

Sometimes drunk, sometimes woozy, sometimes dance with my blue-
eyed Susy
Love my wife, love my baby, and I love them flapjacks floatin'
in gravy.
All I want to make me happy is two little boys to call me Pappy.
One named Dick, the other named Davy: Come to your Daddy, you
pore little baby.

(First Figure)   

Pardners to their places,
Like mules to their traces.
Put your hands in your pockets,
Turn your backs to the wall,
Take a chew of tobacco,
And balance all.
Swing your pardners
Corners all
Now your pardners
And promenade the hall

First couple one to the couple,
On to the right, and round up four.

Elbow hug and Chinese swing,
Sandhill twist and a double swing,
On to the next, and the next
couple follows. 

(Note-repeat clear around till the 
last couple has finished)

Balance all,
Swing your corner and swing it 
with a smile,
Grab your honey and go hog wild.

---------------------

(Second Figure)

Everybody dance as pretty as you can,
Swing your corner with your right hand,
Pardner with your wrong,
Grand right and wrong all night long.
Watch your pardner, watch her close,
When you meet her double the dose.
Hang your dogs and kill your cats. 
And double the dose with "Rough on ats."

Lawd, Lawd, ain't we got fun? (shouted)

Dance up, boys, and don't be slow,
All these girls are r'arin' to go,
All you gals who don't wear
socks
Shake your hips and rattle your
hocks

Meet your honey and promenade
home

(Third Figure)

Swing on the corner like swinging on
a gate,
Now your honey and pull your freight,
First couple out the couple on the 
right 
Lady around the lady and gents so low,
Lady around the gent and the gent
don't go.
Swing with your right and now your
wrong,
Doce ladies all night long.
On to the next, chase the possum,
chase the skunk,
Chase that pretty girl around the 
chunk
Ladies doce and gents go gee,
Swing that pretty girl and then swing
me.
(And so on until the last couple has 
gone around)       

Everybody dance
Swing your pardner and promenade 
the hall for the last time.
