Column One
DON'T GIVE UP THE STRIKE
(Tune: Don't Give up the Ship) 

Strikers stand together 
Don't give up the strike.
Fair or stormy weather,
We won't give up,
We won't give up the strike. 

Friends and pals forever,
We are bound to win,
We're not going to take a licking,
Carry on and quit your kicking,
Don't give up the strike.

DOLLARS FROM CHRYSLERS
(Pennies from Heaven)

Everytime it rains, it rains,
Dollars from Chryslers
Don't you know our strike contains
Dollars rom Chryslers.
You'll find your paychecks rising,
As we go along;
If we keep harmonizing,
We can't go wrong.
Now, there's a pot of gold for you
If you'll keep your dues up,
You can't get the things you love,
If you don't pay up.
So as the hours go by,
Don't get lowdown or blue
There'll be dollars from Chryslers
For all of you  

GOODY GOODY
So the union boys have set you
back on your heels
Goody, Goody
So they're sitting down and now
you know how it feels
Goody, goody.
So they're down in your plant too
They'll be sure to see it thru
And the women are behind them
Now how do you do?
So you lie awake
just singing the blues all nite
Goody ,goody
Cause this union gangs a barrel
of dynamite
Hurray and hallelujah
You had it coming to ya,
Goody, goody for you,
Goody, goody for us,
And we hope you're satisfied
You rascal you.

KEEP THE PICKETS MARCHING
Keep the pickets marching
While the boys are sitting
Though we don't get any pay
We don't mind a bit

There's a silver dollar,
For each strikers hour,
Let them all negotiate,
With the C.I.O.

THE WOMEN"S AUXILIARY THEME SONG
Tune: Marching Thru Georgia
1. The men are in the factories
sitting in a strike we know,

Holding down production so that
we can get more dough,
The Union's organizing, and we'll
see that it is so,
Shouting the Union forever.
Chorus:
Hurrah, hurrah, it's all for 
you and me,
Organize your brothers and we'll
win the fight you'll see
Shouting the Union forever.

2.
The women get together and they
formed a mighty throng
Every workers wife and mom and
sister will belong
They will fight beside the men
to help the cause long
Shouting the Union forever.

3.
Homer Martin is the leader of
this mighty band
And we'll stand behind him for
the future of the land,
We won't give up the battle till
we get our just demands
Shouting the union forever.
4.
When the battled over and we're
back to work once more
There will not be a single scab
inside the factory door.
The men will wear their butons
and the bosses won't get sore
Shouting the Union forever.

LOST
Lost, my liberal point of view,
Lost, my reputation too,
Lost, my plants and my stoolies to
Strikers, keepers, losers weepers
Lost, my company union too
Labor said it wouldn't do,
I must give in, cause they'll 
surely win,
I've lost and from now on they'll
grin
Lost, my daily output too
Lost, a lot of profits too
Lost, a dividend that's due,
Strikers, keepers, losers weepers
Lost my bet and how I rue it
Lost my luck and am I blue,
They are in, they're kicked me
in the chin
