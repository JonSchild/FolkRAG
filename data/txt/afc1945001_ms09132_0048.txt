[*F.N. Female*]

1. Uncle Sam may not be a woman but he can sure get
your man. 
2. Many of you have probably never heard of the "B" Class in the
army: "Be here when you go and be here when you come back."
3. As a receiver of letters from numerous [?] boys in the army
camps from various sections of the South, their letters seem
to express a great deal of discontent because of the attitude that is
given toward them. Their morale seems to me to be the lowest
by not being accustomed to the ignorant whites of that South.
