They were Masons together.
Ain't nothin gits you no worse than the music from the organ from 
a funeral. Thass somethin you'll never git out of your head from a funeral. 
I know from the time my sistah died. All that from way back there. I can 
still jes think about the sound. of those organs goin. thass sumpin you 
nevah git out of your min. I mean you don't nevah forgit it. Whenever you 
heah that sound I mean it always bring that memory back to you. Some time 
opera pieces that are very easy -- slow -- be played it sound jes as the 
same thing. An you always heah that same soun again. if you ever once 
hear it at a funeral. at some of yo peoples' funeral. I mean anytime at 
night that theme organ come on over the radio always make me think of it. 
Tiny was sayin the same thing, say, "I'll nevah in this life forgit the 
sound of that organ that night." She said thass the onliest thing that 
got her worse than anything. But I thought twas wonderful, all that playin 
an music an everything.
(You looked so pretty that night, Martha.)
Well thass what everybody say but I don't remembah. Onliest thing I 
remembah is goin in that church. I don't remembah a thing in this world. 
I don't remembah a thing but goin in that place. An the last when I got 
up to look at him. Thass all I remembah. I called to Huddie's niece then 
an I remembah she sayin, "Don't cry. If you don't cry I won't cry. She 
was tryin to stop  me from cryin. Thass the onliest thing. I don't remembah 
none of the funeral through worth nothin. I was jes out of my 
mind the whole time. You know, I'm tellin you, it's a tough thing. 
It's jes a difference in peoples I think. Cause I'm tellin [on] you, it 
wasn't even that hard on me for my mother. An my father either. Maybe 
cause I wasn't as old. I didn't realize it as much. I think the same thing 
will happen to me if my sustah goes fore I do. [Mayr] Mary. Her especially. 
I [can] mean the other part of the family I don't think will be as bad.
