Dear John Lomax:

    As Harold wrote you some time ago, all our machines are out
and this still continues to be the case.

    I wish that we did have more of them so that we could place
them strategically around the country. What we are attempting to
do in this connection in order that the machines can be most
profitably used is to place them with an institution such as the
University of California, University of Arizona or the New York
Public Library , in order that a sufficient number of collectors
in the area may use the one machine. We feel that this will do
several things: (1) It will stimulate local collectors; (2) create
an interest at the institution in question to establish a state
archive of folk materials; and (3) make it possible for the Library
of Congress to purchase or exchange folklore materials with the
institution. Then, as the institution's interest in the field 
develops, we anticipate that the institution will purchase a re-
cording machine of its own, freeing ours for pioneer work at another
place. Do you think there is a possibility of arranging for the
deposit of one of our machines, when it becomes available, with
an institution in Dallas where it could be used by you and others
in that area? Do you think that there is a possibility that an
institution there may be induced to purchase its own equipment if
we mutually cooperate by making one of our machines available
at the beginning of the program?

    That fool clipping from the New Yorker served one purpose
at least. A number of friends from whom I had not heard in some
time were able to locate me through it.

    With best wishes,

    Sincerely yours,
    Duncan Emrich
    Chief, Folklore Section
