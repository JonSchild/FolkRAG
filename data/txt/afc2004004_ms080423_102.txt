(Sh.) so proud as fair Ellender, who rise and bid him come in./
Oh!  What is this?  fair Ellender cried, what news do you bring to
me?/  I've come to invite you to my wedding day, will be sad news
for thee/  Oh Mother Oh Mother come riddle my sport(?) come riddle
it all in one/  must I go to Lord Thomas's wedding, or stay at
home and mourn?/  There may be thousands of your friends, but
thousands more of your foes/ and my advice would be for thee to
to carry this day at home./  There may be thousands of my friends,
and thousands more of my foes/ But if it's the last thing I'll do,
Lord Thomas's wedding I'll go/  She dressed herself in scarlet red
and wore a robe of green/  and every town that she rode thru,  they
took her to be a queen/  She rode up to Lord Thomas's gate, and
jingled at the ring/  and none was so proud as Lord Thomas himself,
to rise and let her come in/  He took her by the lily white hand
and led her across the hall/  He sat her down in a golden chair
among the ladies all./  Is this your bride, Lord Thomas, she cried,
I see that she is quite brown/  and you could have married the
fairest lady, that ever the sun shined on./  The brown girl had
a little pen knife, it was both clean and sharp/ betwixt the lung
(unint) she pierced fair Ellender's heart./  Oh what is wrong?
Lord thomas, he cried, What makes you turn so pale?/  you
used to be the fairest maiden that ever the sun shined on?/  Oh are
you blind, Lord Thomas? she cried, Or can you not very well see?/
Oh can't you see my own heart's blood come trickling down my knee?/
