to see in it a further piece of evidence
of the culture drift eastwards through
the Mediterranean and then northwards
from Spain along to the Atlantic seaboard.
Folk music seems to have been neglected by 
orthodox ethnologists and yet it 
is probably the most enduring (and
unchanging) culture feature of all.

Is there, I wonder, any likelihood
of the BBC ever making any of these
wonderful recordings available to the 
public? I personally would give a good
deal to posses that Irish recording I 
have mentioned. Would it be any good
suggesting a limited issue on a subscription
basis â€” an album of British Folk
music? It would be very much appreciated
by collectors.

Yours sincerely,
