Dearest Family,
The situation on the German Front is as follows. I have just finished, or will have finished tomorrow at my final exam, the entire first year course in German. Mrs. Dingus is offering by correspondence, since there are not enough people to make it a class, the whole second year of German to be six more weeks. However, since there are four people in Lubbock who want that second year course, she has offered to give us "conferences" which will amount practically to a class every other day for several hours. SMU, I notice only offeres the second half of second year German, the first is already over; and I have, as said before, entirely finished fisrt year German. A visit from some of my Bryn Mawr friends, of which more later, convinces me that I must do a lot more work if I want to pass the oral this fall-- they tell of sight passages in scientific German, etcetera which I just couldn't cope with now. So my conclusion is this: that I stay here for a few weeks/at least registering for this whole second year course by correspondence. If I find I can get along wi thout the conferences just as well, I'll come down to Dallas and can still keep the work up by real correspondence. However, if the conferences, rather classes, seem necessary to help me go as fast as I have to, I'll stay on out here till the second six weeks are up. Meanwhile, I will be listening to the Economics course out here and doing some reading which Miss Fairchild has recommended; she tells me that I will not necessarily need to take the course. With that, you see, I'll be able to move to
