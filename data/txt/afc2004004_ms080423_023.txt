Caz:  You take your bowls out, take your corn meal, or whatever
you're going to make it out of, cook that corn meal, heat the
water til it's boiling hard, put it in there and cook it good.
Let it set there til the next day. . . . . . . .cook it again.  And you
gotta sour mash.  And you put a little lump of sugar in, then
you put some more in, then wait 14 hours.  Then you gonna get

Ray:  Lead poising.  What they do, Alan, is they run it through

Caz:  Take this old. . . it's got zinc in it and make a pot out

make a long pipe, about 1 1/2 or 2 inches, and ten

Coil it around the stump, where you cut your tree off, just go
