Chapter V.

The earliest texts in the Child collection are ballads of the church and the Bible.  "Judas", 13th C. "Inter Diabolus et Virgo,"  ancestral riddling ballad, 15th C."St.  Stephen and Herod." 15th C.  "The Cranal and the Crane," carol  same manuscript.
These ecclesiastical pieces are in the couplet form, usually recognized as the older.  *
Thus ,  the ballad have been initiated or,  at least, very much stimulated in its development by a desire to popularize the Biblical tales and moralities --- the same desire that motivated so much medieval literature , the myst.  plays, carols, etc.. Like the drama, it passed out of the hands of the church into the hands of the people gradually forgotits origin, so much secualr material did it absorb.  "The ecclesiastics and the minstrels, between them, were responsible for all or nearly all the new types of medieval poetry and (possibly enough) for the ballad  , too." 168.
Then, there was not much liturgical dancing--  thus little connection between the church and dancing.
No earlier texts for ballad examination than the English 1th C. text. There could have been no lyrical rhyming ballad poetry in England before the the 11th Century and the Norman conquest and it would not be plausible that the common people--  that is, the Anglo-Saxons  , invented it before their masters, the Normans.  They were more likely to have stuck to the old alliterative forms.

The carols (bit wthy, carnal and crane, cherry tree craol, , the holy well) which are very early, deserve to be called ballads as well as carols. " The lyric  art, it is hardly too much to say, was in England kept alive for nearly three centuries by the hymns of the monks and lay brothers."  (Rhys, Lyric Poetry  , 1913) The earliest approaches to the song manner of ballads which remain to us are eccleiastical. (174)
