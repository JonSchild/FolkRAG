reader may get an insight into the character of this [a] Negro [zzzx]
folk-artist.

[In analysis this story][The whole is a tissue of lies and inaccuracies] [that has not, however, in the large they felt of truth] We cannot even
be sure how old Lead Belly is, just as, probably, he, himself, is
not sure. [Why, indeed, should he care how old he is? He is in the prime
of life, never ill, attractive to women, in good voice, and
his fingers are now more than ever nimble on the guitar.] The sum of
the years he claims to have spent in different places comes to
fifty-eight, but on [his] the day of his marriage at Wilton he suddenly
announced that it was his birthday and that he was forty-six
years old. Finally, according to the prison records he was forty years old
on his release from the Texas Penetentiary in 1925. That makes
him fifty at this present writing and pretty well splits the difference between
his other stories. [We'll say, then, that he was born in
[xxx] 1885.]

Hudie Ledbetter then was born in 1885 [xxx]somewhere
[xxxxxx] not far from Caddo Lake near the Texas-Louisiana line on the Texas side. [xxx] The nearest town was [xxx]
Mooringsport, Louisiana. Thirty miles south[west]east on the Kansas City
Southern Railway was Shreveport, Louisiana, a big sprawling Southern City, [the center]
[xxx] where river streamers still loaded [cotton the] cotton
and [cane] sugar from the Red River bottom platations. [now an oil shipping
center, now Louisiana's second largest city.] Thirty miles [xxx]
west, at the end of Caddo lake was Jefferson, [Texas] one of the
oldest of Texas [xxx] towns, [xxx] in the early days a port
[xxx] bustling with the settlers who were pouring] into the new land.
[xxx plantation plantation country of East, Texas]]
Forty miles to the southwest was Marshall, Texas, county seat
of Harrison County, in those days a sleepy country town, now
mushroomed in the oil boom.
