-lonesome in her mind-
-
Young people leaving by train-
the old women trying to follow
the train - howling & struggling,
losing their children forever .
-
Kidnapping mermaid - horseback - 9th
wave cuts horse in to - years later mermaid
finds her covering- & leaves children weeping
behind.
-
4 men fight till tide came out & liked
to drown till the priest drove
them asunder - man with finger
bitten thru - postman had own board
not broken over his head = all 
because porter from east & west didn't
agree & the people went raging at 
the fall of the night ..
