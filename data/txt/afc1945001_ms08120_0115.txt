The Same to You

Once a commanding officer
was showing a friend around a
camp. Everytime a "Rookie" would
pass and sulute him, he would
return the sulute and say in a
whisper under his breath, "The
same to you." Several times he
did that and his friend became
curious and said "Sir, why do
you say "the same to you" every
time a "Rookie" sulutes you?" The
commanding officer replied: "Well,
you see I was once a "Rookie"
myself, and everytime I suluted
an officer I would tell him what
I thought of him, under my breath.
Now when I sulute a "Rookie" I know
he is doing the same to me as I did
to my superior officers and I return
his insult with "The same to
you."
