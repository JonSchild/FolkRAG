[Mr. Lewis Torrent]
[Mr. Paddy Miles]
[Mr.Bill Duchaine]:

Some time ago, I wrote my good friend, Dr. Beck, of Mount Pleasant, Michigan, asking for his material on old-time lumberjacks in Michigan--character sketches, biographies, autobiographies, descriptive material, anecdotes. He gave me your name and said that you might have such material and would be willing to lend it to me for the purpose of my study. Another I would like to know, is the story of the origin of the Little Brown Bull chances or lumberjack ballad. I am also particularly interested in knowing what songs were popular among the lumberjacks in Michigan. How, when, and where they were sung. The Library of Congress is making a collection of lumberjack songs and I would appreciate your cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
