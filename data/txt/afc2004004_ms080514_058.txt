And ah, he was there for 45 years, and he got
black lung.  He said, you know, black lung is
- you see, you see this piece of dark in my
arm?  He says:  that's coal there, and it'll be
there until I die.  He says I've got that in
my lungs, and I'll have it till I die.  But
he says ah:  I didn't just lie down with it,
I exercised my lungs.  I sang, and I did
special things, and so it hadn't gotten me,
and here I am at 80 and I'm just as good as
I ever was.  And he is.  He - Nimrod never - 
he's hardly ever at home.  He's out speaking,
he's out singing, he's out telling his
story to the world, as he tells it to us now. 

That's too enthusiastic, isn't it.
