Eliz: Did you all meet at the church, Mrs. D?

Rev. D: Naw I'll tell you where that thing got started. I used to go into Raleigh, you understand -- well yo tell you troof bout it (some people won't tell the truth on theirsef) I met her there with some of my friends. They was very, very rough, you understand. Drinkin crowd of people. An yet I would go there. The people would treat me nice. She said to me one day, said, "Rev. Davis, if you would like I can give you a place to stay." I say, "Well reason I didn't say nothin to you bout gittin no place is cause I'll be out late workin." She say, "Well I don't min gittin up." One word led to another. So I first started roomin there. Hadn't said anything in the line of coteship.
