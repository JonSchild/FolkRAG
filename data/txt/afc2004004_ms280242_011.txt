for the rest of your life."
"God bless my soul," he says. "Twenty years ago."
     It happened down in the town of Portnockie, playing. So
he went home to the camp. And the children didn't know him, you
see. . .And they're still living to this present day, and the
story ends, and I hope you liked it.
Anne: I loved it.
Lomax: What's the name of the man this happened to?
Davy: Johnny McPhee.
Lomax: And he's still alive?
Davy: Well, he's not alive. That's how the story goes. But
