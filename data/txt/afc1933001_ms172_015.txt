MEMORANDUM

FROM                                                               TO THE CHIEF OF THE
Archive of Amer. Folksong DIVISION             Music DIVISION
July 17, 1941
Attached is a cordial acceptance from Mr. Vance 
Randolph of our proposed collaborative recording 
project.  This is the most important project which 
the Archive has immediately in prospect and I feel 
that it is very important that Mr. Randolph begin 
work this summer when the weather is good and the 
roads are still passable.
The recording truck can take the machine to 
Tennessee; Mr. Randolph can come to meet us there 
for a few days' instruction in the operation of 
the portable equipment.
Appended is an estimate approved by Mr. Weisner of 
the cost of this recoding project which will give 
the Archive the most possible authentic picture of 
folk-music in the Ozarks.
