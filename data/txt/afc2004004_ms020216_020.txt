BJ TAPE 3, p 18

An' then you understand what you doin'.  The chirruns understan'.

AL:    Well, there's another difference along that line.  And that
 is, in the Baptist Church, it's always the men -- almost always
-- the men that do all the talking and teaching.  Isn't that 
right.

BJ:    I know.  Um-hum, um-hum.  That's right.  Yeah.

AL:    Whereas in your Holiness Church, it can be anybody.

BJ:    Well, ah, they, they can hear him.  I mean they can, they can read
behind him.  The preacher, he preaches.  Of co'se you know that.
An on the church, the preacher preaches.  It's his time to

a Scripture."  You know?  Such-and-such a Scripture in the 
Bible.  Those come together.  You see?  And, and, you, you study
the Bible.  That where you learn of God.  See, an' schoolin' of 
God an' then you learn by it.  An' some folks will say, "Oh,
you jump all over the Bible!"  That's way you're supposed to do.
Hit's written from Genesis, Revelation, you see?  An you supposed
to know it.  That's what the reference down in the, in the mittle
(sic) there for.  You see, you read a word an' you don't know
