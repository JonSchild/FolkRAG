July 9, 1935

Mr. John A. Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear. Mr. Lomax:

Replying at length to your long letter of June 16, I should
say, first, that I have had marked copies of last year's report
sent to all the folk-song people on your list; second, that I 
have passed on your news about the machine to the Librarian, who
is writing to you approving the exchange; third, that Professor
Herzog has returned the five Leadbelly records he borrowed, together
with twenty-six others, new to use, which we are adding to 
the collection, bringing the total number of Archive records to
657 (280 Lomax, 355 Victor, 22 Thomas).

May I ask you to send me before long your copy for the 1935
report? In the meantime I send you a supply of Archive letter 
paper. "Early Songs of Uncle Sam" should be in any day now and
will go forward to you as soon as received.

News bulletin: Father is in Hollywood for the summer, where 
he is "Consultant" for Metro-Goldwyn's Romeo and Juliet. Mother
will be here with us until about August 1. Mrs. Strunk and I sail
for Europe August 13. Do we see you and Alan before that? 

Faithfully,

Chief, Division of Music
