NEGRO SPIRITUALS 1934
    Iron Head looked at Clear Rock and Clear Rock shuffled in his seat
and said glibbly, "Suttingly, Suttingly." But Iron Head went on re-
morselessly: "That's whut the matter with us niggers. Just about the
time we gets down to whut you might call logic some nigger like you
jumps up an' talks, an' talks until everybody gets los' an' dunno
where he is at. Dese two white mens want songs that us niggers has
made up, what we call jumped-up songs, an' you keeps on throwin' in
stuff that youse heard on the records. Don't you think they knows whut
they wants?"
    "Youse right, Iron Head, you is right," Clear Rock answered with
a sweeping gesture of his ham-like hand. "You is my buddy, Iron Head,
an' you is always right."
    Again Iron Head fixed Clear Rock with a level gaze of quiet scorn
and then said to his two white visitors: "I'se thought up another song
about de Brown Girl. I'll sing it fur you ef you want to hear it,"
And the interview interrupted now and then by clashes between the two
blacks, went on its long and leisurely way.
    Both convicts had volunteered to their visitors that they were
"habituals," life prisoners, legal social outcasts condemned to per-
petual servitude. One had lived for forty-seven years in the Texas
penitentiary, the first sentence for murder. The other had "been in
de pen off an' on for twenty-three years," for crimes as serious. In
his own words: "I was de roughest nigger who ever walked de streets
of Dallas."
   "I got a letter dat my woman wuz dyin',
    She wusn't dead, but she wus slowly dyin'.
    I couldn't go but I see 'em let her down,
    An' den I hear dat lonesome coffin-sound."
