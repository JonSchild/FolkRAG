reader would be of help to me. Set 
'em out if you can find the 
time. If not, forget the request
and do your job. After all, 
it's my book and my work,
not yours. I'm speaking my 
mind regardless of the Library
of Congress, the New Deal or what 
not. Probably it's my last opportunity.
I know your suggestion 
would help me.

For a week the snow and ice
make it impossible to drive to 
town. Dallas has not seen such 
continued cold for many years.
I hope to start next week on 
a recording trip. I'm including in 
the records a bit of my own 
singing, requested expressly by Dr. 
Spivacke. 
Lovingly,
Father.
