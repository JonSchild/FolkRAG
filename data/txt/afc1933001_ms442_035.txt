The Story:

And here follows the story of the "worldly nigger" so 
far as we have been able to reconstruct it from his own 
reluctant, contradictory and intentionally confusing statements, 
from prison records, from 
a few scattering, brief and uninterested letters [from]
written by white men who have known him, and from the recollections
of two of his women - Margaret, his childhood sweetheart,
[by whom he had his only child, who lives now in
Dallas]  - and Martha, his present wife. [whom we brought East and 
saw him legally marry]. Some of the most interesting and significant 
stories we have had to omit because [of the bad impression 
they would make all around.] of their complete
unprintableness. Some of the tales are told in his
own idiom with as close an approximation to his narrative style as
we could recontruct. * There is certainly an over-emphasis
of the violent and criminal side of 
Lead Belly's life, and that because we had
[*l.c.*] some basis (in his criminal record) for our questions. Therefore, we present
this loosely woven texture of recontructed stories and
letters, not as accurate biographical material, but as 
a set of dramatic tales through which the

* Since neither of us could write shorthand, we soon despaired
of taking notes on his stories as he told them. In
writing long-hand we lost some [portions] of each tale in 
attempting accuracy of [the] idiom [of others]. Besides, Lead Belly
soon became embarrassed and unnatural when he saw us taking notes. We, therefore, wrote down
the stories complete directly after he had told them.
