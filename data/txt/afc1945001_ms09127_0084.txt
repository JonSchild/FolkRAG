Jokes 

A soldier who had been wounded 
in battle came home on a furlough
to rest.  Everyone made a fuss over
him, then he saw the fellow who
had stolen his girl while he was
away.  "Just like a custard pie," 
he mused.  "Yellow all through
and not enough crust to go over the 
top." 

An old timer, with World War service, 
had a yen to get back into uniform and
go to sea again.  He looked up a Navy
recruiting station and offered his
services.  On entering he was directed
to a newly-minted ensign, who 
began to question him. 
"What was your service in the
last war?" asked the ensign. "I 
served in the turret crew on the
Arizona," replied the old salt. 
"Well I suppose you realize that
things are a lot different now," commented
the officer.     [*Folder 127*]
