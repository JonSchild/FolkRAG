THE EARLY SONGS OF UNCLE SAM, By GEORGE STUYVESANT JACKSON.
PUBLISHED AT $5.00 - OUR PRICE $3.50

Of the small edition published a few copies still remain, and
those wishing to procure them are advised to order promptly.

This book is a collection of songs popular in the United States
One Hundred Years ago, and as such, it furnishes a most
illuminating picture of the life of those times.

The current ditties of the days when people did a lot of singing
around the fireside, or at political rallies, are here
included, and to-day's reader will discover from them more
about the character of his forebears than he can glean from
the impersonal pages of a history book.

The book is an octavo of 297pp., set in Caslon Old Style and
printed to Flemish Laid Paper. Edition limited to 1000 copies.
