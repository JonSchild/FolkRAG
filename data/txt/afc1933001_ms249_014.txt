We've put the energetic and dynamic
Pat in school. Susan plays
around with Deanie and John
Alan quietly, making trouble for
no one. She reminds me of
the very young Bess Brown
in her quite submission to
the things that are, her ability
to fit into any scheme of 
things without frustration.

We haven't heard from
Shirley since she drove away
to see Chris a week ago, nor
from Bess since Feb'y 1, ecept
for one letter a month ago. I
thank you for your news about
her which is somewhat indefinite.
If she has no income, I'd like
to know it, but at the same time
