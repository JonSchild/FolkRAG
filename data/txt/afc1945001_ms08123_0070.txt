   you can believe it or not, but the
story is going around that a detail of eight
enlisted men was assigned to move the
post library at Camp Davis, North Carolina.
   The men carried out the assignment, but
left one book.
   Its title was:  "You Can't Take it With
You."

   With America's plane factories working
at top speed, the story is told that at one
of them they  built a plane in a dozen
hours.  Five minutes later a pilot took
off in it, and six hours later he cabled:
"Am in Australia.  Please send motor."
