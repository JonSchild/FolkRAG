excerpt from letter dated April 23rd, from Archibald 
Macleish to Joris Ivens.



"As to the matter you wrote me about on April 
4, I have since talked to Marshall and to Dr. 
Stevens about Library matters but neither of them 
referred to the project you and Losey discussed 
with me. Since the Library's relation to that 
undertaking was to be, if anything, a sponsorship 
relation, I hardly feel I should be the first 
mover. However, if anything comes up, I'd be 
very much interested to hear about it, as you know."
