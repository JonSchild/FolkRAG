Dear John Lomax:

Thank you for forwarding to us the texts of 
songs sent you for Mrs.  J. C. Marshall.  We will add
them to the file of material here.  I have not, I
believe, thanked you for your generosity in putting
me up when I was in Dallas or for guiding me around
the University and City.  I enjoyed my stay greatly.
I have not heard, however, from Southern Methodist
and wonder if they sight not be jogged by you into
requesting in writing blank records and equipment, if
needed.  I hope that they may be able to find local
equipment.  If not, I believe we can arrange it.

The collecting project with Radio House at 
University of Texas goes on well and when you are in 
Austin, Mr. Rishworth, the Director, will be delighted
to have you call on him.

I understand that your new book of ballads will
be out this Fall and I wish you every success.  The
one Charles and I doing will not appear, probably,
until late in the Spring so there should be no
competition between the two.  Also, ours does not have
arranged accompaniments.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,


Duncan Emrich
