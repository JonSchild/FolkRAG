that I tole you while ago.  Yo u either wait till thet chile asleep
     (How can you be sure it's asleep?)
     At that age, you understand, you know what to put to
a chile to make sure it's asleep.  Feed it wid some kina strong
tea, sometime give it two drops of paragoric, you understan.
When yo u know that chile ought to be asleep.
     (Will paragoric make a child go to sleep?)
     Yeah, if it's sposed to be sleep.  You keep that chile
awake all day long.  It bound to sleep.  Can't stay wake so much.
     (You think it's bad for children to know what their
parents are doing?)

they'll be tryin to do that same thing and don't even know the
sense and knowledge of it.  They'll come up to be jes like a dog.
Can you train a dog ho w to guide his nature?  Well then.
     (In teaching children about love making, do you think
you should tell them it's sinful and dirty?)
     NO.  NO.  NO.
     (Do you think some people do tell their children
that?)
     Thass a low-down mothah too, do that.  They should be
taught all right, but they should wait fur the time.  The Scripture
say there's a t ime to all things.  See, after a chile git twelve
yeahs ole, it's got grown people's knowledge.  Able to keep things.
Try em on some little things that won't hurt much.  Say, "Now don't
you tell that."  An if that chile tell that, you be sure to whup
that chile fur tellin that thang.  Or either give it a good scoldin.
Then a chile will learn to keep the next thing that you let it
kn ow.  Then when it git twelve years ole, you can set down an  tell
