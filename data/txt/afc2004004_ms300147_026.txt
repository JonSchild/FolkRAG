Dear Rev. Crenshaw,

By a stroke of good fortune, Atlantic Records has decided 
to become interested in the tapes I recorded round the South. 
I am doing a series of lps for them covering various aspects of 
Southern folk songs. Among these will be an lp on the spirituals 
of the Negro people. And on this lp, along with numerous other 
selections, I would like to include several of the numbers I 
recorded in your church.

A letter of contract is attached, under whose terms I 
will be able to pay you a modest cash advance per song used--
and I will not be sure how many Atlatic will chose till the end 
of this month--as well as a normal royalty plus an arranger's 
royalty. I am sure you will be pleased at the notice this recording 
will get for you and your church, and also at the fine style 
of the publication. 

Please sign and return two of the attached letters of 
contract as soon as possible, and by the first week of January 
I will be able to send you the advance payment. The record will be 
out by March and a copy will be sent you.

I hope to return South and see you again this spring.

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax
