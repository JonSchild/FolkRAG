3A        Collector Man Blues, sung and played on piano by Walter
             Roland                                                                        PE  0293

B           Things about Comin' My Way, sung and played on guitar by
              Tampa Red and Georgia Tom                                VO  1637

All theses are blues records, and they are absolutely of the 
first quality. Nothing better has been or ever will be recorded
in the line of folk blues. They are poetically strong and musical-
ly exciting. The next three records consist of spirituals performed 
with guitar accompaniment.

4A        Dark was the Night, sung and played on guitar by Blind
             Willie Johnson

B           Just Can't Keep from Cryin'

5A         Motherless Children, Blind Willie Johnson with guitar

B           Keep your Lamp Trimmed and Burning
                                                                                                 CO  4425 D

6A         I Am the True Vine, sung by                             Gary
                                                                                                   PE 5-12-66

B            I'll be Rested When the Roll is Called, Blind Roosevelt
               Graves and his Brother                                PE  6-11-74
                                                                             Master no.  HAT 11 S

In publishing this album there should be an accompanying
leaflet containing material about the life of Blind Willie
Johnson and that of Robert Johnson, notes about the songs, and
the full texts of the records. I wish you'd let me know how you
feel about this sometime soon.

With very best regards and best wishes for a merry Christmas, Iam

Sincerely yours,
