8) O daughter dear, I read your dream,
I think it will prove sorrow.
For your true love John lies pale and wan
On the dowie dans of Yarrow.
9) As she walked up yon high, high hill,
And doon by the hills of Yarrow,
There she saw her lover John
Lying pale and wan on Yarrow.
10) Her hair it being three-quarters lang,
The color it was yellow,
She wrapped it round his middle sae small
And bore him down frae Yarrow.
11) O father dear, ye've seven sons,
Ye may wed them all tomorrow.
For the fairest flo'or among them all
Was the lad I lo'ed on Yarrow.
12) This fair said being big with child,
A think which did cause sorrow,
She laid dead in her lover's arms
Betwixt that day and the morrow.

Collier Laddie:
1) I've travelled East and I've travelled West
And I hae been to Kircadlie.
And the fairest maid I every spied
Was following a collier laddie.
Laddie, o laddie,
And the fairest maid that e'er I spied,
Was following a collier laddie.
2) O see ye not yon hills and dales
The sun shines on sae brawly?
They all are mine and they shall be thine
Gin ye leave your collier laddie.
3) O would you fancy one that's black
And you sae fair and gowdy?
Or fancy yin o' high degree
Than following a collier laddie?
4) Her father dear then vowed and swear,
"Through he be black, he's bonny.
She's mair delight in him. I fear,
Than you wi' all your money.
