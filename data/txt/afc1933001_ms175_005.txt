Dear Sterling: 
Attached is one of the results 
of our evening of Negro music at the 
Library. Father was infuriated by 
your story about Bessie Smith, and said 
that he believed he could prove it was
untrue. Enclosed are the documents he 
has collected for his side of the story. 
I thought you would be interested. I 
hope you can bring them in personally 
when you come to see me next week. I 
am looking forward to it a great deal. 
Kindest regards, 
Alan
