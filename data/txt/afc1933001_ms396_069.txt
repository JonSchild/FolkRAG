of its striped body. The coon did not stop at the water's edge.
Instead he waded out and began to swim quietly away as if headed for
the other side. Meanwhile, the dogs appeared, six flop-eared, brown 
with black, hounds, hurrying and howling to the kill. They rushed down 
the bank baying furiously; then suddenly stopped. For the coon had 
swum for twenty feet out into the river, then had turned and, while 
treading water, was quietly facing his foes. 
The dogs lined up along the steam with their feet out in the 
water, baying furiously. Brother Coon didn't bat an eye. He waited. 
One of the younger hounds plunged and swam for the enemy. The coon 
seemed to steady himself, his eyes shining and his lips drawn back in 
an angry smile. When the dog's head, held low in the water, seemed 
only inches away, the coon leaped clear of the water and landed squarely 
on top of his enemy's head. As they both went out of sight his coonship 
was digging in with mouth and claws. They stayed under for a long time. 
I thought both might be drowned. The coon came up first, swimming easily. 
The dog was barely able to reach shore, threshing wildly out of the 
water with his front feet. As he came in he met another dog swimming out. 
Incidents, ditto, another half-drowned dog, still another to the rescue, 
and so on and on until six gasping and tousled hounds lay along the sandy 
beach with every mite of fight taken out of them. The coon, master of the 
situation, and unhurried, swam in, trolled past them, leaped on the prone 
sapling again, ran past me at arm's length, his soft pads plumping against 
the wood. In a moment he had disappeared in the underbrush.
