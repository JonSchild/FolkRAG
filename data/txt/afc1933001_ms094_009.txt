    Finally, for God's sake, John, don't think that because in
one or two places I urged cutting down time that I thought you
"bungled" the affair. I can't keep from getting fidgety and
unhappy when people on the program exceed their time, taking it
away from others obliged to follow them.

    Don't fail to express appreciation to Mrs. Lomax. Get that
old cowpuncher's reminiscences in shape to publish. We'll
publish it some time. Hoping you are feeling like taking a
peep at the blue dome, I remain

    Your friend, 
    Frank Dobie

    P. S. It was Mrs. Randall who very earnestly requested me
to get hold of the chair at the end so that she could make a
motion expressing our appreciation to you. You probably have not
had a letter from her!!! She's your friend all right.

    Check will go to you from Folklore office to cover telephone
calls. So far, we have had no bill on program printing. We are
prepared to pay for them.
