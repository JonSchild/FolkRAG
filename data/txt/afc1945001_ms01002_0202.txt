Re: Rumor Funneling through Gosnell

The OPA field inspectors can collect rumors
for OFF. (Assuming that Frank Bane authorizes the project.)

The individual inspectors should be asked to 
record each rumor that they hear. They should attempt to 
reproduce the language that was used by the person telling
the rumor. They should also record certain facts about the
person from whom the rumor is heard.

We should not depend on the individual
inspectors to evaluate the rumors as to intensity of
belief or prevalence. This should come as a result of
a compilation of all the individual reports. Gosnell will
probably do some work in this connection and the Special
Service Division, after relating the OPA material to its
other rumor indices, will make an overall evaluation.

Naturally, a letter of instructions to the
field inspectors is necessary. Gosnell should draft this
but it much be submitted to OFF for approval.   [*let's write it for him.*]

It is important that these rumor gatherers
only collect spontaneous material. They must not ask for
rumors or they will wind up by acting as rumor-inciters
and making people rumor conscious in an undesirable way
(quite the opposite of the type of rumor-consciousness
OFF hopes to instill through its rumor-counteraction
techniques). Not least of the problems that [this] [*Gosnell's*] letter
must deal with are the definition of a rumor and the
instructing of the inspectors as to how rumors may be
recognized. [as such.] [?]

The less judgement that we require of the
inspectors, the more accurate will be the results. The
following form was drawn with this in mind. Later,
elaboration may be indicated.
