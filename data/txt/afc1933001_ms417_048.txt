[Quickly] Cotton Mill Collect

          F
When you buy clothes on ea-sy terms
                                                               C           F
An' col-lect-or treats you like a meas-ly worm,
       B                                       F
One dol-lar down and then lord knows
                    G7                                               C7
If you don't make a pay-ment they'll take your clothes.

When you go to bed you can't sleep,
                                                    C                 F
You owe so much at the end of the week. 
     B                                          F
No use to col-lect, they're all that way,
         G7                                              C7
Can't get the mon-ey and they move a-way,
        F
I'm a goin' to stareve, Every-bod-y will,
                                               C7          F
Can't make a liv-in' at a cot-ton mill.
