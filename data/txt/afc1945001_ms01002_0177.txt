Letter from China, signed by Loretta Bachmann

The attached letter from Shanghai, China, signed by
one Loretta Bachmann and written to the attorney for the Kansas
City Southern Railway Company, exemplifies many which are being
written from Japanese-occupied China, ostensibly by Chinese or
Anglo-American residents there. I saw a similar letter, written
to Dr. Peter Odegard of the Amherst College faculty.

The Odegard letter purported to be from a pro-American
Chinese student whose father had traveled in the United States.
The letter said that China's No. 1 enemy was Communism, that
the writer could not understand good American money being spent
on materials of war to aid Russia, Chian's No. 1 enemy.

It is reasonably safe to assume that a direct-by-mail
campaign is being launched by the Japanese, similar to the one
that was launched by the Germans on lawyers, university professors
 and businessmen earlier in the war.

Since these letters are obviously aimed at professional
groups, who the Japanese intend shall be opinion-formers for
them, it would be a good idea to secure some publicity in the 
daily newspapers of the United States about this direct-by-mail
campaign to negate it before the seeds of confusion which it
hopes to spread can take root.

If you agree and will return this letter to me, I will
draw up a memorandum to Mr. Lewis on this subject.
