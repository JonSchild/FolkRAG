                   War Rumors
       One of the rumors I have
recently heard was that Germany's
beloved dictator was critically ill.
I had no sooner rejoced at the
little bit of information when a 
famous news comentator began
to explain about Hitlers plans
against Russia. I waited ever
so patiently to hear him say
something about Hitlers illness but
unfortunatly he had said nothing
what so ever about Hitler's
physical condition. I came
to the conclusion that the
information I had heard was
just one of those war rumors.
