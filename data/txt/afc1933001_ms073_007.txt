Mr. John A. Lomax

Dear Mr. Lomax:
                   I am wondering how you are making out with THE ADVENTURES OF A
BALLAD HUNTER. I am just back from vacation and I find that no answer has
come in to my letter of July 13th. As I wrote you then, I liked very much
the few pages you sent, but I got the impressions from them that the book
as you conceived it might be purely an anecdotal one. I hope I am wrong, 
but I should like to know for my peace of mind just what your general outline
is. 
                   I hope nothing has held up your work on it and that all 
goes well with you
                                                                           Sincerely yours, 
                                                                            
                                                                           Assistant to the President
