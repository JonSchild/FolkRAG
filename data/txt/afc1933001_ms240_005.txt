Dear Father:

I just got back day before yesterday, after visits at the University of Louisana, Fiske University N.C., and with your delightful Ruby Pickins Tart. She is all you have limmed her and has a wonderful tempestous temperament. We seem to have some recording money to spend next year, and when I am sure just what, and a little more straight about it, I well send you an outline of the whole thing. Enclosed are a number of letters which concern you, and a few more of the dictaphone texts which I found in my papers.


Elizabeth and I both enjoying very much seeing all of you in Beaumont and Galveston. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

With much love to all of you.

 Alan Lomax
