July [28]29th - Spent the morning & afternoon
listening to George Adams (89) & Mr.
McClellan (75) discuss old & bloody times in 
the Delta. Had no blank records left & so
wrote furiously [a] in my notebooks.
Late in the evening called on Muddy 
Waters & made a formal interview.
At 9 I sat in the front parlor
of Charley Idaho, one of the "mister Charlies" of 
the levee hollers. A stern man , iron willed,
puritan, coldly righteous - "never crippled
a nigger in his life" He told me much 
of early levee building days.
July 30th The children assembled by the Country
Ag. High School knew the names of the games
and some of the dance steps, but few of the
songs. All knew "Sally Walker" Drop the
Handkerchief" - some knew "Pullin' the Shiff," "Satify".
Their teachers, however, knew them all. I
recorded the teachers. Drover over and got Morganfield
and a couple of friends. made more
records and then dashed to catch the
three o'clock train for Memphis, I 
was out of records. I had no film. My
rt front tire was in the shop for vulcanizing
