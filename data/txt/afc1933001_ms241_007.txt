A day or two ago I pulled from 
the book-case Johnny's copy of 
Rupert Brooke's poems. Inside the 
cover I found the enclosed letter, 
addressed to you. You know 
I read it, so I deserved the 
slam on the nose I got at the 
end. I guess there never lived
a smarter and more coolly calculating 
she-devil in all the 
universe. My only surmise 
about the letter's location is 
that you must once have
borrowed Johnny's book. That
and the rest I leave up 
to you.
I'd like to hear
about anything you can do
