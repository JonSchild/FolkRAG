Johnny is due here today.  Shirley
will be by later.  It's fine to
see my children and to know
that those who are away are busy
and happy on their jobs.

   May I suggest again that with your
surplus money that you pay
off every debt that you owe?
You'll make a devastating mistake
if you allow your expenses
to increase in the same ratio
of the increase of your income.
You may put me off last, though
I need the money for many things
that are coming up necessary to
a shining home for you to 
re-visit.

   I'm tuning in for you again
this afternoon.   Your stuff comes
over at eleven and plainly as if
you were in the next room

Lovingly,   Father
