MEMORANDUM

To:            R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director
From:       Cornelius DuBois, Executive Assistant 
Re:            Rumor Clinics

I talked on Monday evening to Chester Williams. He
agreed to take out of his Rumor Clinic outline any
mention of work to be done independently in the colleges.

I also talked to Mr. Potter of COI who is as horrified
as we were to learn that this kind of action
was included when it had been specifically excluded
in our original conversation.

I have now received the revised draft of the Rumor 
Clinic outline which leaves out much of the work
to be done in colleges which doesn't specifically
guard against this danger.
