"I remembers one time when I couldn't even leave this place. Well
it come about once when I was cropping here and was doing pretty
good. Had me three head of mules and most near the makings of bout 
fifty bales of cotton in the field. I was driving my car across
the lot. An agent there come over and up and tell me that I looks
like I'm trying to run over him. He kept on talking about a little
old nigger getting to buy a car. And he shoved me through the
window of m car, and kept cursing. Man, I didn't way a word, just 
reach down by the seat the care getting that old 32-20 of mine.
My cousin who was sitting there by me, started yelling, "Oh Lordy,
oh Lordy! Please don't." That white man got so scaired he ran.
The news that a nigger had run a white man with a gun just spread
like hell, and I started figuring I had better get out. That night
the old man over the plantation came up and told me that I better
not think of getting away because no nigger had better not be
thinking he could do nothing and get away. Told me to stop telling
other folks that I pulled a gun on a white man. He told me also
that if any Negroes asked me about it, "tell them that it was a lie."
This change in attitude is also observed in other areas of
activities. The following incident is indicative of a departure
from the traditional pattern of race relations on the plantation:
a white agent yelled up to a Negro on the cotton wagon, "Come on
boy - spruce 'em up. You ain't doing a damn thing. Looks like I
got to come up there and beat your ass 'fore you going to do anything."
The Negro answered, with a slightly emphatic drawl,
"Listen here white man, you got that wrong. You ain't going to
beat nobody."
