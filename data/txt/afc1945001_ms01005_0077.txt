                                                         4.

                 not because the rumor serves either (a) to explain the
                 tension, or (b) to justify the prejudice?

                 People tend to explain and to justify; then if they are
                 not successful, they change their minds about the whole
                 thing, sometimes giving up their prejudices. This
                 psychodynamic analysis needs to be given in order to 
                 point out methods and policies for rumor control.

                 The question is what's being done about it? The
                 interviewers should have been watching for counter-active
                 influences, and should have been encouraged to
                 include policy suggestions.

Page 23.  Rumor denial. Here is the only paragraph devoted to 
                 rumor control. It is inadequate. How do we know
                 that education and authoritative denials are not effective?
                 People can be taught the mechanisms of "scapegoating."
                 People can also be shamed into not spreading rumors.
                 Other method of rumor control should have been studied 
                 and evaluated.

Page 24.  The scope of future studies. I recommend that none
                 be made unless tied to the question of rumor control.

Table 8.   It is here that the question arises whether the measure
                of prejudice was independent of the measure of rumor
                frequency.

Table 14.  It is important to know whether people were asked
                  if they believed these rumors, or whether the interviewer
                 estimated the degree of belief.
