Never smacked my children.
Bin knocked about so bloody
much when I was a child
That I [didn't] swore if I 
ever had child I'd never
touch them. One day she
smacked Jack - he didn
want to wear the new Sunday
hat she'd bot him. Have
I told you if you ever
hit one again, you and
[I] will never be friends again
And so she never hit one of
them again. Course I cussed
them - cussed them terrible - 
(he laughs hugely)
