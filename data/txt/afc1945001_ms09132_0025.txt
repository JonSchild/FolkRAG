1. I am a Negro democracy's step-child, what do I 
have to fight. 

2. Once I heard a discussion on a lynching that 
took place sometime ago. In the particular situation

and the fetus was cut from her stomach. One
in the conversation remarked " and they call it democracy."

3. To kill a Jap I'd be a sap,
