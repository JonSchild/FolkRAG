BJ TAPE 12, P. 10

That it don't worry me 'cause it been my age; it ain't never
worried me too much. In my whole life. I mean, that's why I
didn't know I's pregnant when, when I was pregnant, Hah, hah, 
hah, hah. If I -- I tell ya how I am about that, the whole truth: 
If I -- I'm 'bout that jus', jus' like gettin' out here an' goin' downtown,
see? If I don't go, I sits here all day long an' enjoy
myself, see. If I [just] gits starts walkin', I don't care if I walk a
mile. So that's jest the way it is! That's just honest;
that's jest the way it is. I'm just like a mule; I'm not goin' 'till
I git started, ha, ha, ha, ha! So that's just the way it is.
And I don't -- don't worry me at all. Tha's all. Well, tha's true.
AL: So when your daughter started goin' out with boys, that
didn't bother you?
BJ: No, that didn' bother me a bit. Jus' [so's] since I kn[e]ow she was --  ah, I
wanted to know that she was with somebody that was, you know, 
wouldn't be fightin' an' raisin' sand an' carry her to no bad
place. Tha's right.
You know, when I quit goin' to dance in Miami -- ah, it's
the funniest about that -- ah, my daughter was there, ya know.
An' I done got 'er from up there, an' I wanted to go dance. Like
I had been goin' around, there, ya know, dancin'. So an' enjoyin' myse'f.
So, I don't, none, nohow, I never was a woman that want my
child to know nothin' 'bout me. See? An' that's true. That's 
up until today, nobody. My mother an' my chil' it's n-none 
they business 'bout what's goin' on with me. An' so I didn't want
them to know nothin' that I thought that, ya know, was wrong, like...
An' always was against a woman dancin' around, you know, doin'
things before her children, that she shouldn't do.
