The highlands

The crash + shrieks of the wind in
the glens in winter.  Turn the silence of the
day after when every [?mannad] [?waves turquoise]
The Atlantic is never still.

Hills beachs about steel grey loch.

Highland [*tu*] habit of lying - encouraging
the stranger on [*him*] his journey - letting him
down easy - hospitality -

[?Druid] going about like a roaring lion

Older man talking about highland valor -
Says when reproached, "I do not
think it amiss to invoke the almighty's
name on a great occasion."

The nature of a hen, a sow a woman - to
have their own way.

Going to rain is silent work -

[?Faith] says I know very little
of their dialect but I know
they're lazy filthy -
