THE FRENCHMAN'S BALL

I have two sons and a son-in-law
Fighting in the wars in America
I have two sons and a son-in-law
Fighting in the wars in America.
But I don't know if I see them more
Or whether I'll visit old Ireland's shore,
To the rum-die-ah, fa-da-didde-ah;
Whacks to the lady to the rum-die-ah.

My son Terry is nice and trim,
To every leg he has one shin, (2)
I spied two ships a-comin' on the sea,
"Halilloo, Bubilloo, an' I think 'tis you,"
Refrain.

"O ships, O ships, will you wait a while,
Till I find Terry, my own child(2)"
He's mama's pet and darling boy,
He's the ladies' t'y* and the girls own joy,
Refrain.

"O wasn't you cunning, O wasn't you cute,
You didn't git way from the Frenchman's shoot (2)
'Tis not a divilish shin or leg you have at all,
They all was all knocked off at the Frenchman's ball."
Refrain.

"O Terry, Terry, Terry, divil a bit of God in you,
That you didn't git away from the Frenchman's shoot. (2)"
"O mother dear, you'd aught to'v seen the fun
When the Frenchman's ball took the legs off me,"
Refrain.

"Mother dear, you'd ought to know,
If the boys enlist they've got to go. (2)
There stands old Bonypart, stalks all round,
Fight or die or stand your ground,"
Refrain.

"My son Terry is neat and trim,
To every leg he has one shin, (2)
He's mama's pet and darling boy
He's the ladies' t'y and the girls own joy,
To the rum di ya, fa-da-diddle-ah,
Aye de rather rather rum di-ah.
