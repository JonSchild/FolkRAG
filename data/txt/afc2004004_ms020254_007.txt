BJ Tape 40, p. 5

To the mire, low, chile, 
In the mire, low, chile, 
In the mire, bow, chile, 
In the mire Jesus'll meet you, 
In the mire, when you bow, 
In the mire, then you rise
From the mire, higher and higher, 
From the mire, higher, I tell you, 
From the mire, when you a rose
From the mire, then you know, 
In the mire, soul converted,
In the mire, feel all right, 
In the mire you shout around. (2)
In the mire, Brother Gene, 
In the mire you come down, 
In the mire, come on down, 
In the mire, come on, chile, 
In the mire I want you to bow, 
In the mire, lower and lower, 
In the mire, lower I told you, 
In the mire, lower's the way, 
In the mire, Jesus'll meet you 
In the mire when you bow, 
In the mire, then you rise
From the mire higher and higher,  (2)
From the mire, when you arose
From the mire, then you know, 
In the mire, soul converted, 
In the mire, been baptized, 
In the mire you shout around. (3)
