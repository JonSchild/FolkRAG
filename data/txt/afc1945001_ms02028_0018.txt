Conduct of War, Cont'd.
     "There is a letter from a woman who signs herself Patriotic Mother. She
is from Jewell, Iowa. She says that she lives in a hotbed of people who are
criticizing the president. He, they say, is lackadaisical about the conduct
of the war. He stalls and we have lost the war in the Atlantic because of
his indecision. However, Patriotic Mother doesn't believe these things. She
is evidently very much for the president and is disgruntled by anti-administra-
tion talk."          Aug. 6 - Editor of Woman's Page Column, Des Moines Tribune
     "The administration - meaning the President - is too soft on this war. 
They should take a tougher attitude on the conduct of the war and not be
trying to please everybody."     Aug. 3 - Representative citizen
     "I believe that the United States and Great Britain will suffer if
they don't open up a second front very soon." - Aug. 4 - Housewife, college
                                                                    education and wife of business man
     "What is going to happen to all of us after this war. We will run
into a worse depression than we ran into in 1929. We will have all these
women in these jobs and they won't give up the jobs, and the men who come
back and then men who are here won't have a chance to work" Aug. 5
                                                      Remarks by group of unemployed working men.
     "They had read an article by some correspondent who said the first four
years of this war we would get the h____ whipped out of us and that the next
six years we would win. They agreed with this statement and thought that was
about the situation. They also thought there should be a second front opened 
up and wondered what was the matter with the big shots running the war that
they didn't get over there and take things apart."    Aug. 6
