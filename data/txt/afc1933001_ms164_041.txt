Black Mountain, N. C.

Dear Miss Andrews:

I appreciate your letter and the cards about 
Widducun Vare.  I wonder if you in your course of eighty
generous yours, you have not learned some old fashioned 
songs which may be of interest to a collector of such 
material.  If you have, I'd very much like to hear about
them and have you send them in to me.

Thanks again for the letter and cards.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax

P. S.  Since you have enjoyed the folk song program, you may 
be interested in knowing about another which I write called 
Back Where I Come From, over C.B.S. on Monday, Wednesday and 
Friday at 10:30.  In this broadcast, I am allowed to take 
a slightly more adult view of folk material.  I hope you 
will listen and write and tell me what you like about it.
