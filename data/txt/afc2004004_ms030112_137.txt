LARRY:
You know I, I live at 213 E. 10th Street so thats where I live now but let me tell you this, one day I was looking through some of my books that I got on Country Blues and everything and one of them had a newspaper clipping of Leadbelly that come out in the New York Times when he passed away in 1941 so I read on down and he said that he lived in 414 E. 10th Street. and I said WHAT.  I said I live on 213 about 20 some odd years later.
MRS. DAVIS:
I think it was E. 10th street, then he bought a home in Brooklyn, hard to find something together.
