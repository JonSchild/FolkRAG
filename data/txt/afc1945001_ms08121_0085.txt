that they had to put the
padlocks on the doors.

If this woman was
smart she would have known
that this book was a fake
because on the ration books
it has not got the price and
it has no number on the 
book like Ration Book 2
or it has not got how many
coats each person will get.
If she would have read it
more thoroughly she would
have known it was a fake
and that some saboture
just wanted her to spread
a rumor.
