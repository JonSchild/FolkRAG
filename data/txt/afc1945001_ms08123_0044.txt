Scrap

Last week the students of 
Inglewood High school collected
scrap metals of all kinds. 
Their slogan was," Slap a Jap with 
some of that scrap!"
Throughout the week the various 
metals were gathered
copper bronze
brass TIN
The campaign was very successful 
although it could have been more 
complete. 
The students of various high schools 
who took part in this very helpful
rally received tickets to a free
show sponsored by the Motion
Picture Industry. If all or-gan-
izations would co-operate 
like this one we would soon have
all of the scrap necessary for victory.
