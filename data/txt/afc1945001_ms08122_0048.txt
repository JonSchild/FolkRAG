     A young man who enlisted in 
the Army Air Corp wrote back home and
said that his R.O.T.C. training was very
useful in the Army. He said that in
his particular tent, he was the only boy
who had this training. In one instance
the mess call sounded. Being non-R.O.T.C.
boys, the men didn't know what it meant
and so they kept on working. Therefore, he
was the first one in line for his meal.
