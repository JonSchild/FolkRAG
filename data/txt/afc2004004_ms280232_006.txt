5) Then haying being over and harvest does draw near, 
Our master he does welcome us with plenty of beef and beer, 
We all sit round to drink the beer, while peace and plenty fills the year, 
And we'll be merry while we are here and drink to the ploughboy. 

6) Now harvest being over we start the plough once more, 
Our master has invited us, unlocks his cellar door, 
With cake and ale we have our fill because we've done our work so well, 
And there's no one can despise the skill of the brave ploughboy.

No John. (Fragment.) 

On yonder hill there lives a lady, 
But her name I do not know, 
I'll go court her for her beauty, 
Whether sheansweres yes or no. 
No John, no, no John no, 
No John, No John, No John, NO.

When Spring Come ON: 

1) When spring comes on the birds do sing, 
The lambs do skip and the bells do ring, 
While we enjoy their glorious song, so noble and so gay. 
Refrain: The primrose blooms and the cowslip, too, 
The violets in their sweet retire, 
The roses shining through the briar, 
And the daffadowndillies which we admire, 
Will die and fade away. 

2) Young men and maidens on mountains high and meadows green, 
They will talk of love and sport and play 
While these young lambs do skip away, 
At night they homeward wend their way when evening stars appear. 

3) The dairymaid to milking goes, her blooming cheeks as red as a rose 
She caries her pail all on her arm, so cheerful and so gay. 
She milks, she sings, and the valleys ring, 
The small birds on the branches there 
Sit listening to this lovelye fair, 
She is her master's trust and care, 
She is the ploughboy's joy.
