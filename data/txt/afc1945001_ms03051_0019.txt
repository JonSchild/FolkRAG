Memphis, August 15.
We are not going to have the present Administration meddling with and 
upsetting our racial relations down here. They are responsible for any 
trouble that may be brewing. If we were left alone to handle the 
situation, it could be done without any lasting bitterness and with the 
minimum amount of trouble. 5

Washington is a rat run. What with all the confusion and contradiction 
it is next to impossible to get anything done. (Businessman)

Practical business is over the head of most Washington bureaucrats.
