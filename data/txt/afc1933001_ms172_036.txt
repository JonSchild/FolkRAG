CHAMBERS OF JUDGE HICKS
KNOXVILLE, TENN.

218 New Post Office Bldg.,
July 22, 1941.

Dear Mr. Lomax,
     It is possible that I shant be able to answer your
letter with the specification that you might with. It is very
doubtful in my mind whether all the factors you desire exist 
in concentration in any one community. I recall for example the
difficulty which Benton MacKaye had in getting together a 
native orchestra for a little gathering some five years ago.
As I recalll we had to drive some fifty miles up into the Norris
basin to get a couple of boys who played guitars. On the other
hand one will occasionally run across fellows with guitars walking
along a road. You will recall of course Mr. Cecil Sharp's
experience in collecting what we know as the Kentucky Running
Set. He found that religious taboos had placed strictures on 
dancing and the like in many communities. My mother's family,
one branch of it, has lived in one community for ten generations
and yet I was taught no folk dancing or singing in my childhood.
However I have sat down occasionally with my mother and
aunt and have listened to them tell incidents of their child
hood and have suddenly realized that they have created the flavor
of a day long past.
     However there are many communities where men congregate
and tell stories by the hour. There are communities where in
spite of the changes wrought by the Great Smokies Park and the
T.V.A., or by industrialization and tourists and perhaps by research
folk such as yourself many of the old language forms exist
and where an occasional person will pick up a guitar. However
it may require some patience to draw these folks out. They are
not naive by any means, and I have known instances where situations
were "staged" for the benefit of outlanders, who were none 
the wiser.
     Now for suggestions. You have already written Dr. Kirkland
of the University of Tennessee. You have no doubt heard of
Richard Chase of Glade Spring, Virginia, near Damascus I believe 
it is, who is the soul of the White Top Festival. He is exceedingly
well informed; he is also trying to make his living from folk
studies. Miss Mary U. Rothrock, the T. V. A. Librarian has suggested
their Librarian at Huntsville, Ala. She also suggested two former
colleagues of Mrs. Kaylor, who are engaged in family removal
work, for the T. V. A. Of course after they get thru the communities
no longer exist. Then there is Mr. L. L. McDowell of Smithville, Tenn., 
who has taken a group a time or two to Miss Knott's festival in
Washington. If I recall, his work is in the nature of an attempt
to revive that which has been pretty much moribund. Mrs. Edna Lynn
Simms of Gatlinburg (at foot of Great Smokies) who has made a magnificent
