I know you've got my man,
I know you've got my man,
Try to hold him if you can.

I know that man don't want nobody but me,
I know that man don't want nobody but me,
If you don't believe it, I've got his little key.

If you don't leave my fuckin' man alone,
If you don't leave my fuckin' man alone
You only know what way that you will go home.

I will cut your throat and drink your fuckin' blood
[right out] [*like wine,*]
Bitch, I'll cut your fuckin' throat, draw your blood like
wine,
Because I want you to know he's a man of mine.

I tell you once, I'm not going to tell you no more,
I tell you once, I'm not going to tell you no more,
Right to the burying ground your big, black ass will go.

I'm going to tell him, I'm going to tell him on you,
I'm going to tell him, I'm going to tell him on you,
He'll either have me or he won't have you too.

Let me tell you one of the things I've said,
Let me tell you one of the things I've said,
The bitch that fucks my man, they'll find her among the
dead.

I know you don't believe a word that I'm saying,
I know you don't believe a work that I'm saying,
If you don't leave my man along, they'll find you 
every Decoration Day.
