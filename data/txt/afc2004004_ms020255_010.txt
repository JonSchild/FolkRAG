        An' she -- Said sumpthin' tol' her then, said, "If you can kill
them bedbugs, you can git forgiven for your sin." 
        An' then she tried. She said she done everything. Said she
beat 'em an' she throwed water on 'em, hot water ya know. Said
it looked like she jus' really workted them bedbugs until she jus'
woke up. An' she couldn't kill 'em. 
        An' then this, ah, voice spoke to her an' tol' her again that
was the five chirrun that she had killed, 'stroyed, ya know, tryin'
to be a spo't. Now, that's a life. See, she was tryin' to live
above someone else, see? Until ya bein' spo'ty an' don' have no
babies, see. So she had ta d'stroy five chirrun see. An' that's
the way they come before 'er
        An' she had prayed, ya know, for 'er sin. Ya see, 'an she
had prayed so an' then the Lord showed dis dat nigh. An' so she then
told 'im. She was goin' to hell. An' she had took five innocent
blood, a her own; tha's herse'f, killed herse'f, ya see. An' sure
enough, she did. Bus she said there later on about -- She didn't
die 'till about a mont' after that. 
        She sent down for this boy an' the peoples did, too. Tol'
'im her condition; she was gonna die an', for him to come to see
her, see? An' ah, she wanted to talk with 'im. An' he wouldn't

could, sayin' [a'] of him ta understand. Say she was gonna die. An'
she was goin' to hell; an' three weeks after she's goin', she meet
