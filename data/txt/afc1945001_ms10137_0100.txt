H.S. Sophomore-White-Female

1  - In the paper I heard about two 
boys being put in a concentration camp.
They didn't mention any names but I learned 
from a lot of school mates that the boys 
were Julius Fuhr and Abbie Fuhr, 
because they wanted to fight for Hitler.  
It just didn't seem right but that 
is how things like that are & it really 
shows you, you canâ€™t trust some of your best 
friends.

2.  They say the shortest distance is between 
two points is a straight line.  The 
Rummel - Plan is that way but it 
seems that [Hitler] Congress wants 
to go by the way of Africa to plan 
out how to pay the taxes.  I always 
laugh at some of the jokes 
they [wa] have in the paper & from 
people about how Congress goes 
about doing a simple thing.
