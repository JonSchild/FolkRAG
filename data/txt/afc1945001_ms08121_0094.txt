A 
English 
Anecdote
Since the war many things 
have happened to my family. For 
instance up until the war whatever 
we wanted, but now we have 
to have ration coupons to get the 
things we need. And the things 
that people can get without ration 
coupons usually cost a considerable 
amount of money. But it's all for 
the best, so it won't hurt us to 
do without things for awhile. As 
long as the boys at the front 
are getting what they need to 
win this war. 
Another thing is there have 
been several deaths of friends in 
the Armed Forces. A soldier friend 
was killed in Guadacanal, and 
another was killed somewhere in the 
Pacific. A sailor friend of the family 
is missing in action. And my cousin 
broke his leg while on manuvers.
