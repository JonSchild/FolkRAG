[handwritten in right margin] 39

Moses was goin' down to -- for them to hear?  An' God spoke to
Moses an tol' him to tell 'em to wash, wash they clo'es, an', an'
wash they skin an' clean out they very mouth ["very mouth" underscored].  See?  Tha's the
way you're supposed to go to heaven.  I mean plain [underscored] an' good an'
clean.  He wants ya to be clean [underscored], clean within and without.  So
they had to clean up theyselfs.  An' put on they clo'es like
peoples.  Ya see?  An' they had to clean out they very moufs
so some of 'em musta been, you know, filthy mouthted, you know.
Not on'y with words, but with tobacca or snuff or something.
Musta had something, 'cause He said to tell 'em to clean out
they very mouth ["very mouth" underscored].  An' so, they got to be clean to meet God.  They
couldn't have all that -- couldn't come to God -- that looks funny [underscored]
to me...

TL:  That's always been that way, huh?

BJ:  Yes, I'd look funny to me, prayin' to God with a mouth, with a
red mouth!  Ha, ha, ha!  That sho' -- oh, goo'ness, I was glad,
ow, nothin' like that -- I declare, I look on the people, sometimes
I say, No wonder you don't want to bow with your knees; your
mouf too red.  Sometimes they tell 'em to come up and be prayed 
for; they jus' sit back there; they 'bellious (rebellious)-hearted,
jus' sit.  But if they come up, an' they begin to understan'
an' see into it, it'll come to be shameful to 'em; they won't
sit.  How you stand up there readin' the Bible an' all that stuff,
polish around your mouth?  Your mouth is worser than any other
part; your face all right with your powder an' the rouge an'
stuff, but all that -- just blockaded your mouth, you know, with,
with that red stuff.  It jus' don't -- it just don't fit.  It's not
because I ain't never [underscored] used it.  But just 'cause it jus' truly
is not right.  I mean, in my rowdy days, I never used it.

TL:  You didn't?
