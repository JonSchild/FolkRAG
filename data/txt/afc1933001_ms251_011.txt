can make it to Camp Kechuwa
We can take care of Susan
but I don't believe we could
manage Patsy again, without
school hours, with your father
not feeling well. (That sentence
would be hard to diagram,
but I suppose you can reason
out what I mean.)
We have had no word from
Shirley since she (they) reached
Charleston. I hope all is well
with her.
We always listen with pride
to accounts of your work,
from whatever source. I suggest
you could help your
father with a chatty letter, 
if you ever feel chatty these
days - who does? Tell Elizabeth
I talked with her mother recently,
but I was leaving town and we didn't
get together. Did you remember
that it was a year ago last
week that you were in Texas?
Best of wishes always & love -
Deanie
We had a grand folklore meeting at Denton -
Students papers were an innovation.
John Alan doing fine; he and Susan became
fast friends.
