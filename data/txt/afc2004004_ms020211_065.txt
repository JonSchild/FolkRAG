Dear Bessie,

We were all very disappointed that you came through New York
and did not stop to see us.  Our telephone numbers are all
with "information," but I'll give them to you now so you won't
miss us again.  The new office is UN 5 8712.  My home is
TR 4 5668.  Dena is YU 9 5016.

I hope you had a good time in Massachusetts and that the
group came out of it with some money.  I am writing to
Minneapolis again today to see why they haven't sent the
contracts.  If they send them directly to St. Simons, please
besure to send them up here so I can look at them before
you sign them.

Did you get your Social Security all right?

I can't tell you how sorry I was to hear about our friend
Willis Proctor.

Write us your news when it comes in, and let us know how you
are doing.  I'll be in touch as soon as I hear from Minneapolis
or anything else.

Love,

Alan Lomax

P. S.  Bessie, honey, you deserve a spanking for not coming
to see us!  The Tatums were here for a week recently and took
little Reece with them, for good this time.  He was causing
too much trouble at school, I guess because he just wanted
to be with his real parents.  I can't seay I blame him, but
I am just heartbroken.  I'm going to rent out his room and
that of his baby-sitter so that I can afford to keep my pretty
apartment, but it is rough going just now.  I'm taking next
week off work and another week or more later in the summer.
I hope you'll be up this way then so you can visit and we can
spend lots of time together.  Val, Ira, Claudia and all expected
you to come through New York.  They always ask about you and
will be sorry to have missed you.  Love,
