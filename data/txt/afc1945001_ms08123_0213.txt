Fighting With Words
  In the jungles of Guadacanal, the Japs
fight the Americans with many tricks one of
these tricks is learning to speak English.
  A soldier will thrashing his way
through the steaming vegetation when
suddenly some one will call out "Hey
Charlie, come here!" If the Yank investigats,
he is a dead soldier.
  A sentry was on duty one night and
he heard the sound of footsteps approaching
through the darkness. "Who goes there?"
he called out leveling his bayoneted rifle,
"Its me, an American captain, bringing
in my platoon." A voice answered. The
sentry fired his rifle several times;
bodies crashed into the brush. The
sentry found three dead Japs.
  When the sentry was asked how he
knew they were Japs, the sentry replied
"The English was just too "dogoned" fluent
and grammatical for a marine."
