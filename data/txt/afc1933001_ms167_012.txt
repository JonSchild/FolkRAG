MEMORANDUM
To Dr. Spivacke
From Alan Lomax

In regard to the letter from Mr. Getchell, I would like to
point out that the next to the last phrase in the eighth
paragraph of Mr. Getchell's letter is pretty far off the
track as far as I am concerned. Miss Smith sings music hall
ballads in a ferociously successful manner but this style
would, it seems to me, rip to tatters, violate, maim, cripple
and otherwise destroy the subtle and usually undersung
ballads of the people. The Archive records are, of course,
available to those as wants them, but I don't see why we
should go after Kate Smith very vigorously. "Barbara Allen",
"Pretty Polly" and "The Streets of Laredo" will be here long
after she has finished writing her memoirs.

The letter is a classic and if you don't mind I should like
to have a copy of it for my files.
