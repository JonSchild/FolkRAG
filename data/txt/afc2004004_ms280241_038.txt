TAPE 82: JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
The Deadly Wars are Past and Blown.
1) For the dadly wars they are past and blown,
And gentle peace returning,
It left man's a sweet babe fatherless
And many a widow mourning.

2) I left the line and the tainted field,
Where I'm no longer a lodger,
My humble knapsackon my heel
I'm a poor but honest soldier.

3) For a lee light heart was in my breast,
My hands were stained wi' plunder,
And all for my Scottie home again
I carried on, did wonder.

4) I thought upon the banks of Kyle,
I thought upon my Nancy,
I thought upon the bewitching smile
Thathad caught my youthful fancy.

The Battle of Harlow:
1) As I cam' by the Greyland and doon by Netherhall,
There were fifty-thousand hieland men a-marchin' to Harlow,
Singing diddi-i-o, sing fa-la-do, sing diddi-e-i-o-i-aye.
2) It did ye come frae the hielands, man, and did ye come o'er the Eye?
And di ye see McDonald and his men as they marched frae Skye?

3) It's I cam frae the hielands, man, and I came o'er the Wye,
And I saw McDonald and his men as they marched frae Skye.

4) It's were you near and near enough, did ye their number s see?
Come, tell to me, John Hieland man, what might there numbers be?

5) For I was near and near enough, and I their numbers saw,
There were fifty thousand hieland men a-marching to Harlow.

6) For they went on and further on, and down by Bulchuine,
It's there they met Sir James O'Ross, who answered John the Grimes.

7) If that be stout Sir John O'Ross one o' the muckle speed,
We will call upon our merry men and we'll turn our horses' heads.

8) "O nay, O nay," said Sir John OGraeme, sich things will mauna dee,
For the gallant Grames were never but, nor try what they can dee.
