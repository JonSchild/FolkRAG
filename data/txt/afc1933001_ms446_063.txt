Out of my stony griefs,
     Bethel I'll raise,
     So by my woes I'd be.
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
     Nearer to Thee.

Or if on joyful wing,
     Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon and stars forgot,
     Upward I'd fly;
     Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
     Nearer to Thee.

No. 48

O, sing to me a song of heaven,
     When I am called to die;
Sweet songs of holy ecstasy
     To waft my soul on high.

Chorus--There'll be no sorrow there,
          There'll be no sorrow there;
          In heaven above where all is love,
          There'll be no sorrow there.

When cold and sluggish drops
     Roll off my marble brow,
Break forth in song of joyfulness,
     Let heaven begin below.

When the last moments come,
     O, watch my dying face,
To catch the bright seraphic gleam,
     Which o'er my features play.

Then to my raptured ear
     Let one sweet song be given;
