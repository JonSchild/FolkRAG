Dear Sir: I beg to submit a for-
mal report on a Folk Song recording
trip I made from Aug 27 to Sept 14 for
the Library of Congress. During this trip
I traveled a distance of 2,023 miles
in my automobile and filled both
sides of 33 12 inch [records] disc, a total
of more than 100 songs. In my
travels I visited and made records 
at Wichita Falls, Aspermont, and
Pampa, Texas; Hollis, Oklahoma
and at Pine Bluff, Ark. En route
I visited some mountain communities
East of Fayetteville, Ark., but
found no worth while material.
Respectfully submitted,
John A. Lomax

This trip was made on the express written
authority of Alan Lomax, in charge of the
Folk Song Archive.
