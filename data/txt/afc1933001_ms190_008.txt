OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 

[*Fellowship*]

Mr. Alan Lomax,
Division of Educational Service,
Bureau of Special Operations,
Office of War Information,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Alan:

     I am sorry that nothing has become of
the Rosenwald plan. I hardly know what to do but
let it go for the present. Perhaps all of the
folksongs will not evaporate before the war is over.

     If I hear of any material that I think
may be useful to you I shall certainly send it on
to you. The prospect of traveling seems very remote
now and I doubt very seriously if I get to Washington 
now, but if I should I would naturally look you up.

     I have not seen the Harrises but hear
from them occasionally. I am glad to have news
of Jo. Take care of yourself and come to see 
us sometime.

     With best wishes, I am
     
     Sincerely yours,
     John
