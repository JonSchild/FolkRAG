APPALACHIA R-82 cont.
... we moved away from there in the forties, I believe it was-
I been where I am now ever since 1940. My mother is dead, my
daddy, he's 85. He's still living, he still drives and does 
as he pleases...
Another man: Oh, I've been raising dogs about 30 years. Course
I didn't raise many when I was pastor of the church. I was
pastor of the church for 21 years-- almost got out of the beagle
hound business, but when I retired, why, I got me some more dogs
and some of these dogs, I'm just experimenting really, with these.
I don't know what they're going to do. I think maybe that I'll
have a stronger dog, quicker dog, and I'm a hoping for that.
AL: What do you get out of dog raising and fooling with dogs?
Man: Just a pleasure, I enjoy it. I love my beagle hound, and
all these fellas here with me today, we all love hearing them
run and that's the pleasure we get one of those, we breed one
and really get a good dog, why then we're thrilled about it.
AL: How do you tell if it's a good dog?
Man: Well, if he stays on the track and gets the scent when the
rabbit scents him, why, and stays out there and keeps going, we
know he's a good dog... (a question is asked-unintelligible)
No, you gotta be looking at 'em most of the time. You can
sort of tell by listening to 'em. You can usually tell which
one it is, but most of the time you gotta really look at 'em.
Sometimes they sound good, but it's some other feller doing the
work, it's some dog who's not talking so loud, you know. Sometime
it's not the fella that talks the loudest.
