No audience, so far as we could tell, ever disturbed
his self-confidence or his belief in himself as an artist.
There was nothing shy or modest in him. [He wanted everybody
to hear him sing and play [the right way, that is, his] the guitar.]
Once , after hearing Cab Calloway at a theatre in Harlem, he
