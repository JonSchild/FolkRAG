it back to me as it is the only
one I have I wouldn't have any
thing happen to it for anything.
Although you may have seen one of
these [write] articles I do wish that
you could have contacted either
myself or my sister when you were
in Smith Center. I think we could
have straightened you out on these
things and you wouldn't be
in doubt about the tune or
any of the words as we know
it just as our father knew it &
sang it. Thank you so much
for your interest and I hope
I have helped you

Respectfully
Mrs Emmet Womer
