A: Is Dr. Watts the same as it used to be?
W: Well, Yeah, pretty well Dr. Watts is the same. Course you give out [to] Dr. Watts -- it's -- let me see -- was showing a lot. Dr. Watts come from what Dr. Watts had sing. [I give it out and] Dr. Watts looked [in the saucer], and he [says it's the same. And he made] a hymn out, and Dr. Watts saw different things in his travels that he made hymns out of um. So when we give out a hymn out of that book, we say we're gonna sing one of Dr. Watts' hymns. Dr. Watts got some hymns in there that he composed [and] to be give out.
A: Well, where did the folks in the old days --they couldn't read in those days-- how did they learn [that] them?
W: Well, some of um knowed them and the others learned um. I don't know where these books [were] was -- how they got [ahold] holt of um. [As a child] As I told you yesterday, I don't know -- they don't look to me like any of the oldtime folks back here in [ancient] the old days [whoever] [even] oughta knowed A from B[.], because [They] they'd went to no school[.] & they got no learning. But I've heard my grandmaw say at times that Old [Master] [?] would [have] have um all [go] up to the house Sunday morning and [give a line of] get her catechism and take a line of lesson[s]. And the old men and the old sisters would say they had to move in, [give a] would get a little Testament, [would learn] read some in the Testament and they would learn um. That's the way they got um. I don't see any other way they got um -- they didn't have no schools to go to. They didn't [have] do nothing but catch what they could. (upward cheerful inflection) That's all I see.
A: How'd you get your learning?
W: How'd I git my learning? I ain't got none much (laughter).
A: You learned how to read.
