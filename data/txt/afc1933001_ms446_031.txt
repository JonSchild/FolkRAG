12.

I hope the Lord will pity me,
And bring me so that I can see.

Now twelve o'clock is rolling on,
When I must close my little song,
When I lie down upon my bed,
My cheeks are wet with tears I shed.

If the world did all belong to me,
I would give it all if I could see.
I pray, do Lord, remember me,
And bring me so that I can see.

I hope my friends will bear in mind,
I made this song since I have been blind.
And pray to God for mercy free,
To bring me so that I can see.

A POOR WAYFARING STRANGER

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe,
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger--
In that bright world to which I go.
I'm going there to see my Father,
I'm going there no more to roam;
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going over home.

I know dark clouds will gather around me,
I know my way is rough and steep,
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me,
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep.
I'm going there to see my mother.
She said she'd meet me when I come,
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going over home.
