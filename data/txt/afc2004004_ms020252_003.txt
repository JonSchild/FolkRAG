2nd Reel of 10/12/61, Song 11


I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT THE LORD

Lawd, I don't know what I'd do without the Lawd, (2)
Singin' and prayin' every day,
Tryin' to keep on the good always,
Lawd, I don't know what I'd do without the Lawd.

Lawd, I don't know where my body will soon be laid, (2)
My grave is waitin' every day,
Oh, sinner, you'd better pray
'Cause you don't know where your body will soon be laid.

Lawd, I don't want to live and die without the Lawd, (2)
Singin' and Prayin' every day,
Tryin' to keep on the good always,
'Cause I don't know when ol' death will call me home.

Lawd, I don't know when ol' death will call me home, (2)
Oh, death is ridin' every day,
Oh, sinner, you better pray,
'Cause you don't know when ol' death will call you home.

Lawd, I don't want to live and dies without the Lawd, etc.
