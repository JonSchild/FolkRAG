The Old Chisholm Trail

ready by the time the herd and the hungry men reached the spot.

The chuck wagon carried the blankets and surplus clothing of 
the cowboys as well as the food.

And so, when a cowboy had grown tired of carrying his slicker 
tied behind his saddle and had put it in the wagon, a rain cloud in 
the distance was sad news for him. He was in for a long ride without protection 
in the pelting rain. The stanza quoted shows how he felt.

A trail herd often passed bunches of cattle grazing near the 
trail. It was difficult to keep these cattle from joining the herd and 
following it up the trail. The trail cattle, far away from their home 
ranges, often bawled as they shambled along, a summons for other cattle 
to come with them.

Sometimes the owners of the trail herd were quite willing for 
these vagrant bunches to join in with their cattle.

Some herds doubled in size before they arrived at the end of the 
trail. A cowboy who was expert in persuading the strays to join the 
herd was sometimes called a good  "rustler." A custom grew up on the 
trail that the killing of a stray for beef was above reproach. Our cowboy 
poet forever preserves a record of this practice, when he sings:

Stray in the herd and boss says "kill it!"
So we bedded that stray in the bottom of the skillet.

"The Old Chisholm Trail" was often sung at night about the camp 
fire, after the day's riding was over, while the cowboys sat in a circle 
around the glowing embers. A leader would sing a stanza and the entire 
crowd would roar out the chorus:

Come-ti-yi-yippy-yippy-yea, yippy-yea!
Come-ti-yi-yippy-yippy-yea!
