Dear Paul:

Enclosed is the original of the contract with Prestige together
with the schedule setting forth the amount of copyright royalties
per album, and a leaflet. Also enclosed is sub-contract. Please 
call me about this right away.

The Atlantic music publishing company has told me that they have
transferred all their song rights in our albums to Hill & Range
and I have had no response to a letter to Hill & Range about what
happened to the royalty payments to the singers.

All the best,
Alan Lomax
