And I wanted all the boys to think about Mr. Fournet's son----
who was lieutenant Governor behind Governor O.K. Allen----- 
head of the board of pardons in New Orleans----  his name was Mr.
Fournet----- when they write a [lt] letter[*,*] I want 'em [*to write a letter*] to mention
his name in the letter-----
When you write you a letter, please don't forget,
Lieutenant Gov'nor, Honorable Mr. Fornet.
An' here's the las' verse I said to Governor O.K. Allen an'
just' what he done---
Had you, Gov'nor O.K. Allen , like you got me,
I'd wake up in the mornin' let you out on reprieve.
