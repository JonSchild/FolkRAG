THE FARMER COMES TO TOWN, continued

III.
When the banker says he's broke And the merchant's up in smoke,
They forget that it's the farmer feeds them all.
It would put them to the test If the farmer took a rest,
Then they'd know that it's the farmer feeds them all.
The farmer is the man, The farmer is the man,
Lives on credit 'til the fall;
And his pants are wearing thing, His condition it's a sin,
He's forgot that he's the man who feeds them all.

ARE YOU SLEEPING?

I                                                                 II.
Are you sleep-ing, Are you sleep-ing, Broth-er John? Broth-er John?

III                                                                           IV
Up, and join a un-ion! Up, and join a un-ion! C. I. O.! C. I. O.!

ASSURANCE
(Tune: "Comin' Through the Rye")

Words by Harvey P. Meyer

Scotch Tune

If a body saw a body turn the world awry,
If somebody stopped that body, need we waste a sigh?
If a body found a body robbed and left to die,
If a body saved that body, would we question why?

2.
If a body saw a body poor and knew not why,
If we made him rich and happy, should somebody cry?
If somebody helped all bodies, lift themselves up high,
If we thus can save each other, should we fear to try?

(From a Workers' Song Book, issued by the
Dallas Local of the Socialist Party of Texas)
