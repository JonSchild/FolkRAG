BJ TAPE 15, p. 32

Ha, in this old field!  An' nobody wouldn't work for 'im.  So
he got us to do it.  An' Mr. Langford (OWNER OF THE PLANTATION
WHERE SHE MOVED WHEN 11 YEARS OLD) got us, got us to do it
an', an' he paid us.  You see.
AL:  How much'd he pay you?
BJ:  Aw, they was payin' by the acre, three dollars a acre.
Wa'n' that. . .        that was money, chile!
AL:  Jesus Christ!
BJ:  I ain't jokin'.
AL:  Three dollars an acre for choppin'?
BJ:  Three dollars an acre.  Three dollars. . .
AL:  Did you chop the whole thing?  (ALL ABOVE HARD TO HEAR BECAUSE
LINES OVERLAP)
BJ:  Oh I have -- Sho'.  I have chopped cotton for, for a dollar an'
a half an acre.
AL:  Oh, Bessie!
BJ:  Oow!  An' I -- D-do you know what I used to git over?
Ah, ah, me an' my partner together, ah, ah, git over three acres
every day an' leave the sun runnin'.  Tha' ri'.  An' go when we
go ready.  'Cause we could natchully pull a hoe.
N-no joke!  Oh, boy!  I could pull Blind Ida.  Yeah.
     But this field we couldn't pull like that, 'cause that cotton
was big an' that grass was bad.  So I told Leola, I say, "Gi' me
a dip a snuff."
     Leola say, "You want one?"
     I say, "Yeah."  An' look like I wanted it.  An' I got that
stuff -- I didn't have no paper.  I'd been always tryin', when I
was lil' to do it, but put it in a paper.  An' soon as it soaked
through the paper an' begin to taste in my mouth, I spit it out, see?
