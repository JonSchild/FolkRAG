July 2, 1938.

Miss Bess Brown Lomax,
c/o Thomas Cook and Sons, 
2 Place de la Madelaine, 
Paris, France.

Dear Bess:

Jealousy has had me in its thrall all spring--jealousy
of you in Hungary and on the Danube and in youth hostels
in Germany, but now I'm beginning to feel a little
less envious. In fact, I expect after this summer 
to be much more cosmopolitan than you, despite your 
European tour. The reason:-

Dear Sir: 

The Archive of American Folk Song
plans a rapid recording survey of Michigan, 
Wisconsin and Minnesota during the
summer. If you know of the location of
any Jugoslavian baroto blowers or any
Swiss chantey singers, I would greatly
appreciate your calling me by long distance
before morning.

By the middle of September, I hope to be speaking an 
interesting dialect composed of Norwegian, Swedish, 
Icelanding, German, Canuck, Hungarian, Finnic, Polish, 
Russian and Oshkosh. You may expect to receive an
autographed photo of me holding up my first muskie by
at least the end of this month. 

The work is going to be very interesting. I'm going
to Detroit armed with letters of introduction to all
the fractions of the United Automobile Workers and to 
the Massaba Iron Ore Range of Minnesota and the I.W.W.
of Duluth for union material, that assuming a galaxy of 
all sorts of exotic songs and instruments plus all their 
Americanizations. 

Besides which, Elizabeth may by that be doing 
field work in an official capacity for the Writers Project
of the WPA, visiting their state collections and
sizing up their field workers, which will make everything
much more interesting.
