There is an aftermath to the affair of Queen Wilhelmina and the proposed stop at The Homestead in Ludlow. Last week a detective officer appeared at The Homestead to inquire about the letter which the proprietor has sent, demanding pay for the preparations she had made for the royal guests. He declared that neither the Queen nor her secretary had seen the letter, but all communications from unknown persons were investigated by a detective. If he assured himself that there was nothing  harmful to the Queen at The Homestead, the proprietor of the establishment was not at all assured  that she would be paid for the trouble taken to entertain the Queen and her followers.
