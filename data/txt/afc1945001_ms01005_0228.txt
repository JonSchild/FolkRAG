Mr. A. J. Kilday
Vice President, Seventh District
Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Alliance
   and Bartenders' International League of America
32 South Sixth Street
Minneapolis, Minnesota

Dear Mr. Kilday:

               This is in acknowledgment of your letter of September
30th, addressed to the Office of Facts and Figures, which, as
you probably know, has been superseded by the Office of War Information.
Since the question of rumors is the responsibility
of the Bureau of Intelligence, of which I am in charge, I am
answering your letter.

              We are preparing a statement of the causes of rumor,
along with suggestions as to how local groups, such as your
own, may aid us in collecting them, cataloging them, and relieving
the anxiety which produces them. We are interested in
your cooperation and trust that when you receive the material
we will be sending you in a few days you and your associates
in the International Alliance and Bartenders' International
League will consider our material and include its recommendations
in your plans. 

                                          Sincerely yours,

                                          R. Keith Kane
                                          Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
