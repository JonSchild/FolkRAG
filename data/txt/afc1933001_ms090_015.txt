My dear John Lomax:

Your note of January 8th is most welcome. It gives me
chance to run over in my mind some developments in our
knowledge of American backgrounds since the day you and I
talked in St. Louis at the meeting of the Modern Language
Association. That was back in 1933. That was the first time
in my experience that the Association went back to lively
interest in the collection of American ballads. I know that
this was a strong interest in the old days at Harvard University,
but your demonstration made it again a practical one. Everyone
would say that you have done remarkable work in proving that
literary history is made from living people quite as well as
from manuscripts. Some of this demonstration is on the record
at the Library of Congress. I hope that both you and your son
have years of work of the same kind, in which to keep on with
collecting and also with publishing.

Yours sincerely,
David H. Stevens

That's an apt summation.
