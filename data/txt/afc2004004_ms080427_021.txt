APPALACHIAN JOURNEY   -18

[SINGING]
     More and more we learn about the mountain
communities where blacks and whites lived neighbors and
swapped favors and stole each other's music.
[MUSIC]
    When the, the five strong banjo appeared this
was of course a, an instrument of African origin, of the
banjar, and was given by white musicians the fifth string.
So there was a constant high pinging droan there that was
put in between every, every beat.
[MUSIC]
     A further kind of syncopation had it in,
because with the, the banjo, which is a sort of strung drum,
you really began to be able to play rhythm with both, with
both hands hammering on, sliding.  And this [dinging] note
of the fifth string changed everything.
[SINGING]
     When you see Tommy John kicking out the
melody in the good Celtic fashion and at the same time doing
all sorts of bluesy twists, you see the system really at
work.  He's singing a favorite tune out of the period when
railroads began to come into the mountains.  It's, it's a 
black tune to begin with.
