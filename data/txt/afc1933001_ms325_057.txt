OUR OLD PROFIT SYSTEM

- By Joel Nyquist - 

We plow under cotton, we plow under wheat,
We plow under clover that's mellow and sweet,
We cut down the trees of the fruits that we eat; 
Our old profit system is our pet belief.

The banker, the lawyer, the merchant, the chief;
Our old profit system in its bold relief,
The rich man, the poor man, the beggar man, thief.

We drain all the forests and swampy lands; 
We flood all the mountains and all desert stands;
We dam all our ditches and dam all our streams,
And nature in turn seems to dam all our dreams.

Our old profit system is our pet belief;
The banker, the lawyer, the merchant, the chief;
Our old profit system in its bold relief,
The rich man, the poor man, the beggar man, thief.

We build mighty warships to sail on the seas,
We build mighty air fleets to do as we please;
These arms of destruction we claim are for peace,
Our old profit system, how soon will it cease?

The banker, the lawyer, the merchant, the chief: 
Our old profit system in it bold relief:
The rich man, the poor man, the beggar man, thief.
