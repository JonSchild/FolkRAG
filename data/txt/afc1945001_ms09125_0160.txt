[* the Geo. Glenn - 338 II eng. *]

Every body every pay day, buy a bond the U.S.A. way,
thats the job its up to you and me.
Butcher, Baker, banker, scholor
take a dime from every dollar
Every one pitch in for victory.

Every body every pay day, every farmer every hay day
top the crop with dimes for Uncle
Sam.
ten percent thats the rent
Every one must pay for a home in
the U.S.A.

Gossip
I heard a lady next door say that her husbands
friend told his son that a neighbor of his told his mother
that his sister said a man told her a soldier said
that a convoy was leaving next month.
