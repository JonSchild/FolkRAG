you see. He was natchully get in him some milk. He mus' ha' been
enjoyin' it [right] with his tail an' the tail struck Cassius' feet,
An' great goodness!
   Tha's John Davis' cousin. See, my daughter is John Davis'
cousin's child, you see? Tha's what, tha's what we come in at,
you see? My daughter's [father] father and John Davis' father are two
brothers. An' so, that's where that they come in there.
   An' so he got up from there an' he took that, an' he [done]
jus' done that way. An' as he was doin' that way (he was jus' bumpin'
and flow -?- thought I had the covers, come at -?- thought the 
come at him too -?-) I said, "What's the matter?" He said
"Nothin', nothin'." So he figure I gonna get too scared. He say
he wanna kill the snake and not let me see it, see? I lit the 
lamp. We didn' ha' no light; we had a big, ol', great big, ol'
lamp with a pretty globe over it. An' I lit that lamp an' I see 
that thing [woun' on] wallowin' on that floor with all that milk, an' that
other thing out there; that was 'is tongue. [His tongue was] Slung his tongue clean
out his mouth. [Throw] Throwed his tongue out. He know how to do out,
[stickin'] slung the tongue out his mouth. He say snake's tongue was easy
to throw out; I seen him do it several times -- [rat] black snakes and black
snakes like that. Jus' turn em over and over sometime way you do, 
then they do sumpin' with 'em an' their tongue will come out their
mouth. An' that milk, oow! An' I knowed that. An' I jus' caught 
my breas'. Gre-at goodness! I was scared near 'bout to death.

   An' so, but that passed away. An' way after, long that, 
I would leave my chile home, you know, too, you know. 'Cause she's
walkin'. I le' her home; I work aroun', close in the fields, you know,
an' come back often to see about her, jus' like Mama did 'bout me.
Well, we had a well in the yard an' I was always afraid of that well,
that she would climb on it. But she never did. Any way, she got so
comfortable -- I leave her food, you know, and the water, where she
could get it. She could see us across them big, open fiel's. An'
everytime we got to where everytime I come home, she said, "The 
rabbit eat; the rabbit eat bread; the rabbit...Here you come, the
rabbit [go on] gone." Well, I figure she said "the rats", you know? I 
knew she talkin' about rats. I knew that's what we used to talk
