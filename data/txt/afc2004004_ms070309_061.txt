may be ready to do serious recording 
work. He has everything to learn but
the feel of & flare for the material.

July 13 - A day of some turmoil beginning 
at 8 and ending in a filthy hotel
room at 3:00 A.M., the 14th. Waited
an hour for Jones in Johnson's office,
then went to work on the field interviews
done by Adams & Young. They turned
out to be quite revealing - statistically 
useable material.
Called on Work at 2, later
joined by Jones and two friends
whom I was told [with] to my surprise
were to go to Coahoma County with us.
One was a very white girl - Mrs. Wormley
doing her doctorate on So. Literature.
The other was Sr. Eduardo from Sa√µ Paulo -
along for the ride, # both of them.
Spent the afternoon listening to
Jones interesting, but slightly drunken
stories. Dinner with Schmidt full
of complaints against everybody. 
Session later with Jones in which
I stated flatly I wouldn't go
