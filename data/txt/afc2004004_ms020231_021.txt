fall a the year if you want to. Well, that's the way that was:
This man was goin' through sellin' Bibles an' ah, Mr. (Dr.)
Haris got her a Bible. She wasn't home; she was down in Herod,
in the town, lil', ol' town. An' he thought he was doin' sumpin'
so grand. He put this Bible right on the center table. You know,
so when she come -- You know how, if you wanna do, have sumpin'
to surprise yo' wife or something. And he put it on this center
table.
And when she come in that do' -- They had a walk out from
the yard -- out from the do'step to go out to the gate. Jus' like
my walk at, at my house. An' um, he ah, an' he said, when she
came in there, an' she walked on through, to the kitchen, an' she
seed this Bible, she come back. An' she asked him what was that.
He had that on the table. An' he tol' 'er, said, "I bought
ya a Bible."
An' she picked that Bible up an' walked to that door an'
chucked it out that door. An' she tol' 'im, "I'd rather have
the devil [in] from hell in the house than have a Bible."
An' that Bible [skidded] skated, he said, clean from there where she
chucked it, he said clean to the gate. An' it hurted him; he
cried. He natchully cried! It hurted him to know that she didn't
want a Bible in the house, you see?
So? It wasn' long, the baby was born. An' there it was...
The devil from somewhere. Purity devil! The baby was, ah, ah'
midwives what grannied on her, [the] a colored woman, ah, grannied
on her. An' ah, this colored woman seed this baby, an then went
there. An' she say that this baby bein' born, he jus' come forth.
You know, you know, jus' like -- it wasn't nothin', you know?
I mean, it wasn't no trouble when time for him to be bo'n.
