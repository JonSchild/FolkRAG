Her father was a fisherman, and illiterate
and she had very little schooling.  And ah, she
[*Y*]     
had to work in the fields from the time she
was a very young girl, and ah, the big thing
in their life was the praise house.[*]*]  Ah, in the
praise house, ah, which was non denominational, 
ah, [*[*] the kind of place that the blacks put
together under slavery for their own kind of
worship, because they weren't permitted to go
[*Z*]     
to the white church.  They had their own little
ah shack out in the woods somewhere, where 
they got together and praised Jesus and,and 
the prophets, and dreamed of freedom [*]*] and made
the songs of:  like God Down Moses, which were 
a prologue to, ah, to the freedom they all
dreamt was coming to them.  Although they 
[*05 . 19 . 31. 17.*]     dared not say anything about it. 

Well in those - those praise houses are, are
still found in the Sea Islands, [*[*] and ah Janie
[* Z *
cont: *] 
is a leading sister in one of them.  And there
you see the way spirituals were originally
sung.  Ah, everybody singing together in
overlap, in interweave, in polyrythmn and with 
an intensity that is ah, ah, almost ah
unendurable - a real African performance. [*]*]
