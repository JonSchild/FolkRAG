himself, for nearly two years thereafter. In 1770 the Sons of Liberty
fought the British mercenaries in the streets of New York - the first
battle of the American revolutions, the Battle of Golden Hill.

Nationalities: New York City has always been a cosmopolitan town
and it will be amusing to portray the arrival of the first Chinaman, the
first Negro and the first Jew.

Music: For musical material we will utilize Dutch and English folk-
songs, and shanteys, pirate songs (Captain Kidd was taken into custody in
or near New York harbor and there is a rousing folk-song that tells in
the bloodiest detail his history), the popular airs of the revolutionary
period (see "Popular Music of George Washington's Day", Engel, Strunk, and
Sol Bloom), and Indian music. Yankee Doodle will come to town dancing in
Dutch wooden shoes, stick a feather or two in General Howe's behind and
march out triumphantly with the revolutionaries of 1789.

Contrasts and analogies: The first Nine Ole Men, the first argument
about the Mayflower, the first gangsters, the origins of the first great
fortunes (in the Bolting milling monopoly and piracy) - such things can
make some rare comedy.

Techniques of presentation:
Huge backdrop: Manhattan and the burroughsdone in the flat
dull green of the wilderness the Dutch found in 1609. On this the growth
of the city can be shown in lights as the pageant progresses, from the
lighting of the first campfire to the building of the World's Fair of 1939.

Shadows: Against the gigantic masses of the land and sea on the
the backdrop the early settlers and citizens will cast the long shadows that
their almost legendary character warrants; as the pageant moves, on the shadows
will dwindle in size until at last the men move small and unimportant against
the glowing face of the city that they have built.

C Choruses: As each episode is concluded, its characters will withdraw 
into the shadows beneath the backdrop and there separate into two
groups which will participate in the action of the pageant as it progresses.
One group might be called, "The People", and the other, "The Mighty".
These groups, growing as the city grows, representing the living and the
dead of the city, will comment on the action that goes on before them,
will try to win the living characters over, will join in their songs, will
at times participate in the action on the stage. Image the dramatic way
these groups might be used in the revolutionary scenes: The Mighty marching
behind General Howe singing "God Save the King" and then scattering
before Washington who leads "The People" out of the shadows with Yankee
Doodle riding high. (This may sound a bit didactic, but if the modernisms
of the 17th and 18th centuries are played up it can be made extremely
effective, viz: the Madison Square Garden pageants.)
