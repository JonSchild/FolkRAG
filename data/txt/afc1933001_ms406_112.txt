["Ten Dollar" Bill"]

1. "Ten Dollar" Bill's a bronc, pard, an' he's
got a heap o' sense;
That's him standing over yonder, pe[a]ekin'
through the corral fence.
He's different from some horses, for
he's shy[s] the yeller streak.
An' we're just like clost relations - sorter
brothers, so' to speak.
He's as foxy as they make 'em, an' plumb
full o' nerve an' grit â€” 
Start that hoss t' trailin' cattle, an' he
don't know when t' quit!
Wonder how I come t[o]]' name him? Well,
i  it didn't take much skill.
Yuh see I bought that bronc, pard,
for a lone ten dollar bill!

2. See them scars along his fourlegs an'
that long one down his side?
Well, they marks the time that me
an' him near crossed the Great Divide.
We was down in Black Hawk Basin,
hazin' out a bunch o' beef.
