August 10â€“15, 1942

[*210*]

Submitted by Baird Middaugh, Social
Security Board, Minneapolis, Minn.

1. That General MacArthur's popularity is greatly on the wane; that the
newspapers built him up too much.

Heard in Minneapolis, Minn. August 10

2. That the war agencies (WPB, OPA, OCD) hire too many people, aren't
well organized, and their personnel don't have a clear idea of their
functions.

Hear this four or five times a month. Minneapolis, Minn.

3. That there is no reason why the Roosevelt boys shouldn't see frontline
service just the same as any other young men.

August 12, 1942. Minneapolis, Minn.

4. That Tony Martin shouldn't have a naval commission; that the whole
Arnoff deal was shady.

August 14, 1942. Minneapolis, Minn.
