LARRY:
Well Brother Davis said the whole thing was between me and her you know. He thought she was nice, he thought she was a nice girl.
FRIEND:
Then I had mama, and then I had John to watch, it was really cute I had my water things, I had my boy, anyway I had to take the phone call, you see while I was doing this, I don't know who was on the phone but she sounded real good.

And then I sing "Sleep on B. Davis, Sleep on, Sleep on let the day roll past,
