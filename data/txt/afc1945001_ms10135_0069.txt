1. there is a joke about a Negro soilder behind
the German line and upon facing a high German
soilder he took his get razor from his pocket and
made a swing at him. "Ha, Colored boy" said
the German, "you missed me." "Yeh," said the
Negro, "Just wait 'till you try to wiggle your hand."

3. If the war would cease,
we'd win the peace
from the dirty Axis dogs,
And we'd wipe the Japs,
clean off the maps
and they'd pass away like fog.

4. Here lies Rommel's pants,
His shirt he also lost
If he stays in Africa Another Year
His shorts will next be lost.
