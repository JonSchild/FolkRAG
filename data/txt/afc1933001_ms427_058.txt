MASSA'S IN THE COLD GROUND

Round de meadows am a ringing, De darkey's mournful song,
While de mocking bird am singing, Happy as de day am long.

Where de ivy am a creeping, O'ver de grassy mound,
Dere old Massa am a sleeping, Sleeping in de cold, cold ground. 

CHORUS   Down inde cornfield,
Hear dat mournful sound;
All de darkies am aweeping,
Massa's in de cold, cold ground!

When de autumn leaves were falling, When de days were cold,
'Twas hard to hear old Massa calling, Cayse he was so weak and old. 

Now de orange trees are blooming, On de sandy shore, 
Now de summer days am coming, Massa nebber calls no more.

CHORUS -

Massa make de darkies love him, Cayse he was so kind,
Now they sadly weepin above him, Mourning cayse he leave dem behind.

Cannot work before tomorrow, Cayse de tear-drops flow;
I try to drive away my sorrow, Picking on de old banjo.

HO ME, SWEET HOME

'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
A charm from the skies seems to ahllow us there,
Which, seek thro' the world is not met with elsewhere.
Home! home! sweet, sweet home!

An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain;
Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again.
The birds singing gaily that come at my call,
Give me them with the peace of mind, dearer than all.
Home! home! sweet, sweet home!
