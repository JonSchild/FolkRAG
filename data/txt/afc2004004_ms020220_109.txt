BJ TAPE 7A, p. 105

     I was 21 years apart between my daughter and my son.  Ya
see?  An' I prayed to God for chirrun 'cause I was, jus' used to git
peoples chirren, anybody's chirren.  I went to the hospital an'
got babies out a there 9 days old.  An' raise 'em as high as 2
years an' all that.  Two 7 mohths, an' all like that.  An' jus'
keep people's chirrun.  Jes', jes', to have chirren.  'Cause I
wants. . .I loves chirrun.  I always have most respect for a chile.
An' ah so I prayed to God.  There was a seed in my body then,
not to let me die with it in there, ya see?  An' ah, when the
Lord blessed me, I didn't even know it.  Ha, ha. . .
TL:  Oh, really?
BJ:  I didn't believe ['im] it.  I didn' believe it. . .Um-hum.  'Cause that's
the way it be's often times.  The Lawd makes a way for ya an'
he'p ya.  You done asked 'im, but ya jus' [don'] didn' know when it
come, 'cause He comes at the 'pointed time.  He, He comes at the
very time it should, should be.  An' so, tha's why we has to
watch that.
     An' ah, I also taken medicine.  But everything I take,
even now, or anything I put inside, I ask the Lawd to bless it,
ya see?  [An'] When doctors given me medicine, I ask God, if it's His
will, you know, to let it do good.  I'm not dependent on that man,
'cause he just like me.  He's just like I am.  He's just learnt
the scales (skills) of medicine, but he don't know the scales
(skills) of power, ya see.  An' so, 'cause God have all the power,
see?  So that's why, when I go to a doctor, if I have to go to
one, when I make my own medicine, in the her- in the woods, I tell God;
that's his herbs, ya see?  Ya see?  That's His'n; He growed it.
He know every bit about it; know every thing about it.  An' so,
