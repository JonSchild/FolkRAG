In my political science class
the teacher was speaking about draft
evasion. He said that here in D.C.
he had noticed so many young,
healthy looking chaps walking around
in civilian clothes. Yesterday he
happened to run into a former student
of his. He said, "I though you were in
the army and over in Africa!
The former student told him he had
been deferred. The professor told the
former student that he was interested
in this draft evasion & deferrment issue.
The former student quickly changed
the subject and talked about the 
weather.
Another teacher spoke of some
persons who thought they wouldn't have
to go to last war & wondered if the same
type of thing was happening (very satirical)
Two young fellows were talking about
entering the army - one was about to enter &
the one that hadn't been enrolled said "oh me I shan't
be going. I'm going to keep the home fires
burning"
The fellow that entered the army
had gone up to rank of a captain. One day over
in France he noticed an individual who
was struggling up the hill - when the individual
came near enough he recognized him as his friend
who was going to stay home and keep the home fires burning
The captain yelled to struggling individual
who was a private, "attention" and then he said
"at ease" and then the captain said "How
are the home fires?
