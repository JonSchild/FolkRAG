BJ TAPE 3, p. 4

And he had -- at least he had 'em in his hand; he showed 'em to me. Each ticket had a church on it, jus' like a card, ya now. An' each ticket had a church on it. An' there were three churches. An' so, an' he jus' showed me this one an' he showed me that one. An' he held this other'n up to me like that. And I never will forget it. Either church had no name on it, but, until the last one there. The last one he held up an' under -- an' over it -- was "Holy."
Ya see, so I consider then I really had it. Ya see? I -- but hit wasn' that; he was givin' me a message what it is to be, ya see what I mean. But I didn' know then. I considered then I really had it. An' when I jus' -- when I told 'em this 'sperience in the church, I really felt good, ya now. When I told them this, they they jus' knowed that I really did have it, ya see? 'Cause I had somethin' to tell, I really did.
And I went on through but by and by I got weaker and weaker, ya konw, Right back out in the world, doin' the same thing I . . .had been doin'.
AL: Tell me, how'd you. . .How did this vision come to you? When you were out at the praying ground?
BJ: No, I was in my house. An' I had been prayin' in the house, in the kitchen, a long time. Then I laid down across the bed. An' I sittin -- an' ah, an' as I sit up on the side the bed, then I was prayin' again. An' it just seem like, jus' like you go off.  You know, how you go away? Jus' go off like, jus' like you was slumberin'. Well, these things come in and not afraid. Ya jus' see it. He didn't say anything, jus' a tall man came an' showed me them three tickets. An' he jus' went away then. 
I got right on up. . .
