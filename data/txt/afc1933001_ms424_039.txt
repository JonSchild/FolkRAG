Annie Laurie 
(Scotland)

(Page 5 - One Hundred Folk Songs of All Nations)

Maxwelton's braes are bonnie
Where early fa's the dew,
And it's there that Annie Laurie
Gave me her promise true.
Gave me her promise true.
That ne'er forgot will be,
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I'd lay me doon and dee.

Her brow is like the snow-drift,
Her throat is like the swan,
Her face it is the fairest,
That e'er the sun shone on.
That e'er the sun shone on.
And dark blue is her e'e,
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I'd lay me doon and dee.

Aud Lang Syne
(Scotland)

(Page 42 - Old Favorite Songs)

Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, And days of auld lang syne?

Refrain: For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne,
We'll tak' a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne.
