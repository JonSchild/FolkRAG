     . . .                              how would you describe the country to a stranger . . .
it's very        different up here, you know, you're different
from the rest of Alabama and Georgia. What's . . .          special about
it do you think?
     Well, I guess for one thing--we know most of the people around in
this mountain. I know people 20 or 30 miles away from where I live
here who are real good friends of mine. I know most everybody . . .
20 mile area in this part of the country. We just get acquaintedwith 'em
we know nearly everybody around.
     A lot of it happens at the sings, doesn't it?
     Sure, yeah, we meet a people there, Sacred Harp singin'. We meet
people from Mississippi and Texas and Florida and back Georgia and
everywhere . . .                                         singin'. And the places I go to
hunt down in south Alabama and south Georgia, some of my singin' friends,
I've got to stay                             with them to sing, that has big farms
down there.
      . . .
enjoy yourself that way is it?
     For me it's not, for some of 'em it is.
     OK, let's go look at your . . .
     OK.
     . . .

     How long will he run at a time (?) if you let him out . . .
     Well, now, he'll, he'll run when he traces the coon he won't come out,
he stays with it for--he . . .              it in a hole or trees it up a tree . . .
he just stays right in their workin'.
