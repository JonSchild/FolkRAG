the title of the book will be "Consider The
Lilies". One section will be headed "In the 
time of the Lilie."

You will observe that the caption for the 
song illustrated is Eine Lilie = A Lily.

There is an old gentleman living in the 
upper part of Lehigh County, who is quite
a ballad singer. He sings the old 
traditional ballads of the Pennsylvania
Dutch. He has been teaching several
groups to sing these ballads. I had a 
musician visit him and listen to his 
singing. He tells me that his melodies
are pure and strikingly beautiful.

I have taken the words down. I believe
it would worth the while to record his 
rendering of these ballads. If the department 
is interested I will be glad to arrange
for a recording.

Again thanking you for your cooperation 
and help, and with best wishes
