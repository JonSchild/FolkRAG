Mr. William C. Haygood
c/o Julius Rosenwald Fund
490 1 Ellis Avenue
Chicago, Illinois

Dear Mr. Haygood:

When you were in my office a day or so ago you said you had 
a group of applications for recording fellowships. Would it be
feasible to let me examine these projects for a few days while I
am in process of making up the set of recommendations I promised
to send you? In regard to the group of fellowships for the Library
of Congress it might be that I would find a person in your group
who would be well suited for the type of work I am particularly
interested in.

Off the record, does the Rosenwald Foundation consider
applications relating to foreign minority work in the United
States? I have a proposal on my desk from an excellent person in
Wayne University who has developed a very fine center for folk
lore or the minorities in that city. I wondered whether or not to
include it in the fellowship proposal I plan to submit. 

I certainly enjoyed my talk with you. Please come to see me
if you are ever in Washington again.

Sincerely yours,
