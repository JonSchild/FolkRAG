MRS. DAVIS:

LIONEL:
Yeah well I asked you about whether he taught himself all those cords, we talked about that.
LARRY:
Well see, you know like, like something B. Davis told me when it comes to music every thing you got to work out like he said but now if you got a pretty good ear and any other muscian should agree with me, if you got a pretty good ear for music thats well over half the battle. In other words if you could hear you know what I mean, if you could hear the notes coming.
MRS. DAVIS:
7 Couples were married upstairs in our living room different ones. There was one couple came over from Brooklyn it was the funniest thing they had to go back three times to get something for they could get married. I never heard of that. 3 times. they couldn't get themselves together and the witness was here waiting and I say Honey whats the trouble its taking so long when they did come here, they said well we forgot something three times.
