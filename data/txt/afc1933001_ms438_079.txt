He had grown up with Margaret and she admired him. They went
to "plays" and parties and church together. When he was
fifteen, she had a child by him. The community was much upset.
The boys of his own age were jealous of him, the girls fearful
and a little adoring, and the old folks angry and resentful;
[*l.c.*] But Huddie's parents, hoping great things for him, would not
allow him to be forced into an early marriage. He finished school
and went to work on his father's farm. In the meantime Margaret
continued to love him,

and a year later she was again pregnant. Huddie, perhaps grown wiser
in the interval, perhaps in all innocence [rightly], denied that he was [the father] responsible;
but this time the community had turned against him and he left

[finally] At last they ceased to come. After another interval, when Lead Belly had reached
New York and was giving frequent concerts, he wrote again to Dallas, this
time to both A[u]rthur Mae and her mother, saying that if they had
[been more trusting] trusted him more in his time of trouble he [would have] could now
make them rich. He was, in his own words, "jes' jivin' them." Back came
