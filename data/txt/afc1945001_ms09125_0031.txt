they are going to ration cheeze unless it's
because our fighting men need it. 
Mme Chiang Kai - Shek visited New York 
not long ago. She gave speeches hear and 
there and all over. She gave a speech in China 
town also.
Our boys in North Africa are getting along 
fine. They have General Rommel [right 
where they want him] behind the "eight ball."

Guadalcanal. The remaining [Japs] japs (I 
spell japs with no capital, as I here it 
the japs [shood] should be just about extent 
in about five years.)
Rumors have been passed without 
confermation, that there's a possibility 
of 'Hitler' (you know that little [steak] stink
pot) is dead. Maybe.
Our Women are doing alwrite

The Women's Army Axilary Corps) The 
w a v e s (The Women axilary volenteer 
emergency service) "The spars and
