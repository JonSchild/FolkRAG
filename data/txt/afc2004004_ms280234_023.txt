Hand me Down me Petticoat:
1) O hand me down me petticoat
And hand me down me shawl.
Hand me down me petticoat for I'm off to the Linen Hall.
Cho:
He was a quare one, fol-d e-doo-a-berry-dat,
He was a quare one, I'll tell you.

2) If he joins the army I love the old folk's name.
To do me out of me money it9s the old ones are to blame.

3) If you go to the curragh camp,
Just ask for number nine.
You'll get three squatties standing there and the best looking one is mine.

4) If they put him to the war, out to fight the Boers,
With the fire and hell on Dublin's banks,
See the bogmen go before.

5) Me love is o'er the ocean,
And me darling's over the sea.
Me love he was a darling chap, he put me in an awful way.

The British Army:
1) When I was young I used to be
As fine a man as ever you'd see,
Andthe Prince of Wales he says to me,
"Come and join the British Army."
O, tooral-ooral-ooral-co,
There's a lot of monkeys up in the zoo,
And if I had a head like you I'd join the British Army.

2) O Sarah Condon baked a cake,
It was awful poor and slatttery state,
I threw meself into the lake pretending I was barmy.
Tooral-ooral-ooral-oo,
'Twas the only thing that I could do,
For I  could walk home to you and leave the British Army.

The Zoological Gardens:
1) O I've brought my mother up to the zoo,
For to show her the lion and the kangaroo,
But all she wanted to see was the old cockatoo
All inside the Zoological Gardens.
