6. 
There was a boss in our town
And he was wonderous dumb
He tried to answer wage complaints
With jokes and chewing gum.

At last his "docile" workers struck
With union might and main.
He had to grant all their demands
Before they'd work again.

There was an old chiseller
Whose shop was a dump
The ILG got after him--
He didn't know where to jump.

He dodged and he twisted,
And he tried to run away
But the union followed after.
Now fair wages he must pay.
