The Analysis Program:  Reporting

The director of the analysis program, the Research Director, should be <an individual> trained and experienced in social science research.  A combination of psychology and sociology in the background of this person would be best--better than a specialist in only one field or the other.  This combination is desirable because it is sociological analysis that provides the fullest understanding of the conditions under which rumors flourish, and psychological analysis which reveals the implications of such rumors as do appear.  The Research Director should be responsible for the selection and training of field reporters and analysts.  He should also maintain constant supervision over their work.

<It is advisable>

Reporters should be individually selected; a general call for volunteers might arouse too much antagonism among those rejected.  In some cases, however, it may be desirable to request public cooperation in mailing in rumors.  The purpose of such a request is not so much to collect rumors for analysis as to give the public a place to which to refer troubling stories.  The agency should never accept volunteer rumor reports by telephone.  And in asking that rumors be sent in, it should be made clear that they are needed as keys to local information gaps and will not be investigated individually or reported on publicly.  Each rumor should be considered by the directors in the development of the program, but any suggestion of direct counteraction for every rumor should be avoided.
