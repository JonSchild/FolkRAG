Jean: There's money back and front of you. You're going to 
be very lucky for money. There's a lot of luck and prosperity
in front for you. You're going to be a very lucky man. . . . . .
     Now pull out 13 to me. Oh! What a lot of kisses he's
going to get - he's pulled out double cards.
Lomax: If I get money and kisses what else could I need?
Jean: Nothing more - plenty to eat and that's all! You know
a man about your own age, reddish or fair-colored hair. This
man has turned his back on you lately. Do you know a man of
that description you've noticed a change in lately? But you're
going to be in a company where he's going to be in. And there's
a bit of money there. Would there be any money transaction
between you and him? I think he's going to turn again towards
you because they're good cards. There's been a disagreement or
a quarrel, but it's going to blow over. He's facing you there
again with a good heart. . . . You're going to be hearing of an
engagement or getting an invitation to a wedding here. Do you

Lomax: Everyone's getting married but me.

through your work. . . . .It seems to methat you're going to get on
better these next few months than you've been getting on sometime.
You're going to make a come-back fast and sudden here.
Money back and front of you. You have been unlucky lately, but
you're getting over it with the best of hearts. . . . . .
Cut elevn now. . . You're going to be in a big company where that
brown woman is. And it seems you're going to be a bit upset
here. There's a little bit of trouble in your card. Really
upset here, and I wouldna be surprised if you didna get upset
in a company. That's the ten of clubs. And the ace of spades 
means real bad trouble? (Lomax says that last sentence.)
Jean: Yes, when it's turned upside down. That's when you're
going to be upset. But if it was the right way up it would be
