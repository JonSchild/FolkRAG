Dear Spivacke:
       Schinhan has just told me of 
your interest in having me take a recording 
apparatus around South America with 
me, on my folklore trip, to get records of various
types of folklore.  Since I sail next week, I
am afraid, as much as I should like to make 
such records, that the time is now too short 
for me to work out the details of such an 
arrangement with you.  It presents many 
complications:  types of current, customs, breakable
parts, shipping of machine & of records back, etc.
Also, my trip will be a quick broad survey, covering 
the whole continent, except the Caribbean, with short 
stops in many places, getting acquainted with the 
folklorists, their problems & materials. After I have 
once made this introductory survey, then, it seems,
would be the logical time to go back, for intensive & 
careful recording in limited areas, with groundwork of 
plans made previously.  So I hesitate to do what would 
be hasty & probably shoddy work right now. Carnegie gave 
you machines & me a grant on this trip, so you might, at leisure, begin
to interest them in a recording trip for me -- if I survive this one.
                                                         Yours, R S Boggs.
