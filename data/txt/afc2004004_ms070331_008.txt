THE BANKS OF THE LITTLE AUPLAINE
When she heard me say this she fainted,
And  fell at my feet like one dead;
I scooped up a hat-full or water
And threw it all over her head.
She opened her eyes and looked wildly, 
She acted like one that's insane,
I thought to myself she had gone crazy
On the banks of the Little Auplaine.

"My curse be upon you, Ross Campbell,
For taking my Johnnie away;
May the eagles take hold of your body,
And sink it way down in the clay.
May your lumber all go to the bottom,
Ne'er rise to the surface no more;
May all your creeks and your sandbars
Go as dry as the log schoolhouse floor.

"And now I will leave this location,
I'll teach district school no more;
I will go where never, no never,
I will hear the screech of a fifteen-foot oar.
I will go to some far distant country,
To England,  to France, or to Spain,
But I will never forget Johnnie Murphy
Or the banks of the Little Auplaine."
