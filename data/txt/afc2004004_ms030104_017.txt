yonder in my boyhood days
Out yonder in the country, you know,
When I cut my foot on a tin can
Those old folks just believe in Dr. God
They didn' call nobody
They go out yonder an' call Rover
An' take my leg an' hold it right tight
An' let that dog lick my sores.
OOOOOOOOw Yes.
If you're not farin' so sumptuously
But
We believe God'll make everything alright.
And moreover the dog came an' licked his sores
An' God got tired.
An' was standing yonder in Glory
And he walked to the bannister one day
And looked down yonder an' saw Laz'us layin' there
Says "I'm tired,
Of my servan' layin' there (line) I[â€˜ll] believe I'll call him home
I believe I'll call the rich man (line) But before I call him
An' kill him yonder".
OL' Man Dives died
He couldn' even have a funeral
Didn' anybody cry about him
An' he went on down [to] in Hell
An' I can hear him now decla'in'
"Father Abraham"
He will call him
OOOOh Abraham
I want you to have mercy on me
OOOOOOOOOH
I want you to send Laz'us down here
An' dip his finger [in the water]
In the water here
'Cause I'm to'mented in the valley
An' I hear Abraham say
I can't trust my child down yonder
