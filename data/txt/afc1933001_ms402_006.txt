DINK

two-year-old nameless son played in the sand at her feet.
"Do you love this man of yours, Dink" I asked. She scrubbed a
garment vigorously on the wooden washboard, as she answered, "Some of
dese days I'm goin' to take all dat man's clothes an' put 'em in dis
wash tub and get 'em good an' soakin' wet. Then I'm a-goin' to roll up
dese wet clothes in a bundle an' cover 'em up right nice in de middle
uv de bed. Smooth down the covers, an' stick 'em in all 'round de edges.
Den I'm goin' on off up de river." And Dink sang again:
"De worry blues ain' bad, some folks say;
Take a long freight train wid a red caboose to
carry my worry blues away,
When my heart struck sorrow, de tears come -arolling
down,

Suddenly she threw back her head and laughed a joyous, carefree laugh,
and added in different motif and tune:

"All you long-lived skinners better learn how to skin,
For the Louisiana skinners is on the road agin,
Git on the road, git on the road,
Every big nigger got to git on the road.

And then she added:
"Take a long, tall, teasing brown to satisfy my soul."

A few months ago I inquired about Dink at Yazoo City, Mississippi.
"Done planted up there" said a negro woman pointing to a nearby, treeclad,
hill. I could see a few slabs of marble shining through the low
green foliage. Dink [*once*] had sung me [*a*] spiritual about a lonesome graveyard
with the refrain:
"I wouldn't mind dyin', if dyin' was all!"
