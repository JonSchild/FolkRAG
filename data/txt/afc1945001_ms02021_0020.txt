Recently several non-military war emergency offices moved into the Kittredge Building in Denver. It is our understanding that the following agencies are housed in this building: Office of Price Administration, War Relocation Authority, War Production Board, and others.

Complaints have been current for some time that many of these offices are over-staffed; that they are overpaid and that almost every clerk has his own private secretary and luxurious office accommodations. Several times we have been advised that whole carloads of furniture has been sent to these agencies in the Kittredge Building in Denver; that they are supplied with the most modern, efficient and expensive office furniture and equipment. It is the consensus that while the public are anxious to contribute their part in the war effort by buying war bonds, etc., they sometimes question the manner in which this money is being spent and they point to agencies in the Kittredge Building as an example of extravagance and waste; they are firmly convinced that there could be more efficiency and economy in these agencies.
