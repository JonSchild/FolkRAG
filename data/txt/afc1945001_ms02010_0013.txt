        Such a barrage demonstrates, by its very inclusiveness, that this is a
common kind of rumor, indiscriminately applied; that the particular rumor is
just another version of another rumor; and that all rumors of this character
are to be mistrusted. Listing hate-rumors about different groups en masse
helps to expose the basic strategy and fallacy of hate-rumors.
       The rumor-control project can perform a significant service by making
people aware that in spreading hate-rumors they are playing into the hands of the
enemy's strategy of "Divide and Conquer"; those people who repeat rumors about
any racial, religious, or social group in this country are--whether they mean
it or not, whether they know it or not--playing into the enemy's hands.
       Hate-rumors present a continuing danger to democracy's war-effort. One
necessary answer to hate-rumors lies in widespread community campaigns designed
to attack the sources of hate, to expose the prejudices whicn lead to hate-
rumors, and to blanket hate-rumors with energetic information programs. [*?on page 3*]

Advisory Services for Projects

        Owing to the complexity and delicacy of the tasks confronting a rumor control                
project, it is most important for the rumor-control project to seek the
guidance and cooperation of a competent Advisory Board. This Board should include 
responsible community officials; representatives of civil and service clubs,
women's organizations, labor and farm groups, consumer groups, minority groups
in the community, technical experts (from the psychology or sociology department
of local colleges or universities), [*????*] and newspaper and radio representatives.
        The analysis of rumors will often point to imperfections in real conditions
in the community. Persistent rumors about housing conditions, for example, may
simply be the direct result of poor housing. [*??*] The improvement of the housing
