plaster a house at 25 --
his mot. uncle came from
Comoca at 16 to fight - a tough little
Frenchman - captured
with a ball in shoulder
- those Southern sons of 
bitches kept him in prison
for 13 mos. treated them
terrible - wanted them
to die - hardly fed
them - when he was
exchanged - ball
extracted, - was back in 
his regiment right
