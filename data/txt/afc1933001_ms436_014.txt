I come back for my suit, that guy drew a baseball bat on me.  You wouldn't 
believe there were such dirty people in the world, would you?  Well, there
I was with an old [dirty ragged suit] striped suit, dirty and ragged.  After
a year's work on the stage, I didn't have nothing but an old trombone.  But 
I didn't care.  I sung my Winding Ball and My Alabama Bound and started 
 West, hunting pool tables and suckers where they told me plenty of pianos 
and plenty women had been broken hearted all their lives waiting for some 
real high jive.
"Lovin' babe if you just must go,
Leave me a dime for beer."
