you bought them, Yalmer
would wish if you'd send him
a double Reedd Key of C- or G. mouth organ
he'd appreciate it a million times,

Best regards from Abo and
Forster family. Lynasti ja ole

Yours very truly
Forster family,

Remember to Answer
Good Bye. Hyasti
Best regards from Abo, his got
new girl friend
