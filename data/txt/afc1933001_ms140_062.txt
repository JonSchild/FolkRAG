Dear Alan Lomax:

          I am sorry the intervening silence has been so
long that you started to get worried about your records.
have been back now about ten weeks, but we did not get any
of my records finally delivered here until about ten days
ago.   I am seeing to it now that you will have them within
the next few days.

         I want very much to come down to Washington soon for
various reasons: first, to thank you more warmly and person-
ally than U was able to do in the spring for lending me the 
records; secondly, I want to meet your father.   I have a 
good many press clippings here about my series, which had 
an astonishingly interested reception in British Isles. 

         I hope these pressings are still good enough to take
the place at least of the aluminum masters.

        Hoping to see your some time within the next two months, 

                                                                Cordially, 
                                                                       [Alislain Coolle]
