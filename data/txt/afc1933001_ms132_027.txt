Acting Chief, division of Music,

Washington, D. C. 

Dear Doctor Spivacke:

I wish to thank you, and Mr. Alan Lomax, for your courtesy with respect to the rough draft of the story I sent in some time ago. I have been absent from the city, or would have made acknowledgement sooner.

As I said - or should have said - in transmitting this draft, it was as to form nothing other than facts thrown together in such way as to furnish, for my purpose, a kind of sequence, and to get data together so as to make unnecessary further reference to authorities.

The suggestion of Mr. Lomax, as to not mentioning "reports" so often was, of course, pertinent, I had in glancing over the draft, after sending it, been conscious of the need for this. I'm going to try shortly to develop it into a story in acceptable form.

Yours very sincerely,
Lee Lamar Robinson
