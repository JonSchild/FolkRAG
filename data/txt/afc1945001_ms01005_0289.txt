Oil News Editor Hits
FBI Probe of Rumors

  CLEVELAND, Nov. 17 (P). -- Warren 
C. Platt, editor of the National
Petroleum News, declared today an
FBI investigation into origin of reports 
of a second postponement
Nation-wide gasoline rationing is "a
Gestapo-like operation" and a "palpable 
effort to subvert the people's
right to petition their Government."
  His declaration to a Cleveland reporter 
came after the regional Office
of Price Administration here said it
wanted to know what was back of a
furry of false rumors, current in
Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago and
other Midwestern cities, that there
would be a second postponement.
The regional Office of War Information 
announced the FBI was attempting
to learn the sources of
these reports.
  Mr. Platt declared such rumors
are really Nation-wide protests
against the compulsory rationing
program, adding:
  "Ever since it was announced that
rationing would go into effect there
have been vigorous protests against
rationing, because it is the conviction 
of many experts that it is not
only unnecessary, but inimical to the
national welfare * * *
  "Now the OPA and the FBI propose 
to shut off these protests by
branding them as rumors and reports, 
and the cunning inventions of
enemy agents and saboteurs. This
is a Gestapo-like operation, and we
want none of it in America. If the
FBI wants to bring its ridiculous
manhunt to a quick and successful
conclusion it can come to my office
and I will give it the facts."
  Mr. Platt said he did not mean by
this that he knew anything about
origin of reports that rationing
definitely would be postponed, but
"what we're trying to do is to fix it
so that you don't have to get a certificate
every time you brush your 
teeth. There are a lot of people who
still will bet that Nation-wide gasoline 
rationing doesn't go through."
