After you're canzo wonsi , all the loi come sleep with you.  She likes it but her husband is jealous.  She likes her husband as well or better than loi because he paid for the three nightgowns, the drinks, etc., necessary to complete the ceremony.  She sleeps with Papa Legba, who loves young girls esp., and she has felt his beard on her belly. Damballa is jealous, comes Thursday and Saturdays. Agwe is not jealous and comes Fridays.  Most are not jealous and she leaves no special nights for them, but her husband get livid at her going about to so many dances.
