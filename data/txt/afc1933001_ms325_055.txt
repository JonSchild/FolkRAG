An Impression of a Saturday Session at the
CITY BOOK AUCTION
----------
THE AUCTIONS SALE is one of the most fascinating phases of modern
methods of barter and trade. Within the portals of the auction-room one
will find Find Press and First Edition enthusiasts, Autograph specialists,
Americana lovers and the rest of the selected crew of collectors, waiting
for the opening call. The affable auctioneer, in high state, is the cynosure
of all eyes. His echoing "What am I bid?" is the sacred chant familiar to 
all; while his "Sold" finale is sweet music to the successful buyer, but
sudden sorrow to the underbidder.

Lady Bibliophilia regularly holds court every Saturday afternoon at the
CITY BOOK AUCTION, dispensing literary treasures to her faithful
following. At any one of her command performances one may see an
embryonic HOE, the future HUNTINGTON, a disciple of that philosopher-
booklover EDWARD NEWTON, as well as the veteran bibliophile,
all on edge, seeking to add a rarity to their collections. The bidding is
spirited and the rivalry keen - for at no other place than in the auction-
room is the opportunity presented to acquire the prizes of the printed pages,
of all ages, in open and unrestricted, competitive bidding.

As works of esteemed authors, famous artists and typographers are brought
to the light of day, as it were, the occasion is presented anew to obtain for
one's own delight and possession the long desired rare Americana, sporting
print, or some choice impression of the printer's art.

Each weekly dispersal of desirable collector's items is heralded through
the printed catalogue. Here, in word pictures, are revealed to the seasoned
bibliophile, as well as to the neophyte-collector, a choice binding, a pristine
print, the artist's original drawing or sketch, the cherished holograph letter
or manuscript. Their catalogue descriptions are learned, lucid and leave
the imprint of an expert who has mastered all the fine points of bibliographic
lore.

"BOOKS AND BIDDERS" has been made famous in the book collecting
world by the greatest bibliophile of modern times, DR. ROSENBACH,
who sells his treasures to those with padded purses. This popular phrase
is likewise the clarion call of BEN ROSENZWEIG, who auctions off
collectors' tidbits to the many of the "Minor League" of booklovers, at his
CITY BOOK AUCTION ROOM.
