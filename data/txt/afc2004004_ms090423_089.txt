visits until late October because the people worked so late in the cotton 
picking season that it was hard to have them assemble before 9:30 or 10 
o'clock. He suggested that we contact Mr. Vickery who had been the A.A.A. 
administrator in the county for seven years. Mr. Vickery, he thought knew 
the county better than any one else. 

Mr. Vickery is now manager of the S. H Kyle plantation where an 
experimental program is planned for the coming year. Mr. Kyle is president 
of the Coahoma County Farm Bureau. Mr. Vickery suggested these plantations      
the Kind and Anderson plantation which had been in the possession of the 
Andersons since it was cleared and placed in cultivation. He said that much 
of the old tradition would be found there. Young Mr. Anderson is willing 
to allow us access to the plantation.    

The Hopson plantation which is highly mechanized. Professor 
Stone, who has taught the school on the Hopson plantation was found in
the field picking cotton. He was interested in our plans and offered assistance. 
He accompanied me to see the bookkeeper to whom I explained the 
project. Mr. H. H. Hopson, Jr. was ill and couldn't be seen but the bookkeeper 
said he would explain the project to him when he visited him. The 
bookkeeper is a native of Murfreesboro, Tennessee and knew about Fisk. He 
and Professor Stone were sure that free access to the plantation would be 
given. The bookkeeper said that Mr. Hopson wouldn't want us on the plantation 
during the cotton picking season but when cotton picking was over he 
would be welcome. I am to write Mr. Hopson when we are ready to begin. 

The Sherrod plantation. Mr. Vickery said it would be interesting 
because there is everything there from oxen to tractors. He said Mr. Sherrod
would understand and be sympathetic to the undertaking.
