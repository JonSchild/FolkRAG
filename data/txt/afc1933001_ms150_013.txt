My dear Mr. Lomax:

Just now, I met the man and saw the manuscript you
could use advantageously in your project. There is a
lively, 82-year-old lumberjack by name of George Lutman
who has his reminiscences written out.

Lutman was a "boss", and has had much logging experience
around Traverse City in the Lower Peninsula and around
St. Ignace in the Upper Peninsula.    His address is
332 W. Ninth Street, Traverse City, Mich.    He will be 
pleased to hear from you and can aid you. He is a bit
suspicious; so feel free to say that Dr. Beck suggested
that you write him. 

Possibly the Federal Writer's Project would want
to publish his work.    At all events here is a jack
worth your contacts.

Hurriedly,
EC Beck
