CONCERNING THE MUSIC IN THIS BOOK

I half wonder why I wrote out the music for these songs,
because for the most part the folks that will like the songs
best will be folks that can't read a note. But don't be
bashful; just slam away at the old tune as best as you can,
and if you don't hit the right note, why, who's to say that
the one you hit isn't as good as the one you didn't?

[Outside of the well-known tunes] The tunes, outside of old
familiar favorites which have been printed elsewhere, were
transcribed from phonograph records, commercial, or privately
made. Most [tune] of the tunes are straight old American folksongs,
as pure as they come, and some are modern popular songs.
