Gallery

The paintings and sculpture on these pages are from re-
cent and current shows at this Gallery, which is a center
of artistic activity in New York. The director, Herman
Baron, is not content to hang merely the well-known
painters who are his regular exhibitors, but is constantly 
seeking new talent. Seven years ago, Joe Jones was one
of his discoveries. 

JOE JONES, whose paintings appears at the right, as well
as in the lower left-hand corner, opens his show at the
A. C. A. this month. His new work is inspired by the rail-
road yards and housing conditions of his native St. Louis.
he is rapidly becoming a master of realistic painting.

DE HIRSH MARGULES, whose water-colors brought
the East Coast into the A. C. A. last month, has been active
in the artistic life of both Paris and New York. His paint-
ing below and on the opposite page show great sophisti-
cation, or rather refinement of color, which also distin-
guishes his more abstract compositions.
