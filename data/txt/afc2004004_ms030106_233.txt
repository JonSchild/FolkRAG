From J.R.
196
Freddie Keppard - greatest hot trumpeter in existance- more numbrous
ideas- lowest and highest notes in history- very fine fellow when he wasn't
drinkin', always after goodlookin women- spent every dime he could get - died
broke in Chicago.  Had the first Dixieland Combination- piano, clarinet, trumpet,
trombone, and drums around 1908.  It was created by the place they worked-
business got bad, had seven pieces- bass violin, viol drum, guitar, trombone,
trumpet, and clarinet.  On Franklin Street between Custom House and Brenville,
big dance hall in tenderloin district... had to cut two pieces instead of cut
off three and stuck in a piano with Buddy Christian- fair pianist- no good
piano player would fake a job like that- reason, J.B. quit guitar.  F.K. was
working for $1 a night- the lower classes went to the dance halls, all the
rich trade went to sporting houses.  These places had 4 or 5 parlors and
you could go from one to the other.
     There was a Blue Book with all the information about the Tenderloin
District.  J.R.'s name is still in this book.  They call it the N.O. guide now.
