Not Sacred Harp.
Why?
Well, it just don't go good
The way the books are written, the notes are far apart, and a person
playin' the instrument can't read all four lines at the same time, so
far apart, you can't see it.
The sound--does it sound right to play on the piano?
If you know how to play it. But if, it's just harder--you can't
read it . . . and there's a lotta minor music in, in there and . . .
what makes it even harder to play on an instrument.
So you all think Sacred Harp is on a comeback trail a little bit
huh?
I believe so.
What do you think Carnis?
Yes, I do.
Well, that's mighty fine. I'm happy. . . .
