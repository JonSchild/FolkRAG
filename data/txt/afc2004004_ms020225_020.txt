[*Selling out to the Devil for Music
(incl Good Story)*]
AL:  There's something I've heard; you could probably tell me
it's true; that some of these great guitar pickers really got
their music from the devil?
BJ:  Yeah, a lot of 'em did, um-hum.  But sometime God give you a gift...
AL:  They'd have to go into some kind of a charm or sumpin'
like that.
BJ:  Yeah, some kinda mess that way, um-hum.  Sell theyse'f out to
the devil.  But, um, some...
AL:  You've heard this story, too?
BJ:  Yeah, I've heard that many times.
AL:  Did they have to meet the devil?
BJ:  Yeah, meet the devil.  I don't know... God!  I can meet
'im without that!  But I...
AL:  No, but I mean, they'd have to make...
BJ:  They had to do sumpthin' to, ah, to git in touch with the
devil's spirit.  Sell theyself out.  An'...
AL:  Can you tell me a tale about how that would...?
BJ:  Aw, you got one on the tape, here.  I think I tol' ya --
I'm sure I tol' ya 'bout how [this] Mr. McGillis tol' about, about
how he had to meet the devil at the crossroads.  He had to meet
-- go to the crossroads an' [cross] curse God.
AL:  No, but that wasn't to get music, was it?
BJ:  Yes, it was.  I mean, ah, I mean, you know, to do any thing.
To git music or be a doctor or whatnot.  Anything ya wanna do,
he say, anything.
AL:  But somebody told me that you'd have to go there several
different times.  And then, when he was gonna make you a guitar
player, he would do something special to you.  Do you know what
it was?
