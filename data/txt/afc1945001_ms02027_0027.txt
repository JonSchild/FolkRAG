Rumor Report. 

Enclosed is my belated collection of rumors. 
My Labor contact, who is president of the Allison union, is still out 
of the city, and his returns will not reach me until tomorrow at which time I 
will immediately forward them to you. 

I am also enclosing a letter received from the Secretary of the Salvage 
Program in Indiana regarding the burial of Government equipment. In this 
connection, similar rumors are slowing up the salvage collection campaign in Indiana. 
State Salvage officials inform me that a number of their County 
Chairmen refuse to push the drive in the face of similar rumors at Camp Atterbury, 
Fort Benjamin Harrison and CCC camps over the state.

Also, I am enclosing a clipping from the Indianapolis Star for October 
fourth which describes the meeting of the Republican Editorial Association at 
French Lick. The statement I have marked is being used right along by GOP 
orators in these parts. It is a serious detriment to War Bond sales. 

In addition, I am enclosing the latest literary effort of Carl H. Mote, 
millionaire Indiana telephone executive. I know you are busy but I wish you 
would take a few minutes to read it. Mote has been called to testify before 
Congressional Committees on a number of ocassions regarding his writings.
