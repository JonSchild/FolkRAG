Wendover, Utah
August 3: Most of the business men are trying to get all they can out of
this war effort. I am in the service station business and I thought that I
was a good patriot by turning in all my tires when tire rationing started, but
my competitors had all new tires on their cars as well as those of their 
friends several weeks after rationing took effect. Unless our business' men
realize that they have to get back of this war effort, we are going to take
an awful licking.
