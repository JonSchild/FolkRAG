Dear Rae,

Please thank Mr. Korson for his generous response to
my request for permissions. I do hope to hear from him some
time about Joe Brown's Coal Mine. Meantime I am writing a
note abou the present size of the [Li] Archive collection.
Could you tell me the latest count in terms of numbers of
songs and(or) numbers of discs and tapes---the areas
covered---with a note about what percentage of these songs
which do not come from the USA, itself.. I'll include this
information in my new book.

All the best
Alan Lomax

PS. Sometime ago I sent Harold Spivacke a request
for the photostats of a few songs from old books of
white spirituals. I received the [pictures of] songs
out of the Sacred Harp, which is a modern edition and
available almost anywhere, but none of the other material
from other older books which are obtainable nowhere
but in the Library of Congress. I note that the check
I sent has been paid through my bank, but as yet I have
heard nothing further about this matter. It seems to me
that the request for these photostats was not an unreasonable
one, and might have been more thoroughly and, perhaps,
more gently responded to. Would you be kind enough 
to bring the matter up with the [person] proper person in
the music division?
