Oughta be like me,
YOu oughta be like me,
You could ride all around this whole round world,
An' let yo' woman be.

Why doncha be like me?
Why doncha be like me?
Make out wid whiskey, drink yo' beer,
An' let yo' women be.

Nineteen thirty-fo'
Was a bran' new year,
Nineteen an' thirty-five
Is another year.

Alabama bound,
Alabama bound,
If I don' sink or turn around',
I'm Alabama boun'.
