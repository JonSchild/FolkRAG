(Carl) The prairie Creoles organized Jayhawker bands.  Thes
were paramilitary units that resisted both Confederate
conscription units and Union units that were sent out to t
prairies to round up cattle that belonged to the French
settlers there.  The Jayhawker units, by the end of the Civi
War, also included a number of free blacks, who were also
resisting Confederate conscription.  A number of free black
were supposed to be conscripted into a forced labor unit an
be sent up to north Louisiana.  (AL ques. unint.)  Most of
them. . .Fano(?) was the most common  of the surnames among the
troups that had served in the French colonial garrison.  Th
were a number of others, there were Lucats, and Brignants a
and Bonants(???) drawn from that area.  The leader of the
Jayhawk element was a Jose Mecadier(?), who, according to
the 1860 census, cohabitated with two free black mulatto
women.  This may account in part for the acceptance of the 
band for. . .
AL:  So now you have this prairie area literally peppered with
communities of different backgrounds and color
Carl:  and culture, that's right.  This area, the one sandwiche
between the prairie Creole communities, the prairie Acadian
communities and the free black communities--this area, where
the three areas overlapped constitues the real cultural
melting pot in Southwest Louisiana.
AL:  As I define it as an anthropologist, this is where Africa,
Europe, and Amerindia really got together, and pooled their
interests and made a new culture.
