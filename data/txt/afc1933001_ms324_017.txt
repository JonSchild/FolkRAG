SINGING GAMES

Mary Catherine Stealey of Clarksburg, West Virginia, wrote down these two
games, after watching the West Virginia mountaineers play them. While these dances
are performed elsewhere, the versions given here are West Virginian and may differ
somewhat from those used elsewhere.

     Three Little Blue Birds
Three little blue birds sitting in a window,
Sitting in a window, sitting in a window,
Three little blue birds sitting in a window,
Old Virginia style.

Take a little hop and swing your lover,
Swing your lover, swing your lover,
Take a little hop and swing your lover,
Old Virginia style.

The formation for this game is a circle with three girls in the center. During
the first verse the three girls choose partners. As suggested in the second verse
they "take a little hop and swing your lover." Then as the song begins once more
the girls step out, and the boys repeat the same process. Amusement is sometimes
added by the boys singing such words as "buzzards" or "devils" as substitutions for
"bluebirds."
