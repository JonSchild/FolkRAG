Rumor heard between two housewives in Denver, on August 4: "I just got a letter from a friend of  mine in California. I guess things are pretty bad out there because everything is so dry. From what I can understand they are afraid that the Japs are going to invade the West Coast and drop incendiary bombs. People out there are filling their bathtubs and every other kind of container so they will have plenty of water available if any fires start. I guess everybody on the West Coast is scared to death. I am glad I live in Colorado." [*24*]
