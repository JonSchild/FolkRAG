Reel of 10/4/61, Side 2, Song 19
ROCK FROM SIDE TO SIDE   37
Back in the olden days, they sang this to the little children to
teach them to stay humble; whatsoever happened, to stay and rock,
from side to side, because they were toiling from one mean trick
to another and from one undermining thing to another.  The song
means don't boast about it, don't worry about it, just stay in the
humble chair and rock from side to side, because we know that one
day Jesus will make a way.  If they push you this way, rock the
other way, just keep moving and stay humbl, that's what it meant...
It is a ring game. One gets in the middle of the ring and sings:
I'm gonna sit in the arm chair,
I'm gonna rock from side to side,
I'm gonna rock from side to side
'Till I die.
My sister, come in the arm chair,
Yeah, rock from side to side,
Just rock from side to side,
'Till I die.
The sister of the one in the center joins him and they sing:
Miss Loulla, come in the arm chair,
And rock from side to side,
Just rock from side to side,
'Till I die.
Loulla joins them in the center and they sing:
Brother Robert, come in the arm chair, etc.
Robert joins them in the center and they sing:
Everybody, get in the arm chair, etc.
Anybody who wants to may come into the center, and they sing faster
and faster, rocking in the center until everybody is rocking and
singing:
Yes, I'm gonna stay in the arm chair, etc.
