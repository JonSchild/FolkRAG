Fisk, 22. 6.

Christians, good singing Christians at that time and was until they
died.  Why, if anybody sang and prayed in the house, my daddy would
do it, too.  And if my Auntie Russie was there with her Gus she'd sing
and pray and start us all off.  That's the way they did.

A:  You're happy?

W:  Yes.  Happy.

Rock Daniel.

She'd just sing -- 

Lord, Lord, rock Daniel,
Lord, Lord, rock Daniel,
Lord, Lord, rock Daniel,
Oh, my Lord, rock Daniel.

Then they'd go rocking and a rocking and shaking hands, rocking and
a shaking hands.  Now what they do, I don't know.

A:  Did that happen in the church-house?

W:  In the old house where they'd have meetings, yes.  They had no
church.

A:  When would that happen?  All during the week or just on Sundays?

W:  Oh, on Sundays when they'd go to church -- Wednesday nights when
they'd go to prayer-meetings.

A:  Right along with the service?

W:  Oh, yes.  They's sing that right along with the service.  After the
preacher would go on, then the sisters would all sing.  Sho, that's
the way they done.

A:  Did you ever hear them sing "'Twixt a He and a She Rock Daniel"?

W:  No, I never heared that (laughter).  No, I didn't hear that, I tell
you.
