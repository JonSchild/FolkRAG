Dear Mrs. Wilson:
I enclose a letter concerning 
your program which 
I trust may be helpful to
 you in securing a [?] of 
your interesting group of negroes. 
I hope you wont mind a 
few suggestions from me:

1. The tune used in the crap 
shooting beginning does not seem to me 
[out of harmony] negro music 

2. Some of [the tunes] your Spirituals 
[your ?] are widely sung. Why 
not include only those peculiar to your section?

3. Your audiences will generally be 
far more interested in the 
primitive elements of the 
singing that in the beauty and 
finish of the program.
