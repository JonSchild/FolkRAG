AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL
(Page 70 - Y. W. C.A. Song Book)

O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain,
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain.
America!  America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown they good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.

O beautiful for pilgrim feet
Whose stern impassioned stress
A thoroughfare for freedom beat
Across the wilderness.
America!  America!
God mend thine every flaw,
Confirm thy soul in self-control
Thy liberty in law.

O beautiful for glorious tale
Of liberating strife,
When valiantly for man's avail
Men lavish precious life.
America!  America!
May god thy gold refine
Till all success be nobleness
And every man divine.

O beautiful for patriot's dream
That sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam
Undimmed by human tears.
America!  America!
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea.
