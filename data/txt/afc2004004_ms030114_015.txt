Willie Trice remebers Gary in Durham in 1932, but he wasn't ling
there then
     By 1935 Gary had moved to Durham N.C.  At this time Sonny
Terry, Bull City REd, Richard and Willie Trice, as well as other
musicians were living.  Soon Blind Boy Fuller moved in there and 
stayed with Terry For a while.  They would all hang out at Sonny
Terry's house, cause, according to Terry, he was "a big boot-legger".
Sonny Terry told me a story about Gary.  Gary was receiving
a disability pension from the state, and some government
man came to ask Gary why he wasn't working in the local
blind people's factory (where, incidentally, Terry was then
working)  GAry replied by showing the man his hands and saying
this was how he earned his living, and he wasn't going
to get his hands meesed up in any factory.
     There is some dispute as to whether or not Gary taught
Fuller anything on guitar, and if so, how much.  Admitting to
being partial, it appears to me that Gary did.  (Gary says he 
did, Fuller claimed the opposite0  It certainly must be admitted
that Gary has a much more developed style, and that it seems
less likely that Gary would have learned from Fuller.  Willie T
TRice stated that Fuller learned the key of A from Gary.
      Fuller had begun recording, and in 1935, he, Gary, Terry,
Bull City Red, and J.B. Long , a Carolina agent for the Perfect
Record Company drove to N.Y.C. for a recording session.  Gary
had recently gotten a steel guitar (according to Willie, Gary
was the first one to get a steel guitar), and Long like the 
sound of it, So they stopped in Richmond, Va. and Long bought
Fuller a National Steel just like Gary's.
