CONGRESS CONSIDERING
FIVE-DAY WEEK BILL

SIGN PETITION!

CONGRESSMEN TO SPEAK
AT MASS MEETING
FEBRUARY 17

The UFWA has gone to Congress 
this session to get a five-day
week. This and the appeals bill
of Congressman Bigelow which provides 
for the establishment of an 
automatic system for the appeal
of grievances are the first steps 
which the UWFA has taken toward 
the realization of its twelve-
point legislative program for 
federal workers. Much depends on 
its success. Its success, in
turn, depends, in a considerable
measure, upon whether or not we
are willing to take seriously the
proposition that we must personally
--individually--help secure
congressional support for it. The
Bill was introduced by Representative
McCormack of Massachusetts
who was so successful in the establishment
of the present five
and a half day week. We are most
fortunate in securing his services.
But congress as a whole
is not likely to act if the workers
themselves remain sluggish
and indifferent. Congress acts
for those who exert most pressure
upon it. That means letters, telegrams,
petitions. A petition is
now circulating in all the government
departments. If a petition
does not find you, you find it.
It's worth it.
If you are a District resident
and have no representative to
write to, write to Congressman McCormack.
Perhaps the point to
make on the five-day week bill is
that it is a great step toward
making the government the model
employer it should be. Industry,
in numerous cases, has already
established a five-day week. The
government should have led the
way, but since that is now impossible,
it should follow.
If you write to your congressman
don't confine yourself to the
wage week bill (HR8731), the minimum
wage bill for government employees
providing for the establishment
of the $1260 minimum and
a corresponding raise to $1500
for those who now receive that
salary. Let them know we need it.
It will be a practical bill, much
more carefully drafted than any
of the previous bills. You will
not need to appeal from the point
of view of making the government
a model employer in this instance
The appeal should be for at least
a subsistence wage. Not one worker
in twenty can make his present
wage stretch from one pay day to
the next. Many of them need to
save for schooling, or for homes.
On the $1260 salary there is no
one who finds it possible to save
anything. That fact is eloquent.
Congressmen should know about it.
It's up to you.
The UFWA, as in an entire organization,
is making preparations for
a giant mass meeting of the government
workers in all departments,
to be held on the night of
February 17, the familiarize them
as a whole with the legislative
program that the UFWA is pressing
in their interest. The congressmen
who are sponsoring the several
bills will be the speakers.
The more important bills to be
considered deal with the five-day
week, the appeals system, increased
pay for overtime, and a minimum
wage for government employees
Among the speakers will be Congressman
Robert Ramspeck of Georgia,
William D. Bulow, Chairman
of the Senate Civil Service Committee,
Congressman Bigelow who
is sponsoring the appeals bill,
Congressman McCormack, sponsor
of the five-day week bill, and
possibly Congressman Lewis Schwellenbach
who is working on the
minimum wage bill.
