As Turpin rode in search of prey 
He met an exciseman on the way 
When boldly he did bid him stand 
Your gold he said I do demand. 

To that the exciseman did reply 
Your proud demands I must deny 
Before my money you receive 
One of us two shall cease to live 

Turpin then without remorse 
Soon knocked him quite from off his horse 
And left him on the ground to sprawl 
So off he rode with his gold & all. 

An usurer as I am told 
Who had in charge a sum of gold 
With a cloak was clouted from side to side 
Just like a palmer he did ride 

And as he jogged along the way 
He met with Turpin that same day 
With hat in hand most courteously 
He asked him for charity
