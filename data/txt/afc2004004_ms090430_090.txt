There is an excess of marriageable females over males, and more
divorced and widowed women than men. Aside from the differential sex migration
suggested, other factors seem to enter into this pattern. Couples
do not marry at as early ages, women defer marriage for greater guarantees
of security, and there is a definite attitude, notably among the younger
people, favoring smaller families.

Occupational Division of Population

Farming, in which 24.2 per cent of the Negro families are engaged,
consists primarily of the growing of corn, hay, truck farming and combinations
of corn and hay and corn and truck. Eighty per cent of the farm families
raise these items. Some grow corn exclusively, but the majority raise
two or more crops, including oats, wheat, potatoes, sorghum, tobacco, and
many of them combine with their produce livestock, poultry and dairy products.

The amount of farm ownership is small. Only 3.9 per cent are 
farm owners. There are more farm laborers than farm tenants. From the beginning
of 1929 to 1935 there is evidence of a general decline in all classes
of occupations. Both farm owners and tenants lost their farms or were forced
to abandon them. Some found it expedient to retrench and farm on a smaller
scale. The relief rolls register considerable unemployment in agriculture.

The largest farm under cultivation by Negro farmers in 1929 was
160 acres. In 1935 the largest farm being worked by a Negro was between 80
and 90 acres. Thirty-six families which were cultivating farms in 1929 with
an acreage of less than 10 increased to 53 by 1935. (1) Farm acreage decreased
markedly for the whole group. This change in agriculture has been accompanied
