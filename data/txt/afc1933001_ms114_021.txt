Dearest Alan & Elizabeth,
I am enclosing the list of
records which I will mail
tomorrow (the records, I mean. Sentences
like this one always 
confuse me.)  Anyway, as far
as I can remember, only 2
sets of records are missing.
Sergei seems to have Brahm's
First; I don't know how it
got to Dallas but anyway -
And I'm sure we used to
have the Sonata Pathetique
by Beethoven.
