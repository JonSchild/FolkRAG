Dear Dr. Horowitz:

Your work in the Bureau of Intelligence
sounds very interesting. Unfortunately, I don't
have a copy of the report on our Rumor survey
to which you refer.

This article has been submitted to
the Journal of Applied Psychology and should
appear in August.

If you will notice from the 
letterhead, I have left the Committee for National
Morale and am back at the University of Southern
California.

To date I have had a number of comments
from people who received the Social Science
Research Council memorandum on Public Opinion,
but as yet there has been no demand for the
coordination of efforts.

Enclosed herewith are two reprints
which you may find interesting.

Sincerely yours,
Floyd L. Ruch
