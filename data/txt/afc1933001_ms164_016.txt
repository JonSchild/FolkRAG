December 11, 1940

Dear Allan:

Ada and I want to arrange a 
party one evening just after the first
of the year with Leadbelly down from
New York. Do you think we could get
shold of him and, if we could, would
you and your wife care to come too?
We thought we'd just have an evening
of hell-raising on the geetar.

Yours,
[?]
