Dear Mr. Lomax:
In reply to your letter of August 27, I say that I
shall be glad to cooperate with you in every way
in the work which you outlined in your letter. I
think there are several old fiddlers and singers in
this county in whom you will be interested. I shall
look forward to your coming and in the meantime will
be on the lookout for the type of people you
will wish to see.
Very truly yours.
J.F. Williams
John Fred Williams, Supt.,
