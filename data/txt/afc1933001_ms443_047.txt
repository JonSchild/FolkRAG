went to the sher[r]if, Nex' thing I knowed de dog boy was shakin' 
me an' sayin', Come on, Walter, let's go back to de 
camp. 
"I tell him, 'Keep those dogs offa me.' De dogs was all aroun' 
an' wantin' to bite me, but he hit one wid a stick an' knock him 
back; den he say, 'Come on, Walter, le's go.' Well, I didn' 
want to go an' I tole him, 'Naw, -----, I ain' goin' back 
to dat place no mo'.' De white man threw his pistol down on me 
an' say, "Get up there an' walk, you damn n----- or i'll shoot you. So I gets up 
an' I walk on away from dem. Didn' pay no 'tention to de gun. 
Didn' care. He holler, 'Come on, back here, n------, or I'll shoot 
your black heart right outa yuh." But I didn' pay him no min'. 
I wasn' goin' back. I walked on out in de lake, right up to 
my neck, fell over backward in de water an' tried to 
drown myself. Look like I could feel de water cuttin' off 
my win' like stran's o' bob-wire [cuttin'] cross my ches' higher 
an' higher to my neck....
     "But dey wasn' gonna let me down. Dey pull me out an' turn me 
up side down an' squeeze de water outa me. Look like I swallowed 
de whole lake, water was runnin' outa ev'y hole. I could feel 
de like comin' back to me slow an' de dog-boy say, "Walter, how yo ufeel?"
I tried to say sumpin but I couldn' make no soun'. I lay dere right still an' 
feel de life comin' back all over. De dog-boy say again, "Walter
can you go now? 'I tried to tell him I wasn' ready to go yet, 
but look like I couldn' say no word, jes' could make a soun' 
wid my throat, "Krlrug."
