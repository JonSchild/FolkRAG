THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
To: Dr Botkin  Date: 9-10-43
Please tell Mr. 
Lomax in a personal 
letter that the Library 
doesn't accept responsibility 
for Dr. Brown's statements in 
the book.
you may add any information 
you have about the error in the 
lines of the song. I think you might
well say that Lomax's attribution 

From: LUTHER H. EVANS, Chief Assistant Librarian

of motive to Brown in the chain gang
business seems to you far fetched.
