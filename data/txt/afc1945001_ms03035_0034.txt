Blood Bank
A stenographer in the offices of the Georgian Bay Navigation
Company, Detroit:
"On August 5 I was told, but I can't remember by whom: 'All
this talk about blood not requiring typing before being donated to the
Red Cross blood bank was started in an effort to stop the distinctions [*5*]
being made between the plasma of white and colored persons. If blood
isn't typed and colored blood is transfused into a white, the whites soon
will become almost extinct, which is the wish of the Japanese. They
could then come in and have a race of dark-skinned people to deal with.'"
The same informant was told in another quarter August 8, but
doesn't recall the source:
"These blood banks we have been hearing about so much lately
are a farce. How can they ever hope to heal anyone by transfusions if
they don't type your blood before you give it? Seems like a lot of
nonsense to me and an unjust method of calling for a show of patriotism."
