Rumor No.1, heard August 3rd and 5th, from two different sources,
"that there would be no second front opened in Europe by the United Nations 
this year, because first, the United States and England have an understanding 
that no help will be given to Russia this year in the nature 
of a second front; and second, that England is quite content with the progress 
of the war in Russia, because she is satisfied to see Russia weakened 
by a long siege."
