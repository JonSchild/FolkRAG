[*A*]

Two rookies were making the rounds
of the camp when they met a general.
The general saluted, but instead 
of returning the salute, the first rookie
socked the general in the jaw, knocking
him down. The general no sooner got 
up when the second rookie knocked 
him down. After sputtering around for
a while the general asked the first
soldier why he hit him. The soldier
replied, "Sir, I was just thinking and 
I got so mad I hit you." The general 
then asked the second soldier, "Why 
did you hit me?" The soldier answered,
"When I saw the way my buddy hit
you I thought the war must be
over, so I celebrated."

Rumor: Hitler is dead.
