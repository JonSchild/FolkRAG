Walter Brown Tape 1 Side 1      2216   36

WB: My name is Walter Brown and I'm here this morning for the telling of
the story of my life. My name is Walter Brown and I was born 19 and 11,
the 23rd day of December. I lived in a one store town that they called
Priscilla. I was born on a man's place by the name of Walter Brannon
Back in a pocorn orchard, next to a creek. My parents were Lily Brown and my [fath]
father was Tom Brown. We lived there till I was three years old. I used
to go out in the field when I was three years and tell my mother -- I didn't 
call her Mother then, I called her Lily -- I said, "Lily, if you give me some
titty I'll help you pick some cotton." And she sat down on a sack and she let
me suck the titty. And I'd tell her, "You better go and pick cause I ain't
gonna pick no cotton because I'm going back to the house."

It was kind of rough then, back in those days. The food would run out
and one morning I was hungry and I was sitting down with just a napkin on.
They had fireplaces then, they didn't have heaters like they do now, they 
had fireplaces, and I was sitting down on the fireplace with just a napkin on,
no shoes, no nothing. And I looked out through the door and I saw my daddy
come back with a ----- sack over his back and I knew he had some food.
And I told my mother _________ Mama, Mama, Mama. I------'ll put the pot
over the fireplace for you." She Laughed and when she laughed I turned over
and my toes hit the hot coals. See they is white on top now.

So we lived there until I was 4. We moved out to Winneford from Priscilla.
On Mr E.H. Winn's place now. It was his place then but he had another place in
