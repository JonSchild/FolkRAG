Sweet Peter (Werewolf)
Buch Asa.

That's a wolf -- that really is -- a wolf or something.  That's as 
far as I can go.
A:  [Is Fustin’ Tom] A person turned into a wolf?
B:  Uh-uh.  Supposed to be something like a dog.  You see, they go around 
the country and kill dogs, kill dogs, that's just like if there's a bunch of dogs here and a 
bunch of dogs a few hours up there.  Well, he come here and before 
I could get outdoors, he [done] been kill mine and [set] up there jumping on yours.  They 
call him [Sweet] Swift Peter.  Nobody could never catch him.
A:  Did you know of any case of [Sweet] Swift Peters actually appearing in the 
country?
B:  Not [yet] real.  I heard about it.
[*Louis*] [A]:  Did you ever hear about the axe-[men]man or such things as that?
B:  Axe-[men]man?
[*Louis*] [A]:  I think there are a lot of stoires about the axe-men.  What's that, 
Louie?  I never heard about that?

The Preacher Fooled.

He'd always put up with ‘em. He had a right young wife.  [Naturally he had] Nice young thing and 
[praise] he was crazy about her, the preacher [would] was, you know.  And every time this 
boy would go out, you know, every time the preacher was there, you 
know, the boy would go out to cut wood or catch a chicken or something, 
well, this [preacher would beat this girl’s door and he’d beg] this girl pass the preacher's door he'd be begging for her to 
come in.  "Come in, honey, come in."  "[Get a down] Aw, go on, Reverend," Say, [Get] You
 [a down] better go on." Say, "I'm gonna [set] tell my husband on you."  "Oh, no, don't 
do that; don't do that.  [You should] Be ahsamed of yourself."  
So the preacher kept aworryin her, aworryin, aworryin, aworryin, you
