My cousin who is fighting in North Africa
relates the following story about the war in Africa.
He was out on patrol duty with his squad, when
they saw a "bunch" of Italians coming toward them.
So they took cover and waited for them to come
nearer. He could see that they were out numbered
2 to 1 , but as the Italians came closer one of the
Americans notice that the Italians were unarmed. 
So they captured them and took them
back to camp. When the Lieutent questioned
the soldiers he found out most of the prisoners
were Italian officers, they had come to give
themselves up. When they were asked why, they
said maybe they would get something to eat,
and they were tired of running back in the same
direction from which they had come.
