Item #6 Dialogue [translation]
...Hush there...
Give them directions...
Gentlemen, thanks, because my house was not food.
Yes.
My house was not food; I am removing the house 
[from] there because it is too close to [the] ravine. I"m 
pulling it a little more...deep...for storm not to have destroyed it..
Your water was good but there wasn"t enough 
rum.
And willing men gave you a good hand to put 
it in place.
Yes..I met a good many men to have given 
me a hand for me to have removed it [from] there;
but, damage! [ i.e unfortunately], I didn't have sufficient 
rum for me to have removed it [to] where I was 
putting it there.
The food was limited also...
I didn't have food now.
The meat (?) was not enough at all, at all, at all...
Hush boy...
Take it the sense mon...
Look Mr. Dickson is going to bring [a] rum for me
now, for me to see if i will transport it again.
But even though Mr. Nicho, even though you see 
you didn't have a drop of rum, I would help you until
because, for what reason, alas, you are [involved] in all 
service which there is in the place. I would always help.
Yes sir.
Give him your name, give him your name.
Yes.
Well Mr. Nich..
Mr...shut up!
Give him your name who said you will help him 
there!
