Tape: 238     18
makin' a noise, and some of our songs are just a noise, and the way some
people sing is just a noise. When you sing a song so fast, you can't
understand the notes and you can't understand the words that you're
sayin'-- it's just a noise. But if you sing it the way the author
intended it for it to be sung, why then there is a spiritual feeling--
it gives you a spiritual uplift. And bein' a minister for the past
thirty years, Sacred Harp singing has given me [meaning] many thoughts
...
just taken from a Sacred Harp song. And my radio program on Sunday
mornin' now on WANA in Anniston, Alabama, I'll occasionally play a 
Sacred Harp song. And on occasion when I can't find the song that I 
want to fit the scripture or the message that I feel the Lord wants
me to deliver, I sing one myself, just singin' the tenor part.
   How about singin' somethin' for us now that you particularly like, 
that would mean somethin' to you..
   Well, a song that I sing a lot is [*Idumea*]... I believe it's 47 on
the bottom in the Sacred Harp book. I believe that's the page number
in the Sacred Harp book. [*TAPE ENDS HERE*]

     Let's do that one.
     All right, sir. ...           is 358 in the Sacred
Harp, and the notes go somethin' like this--
     Let's just do the words.
     Just do the words.
     Yes.
