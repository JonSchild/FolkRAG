Dear Mr. Lomax,
Lady Gore-Browne tells me you
might be interested to hear some recordings
of folk music which I made in Yugoslavia
(Macedonia and Kosmet) in the summer
of 1955. The BBC have taken some
of them for the archives library, so I have
them both on tape and on disc. I, for my
part, should very much like to talk to
you about (and perhaps hear again) some
of the recordings you make in Italy,
particularly those of the Albanian villages
in Apulia. I shall be coming to London
