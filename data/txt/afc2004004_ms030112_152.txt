LIONEL:
That was a good one, Marriage is like a mangled truck. (LAUGTHER)
LARRY:
Well you understand when my marriage first started going under we were separated for a year or so and I try to go back and all that. And I was telling Brother Davis everything about it and he was giving me advice and I was following his advice. Even today, I'm still following Brother Davis's advice because one thing he told me that day before I left here he said Larry try to get your family back together and give some of you time to God. That I will try. But I was saying he told me about marriage this way. "Its like a rope" You could stretch it and stretch it and stretch it he says Larry see the woman over there we together 35 years so and you stretch this rope and you stretch it and then it'll break. You can tie back together and it'll be strong as ever,
but theres a knot in there.
MRS. DAVIS:
And another thing I heard him tell you giving you advice, he say Larry, when things get too bad in the house he says leave, he says don't fuss in the house just leave. And then you cool off and come back. I heard him tell you that a number of times.
LARRY:
(LAUGHTER)
