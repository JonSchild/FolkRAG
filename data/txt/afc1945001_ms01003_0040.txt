Dear Roy:

Meade tells me today on the authority of a
paper manufacturer that the Government has discovered
that it has too much paper order and has cancelled
all outstanding orders. The further rumor that he 
passes on is that there are 190 carloads of paper
ordered by the Government on railroad tracks paying
demurrage. I thought maybe this was something you
would like to look into.

Very truly yours,

Bob
