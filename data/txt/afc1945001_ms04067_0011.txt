"There is so much red tape connected with the Government that the
new lumber used at Remington for temporary sheds and buildings is just piled
up and burned when they're through with it, instead of allowing it to be
used some other place or sold to the public. If the Government can afford
to burn up lumber like that, how can they expect the public to stint and
give up things for themselves? That kind of stuff gets around, you know."
