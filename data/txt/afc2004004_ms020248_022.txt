TL:      What all did you do in that amount of time?
BJ:      Um.   Jus' do like I tell all I done, hum, hum, hum!
TL:      What kind of work did you do?
BJ:      Oh, I just worked.   I worked in people's houses, tha's all.  
An' worked some in farms, you know, an' like -- I call 'em farm 
because they was vegetable farms.   Worked that way.   An' worked, 
mostly I worked -- I was in Miami an' I worked in, in the house, 
cookin'.   I have cooked a lil' bit too much in this life.  I

think I'm knockin' off.   I done knocked off enough in [this] the last six 
years [(?)].
TL:      Why?  You sick of it?
BJ:      Um-hum.  I knocked off about 5, 6 years.  You know, steady-goin'
cookin', all the time.   I cooked, any-anywhere I go I cook 
some, ya know?   But jus' say takin' a reg'lar job fer it, I. . .
TL:      Do you like to cook?

[an' be] cleanin' up 'cause I know they can [go on] get up an' git their 
meals an' go on about their business.    But I could go home an' 
clean up.   So that's why I knock off a whole lot of cookin' an' 
stuff.  I just had to stop. Just' too much of it.
