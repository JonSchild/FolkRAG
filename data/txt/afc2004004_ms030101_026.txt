Midnight Special

Verses from Camp Number One Parchman, Mississippi.

My mother wrote a letter,
My sister wrote a card,
Ef you want to come to see us,
You'll have to ride the rods.

Look looky, looky yonder,
What in the worl' do I see?
I see the brown skin woman
Comin' after me.

She wore a mother Hubbard
Jes' like a mournin' gown, 
Trimmin' on her apron
Oh, how it do hang down!

Lord, Thelma said she love me,
I b'lieve she tole a lie
'Cause she hasn' been to see me
Since the las' July.

She brought me a little coffee
She brought me a little tea.
She brought me nearly ev'ything
But the jailhouse key.

I gwine away to leave you,
An' my time ain' long,
The man is gonna call me,
An' I'm goin' home.

Then I'll be done all my grievin'
Hoopin', holl'in an' a-cryin'
Then I'll be done all my stud' in,
'Bout my grea' long time.
