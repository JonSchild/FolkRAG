Cowboy Reunion

Doc Ellis and his chuck wagon from the Spur Ranch. Horses
pitch "high, wide and handsome." Talk to 'em," Hit 'em and scratch
'em on the hairy side."

"They have crossed the Great Divide
where the hoofprints point to the settin' sun,
With no returnin' tracks;
When rumblin ' herds are driftin' on,
But none are comin' back'".

Heroes of '90 who rode a dun pony, 80 miles from sun to sun
give way to the man who can cover the some trail 80 miles in 80
minutes.

"The purpose of the Texas Pioneer Cowboy Reunion Assn. is to
keep alive the memories and the traditions of an age that is fast
drifting into the trash heaps of things that were." We will scrape
stirrups and ride boot to boot again with the old timers.

In the early part of 1930 a group of Stanford men, headed by
Swenson Ranch managers met to form an association to keep alive the
memories and traditions of the Old West, the days of the long horn
cattle and the open range to answer the cook's call from the chuck
wagon. "Come and git it on I'll throw it to the dogs."

"Under the star-studded canopy cast,
Campfire and coffee and comfort at last;
Bacon that sizzles and crisp in the pan
After the round-up smells good to a man."

Men who punched cattle befo e 1895 given special badges. Old
fiddlers contest in the morning, square dancing at night. No one
person connected with organization is paid a dime for his services.

"To perpetuate the traditions of the mne who rescued this
country from the Indian and the buffalo. Until the last drive has
been made, the last alkali bogs have been passed and the last great
round-ups shall find us all together where cutting horses never get
tired adn where no night guards are needed."
