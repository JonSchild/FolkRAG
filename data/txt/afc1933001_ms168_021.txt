JOSEPH LOSEY 217 EAST 48th STREET Plaza 8-3065

March 20, 1941

Dear Alan,

Sorry to have missed you
consistently, although I guess there
was nothing very urgent that we had
to meet about.

I enclose copies of letters
sent to Mrs. Coolidge and Mr. Seegar.

We seem to be making a little
progress.

Regards, JL
