Folk Festival

This year Washington, D. C., will
be host to the National Folk Festival,
the 17th annual event of its kind.
Under the sponsorship of the Washington
Post Folk Festival association,
the festival programs will be presented
in Constitution hall on April
25, 26, and 27.

The festival was founded by its
present national director, Sarah Gertrude
Knott, with the avowed purpose
"to bring together the folk
groups from various sections of the
United States in regional folk festivals 
and programs, in order to keep
alive traditional customs associated
with the founding of this nation."

Some 30 states will be represented
on the programs.  The participating
groups vary in size from two to 75 
persons, their trips to Washington
being financed by educational institutions
and civic organizations from
coast to coast.  There will be cowboys
from the southwestern plains,
miners from Pennsylvania's anthracite
region, lumberjacks from the
great north woods and Negroes from
the south.  Besides offering native
material, these and many other types
of performers also will present the
folk arts which have been transplanted
from the old world, particularly
those from the British Isles,
Spain, France, and Germany.
