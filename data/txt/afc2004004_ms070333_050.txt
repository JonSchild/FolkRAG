GOOD FISHING
On Beaver Island there are six inland lakes with wooded shore line.
These lakes are scattered about the Island within easy driving distance
from St. James.  Their clear waters invite the fishing enthusiast to days
of real sport and enjoyment.  They are regularly stocked with game fish.
The fisherman has a choice of casting, trolling and still fishing—it is an
angler's paradise.
 A day at one of these lakes with a guide and a good boat offers
more relaxation and pleasure than can be found at any ordinary lake
resort.
INLAND LAKES—BATHING
The Inland Lakes on Beaver Island are fed by springs with deep
clear water; the sandy beaches are beautifully set in natural woods.
Here one comes closely in contact with the realities of Nature, all within 
a short distance of the King Strang hotel and the cottages.
HIKING
On Beaver Island one of the most popular forms of diversion is that
of hiking through the woods.  After a five or ten mile jaunt over the
wooded  trails you'll feel like a different person.  Visit some of the high
points from which the waters of Lake Michigan are seen in every direction.  
Then you will enjoy a dinner and a night's rest in a way you
have never though possible before.
Guides are available for hiking parties.
