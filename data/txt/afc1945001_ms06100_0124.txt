August 3 -- Memphis
The Higgins Ship Building contract was canceled because Higgins canceled 
a contract with a friend of Jesse Jones because he was twenty-nine
days late with his work. The friend advised Higgins that if his contract
was canceled the Higgins contract would be canceled -- and it was a few
days later. (Substantial businessman)  [*17*]
