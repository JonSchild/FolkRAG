The Church

The church plays an important institutional role in the community, and serves, in a measure, to regulate social relations.  It is a medium of emotional expression, and, where more secular and undisciplined amusements do not compete too strongly provides occasional recreation.  The church, with its regular weekly or monthly services, prayer meetings, picnics, suppers, provide the one institution in which the Negroes move freely.

There are being introduced, through the schools, other forms of recreation which are gradually being accepted by the people of the community.  Organizations such as the parent-teacher's association, canning clubs and other clubs have contributed to a change in the mores of the group.
