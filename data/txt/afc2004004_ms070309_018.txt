Remember song of old Negro woman
tell 'em about how to spell "huckleberry"

From Mason - the druggist -
When I was a kid I watched a kid
makin' a sorghum mill - packin' mud
—  Mo' mud, Milse!
   Wah!
—Mo' mud, Wah!

From James Sharkey ? (53 yrs old) on King & Anderson Plan
Blacksmith - sings at anvil
O Lawd, remember me,
Remember all my dying groans
O lawd, remember me.
I'm a church man, I don't sing
the blues - fellow works with me
sings 'em. - Mostly I sing
Dr. Watt's hymns.
Be working on gang plows and 
wagons, be moanin' -
They sings the song and then they
moans it! Learned to moan
back from my old foreparents -
moaning in the field, mother
