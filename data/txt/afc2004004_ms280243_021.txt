Willy's Fate:
1)  For Willy's gang ower yon high high hill,
And doon yon dowie den;
For it was there he met a griev-i-ous ghost
That would fear ten thousand men.

2)  For he's gane doon by Mary kirk,
And in by Mary style,
Wan and weary was the ghost
On him that grimly smiled.

3)  Oft hae ye travelled this road, Willy,
Oft hae ye travelled in sin,
Nor thought what would come of your poor soul
When your sinful life was done.

4)  Oft hae ye travelled this road, Willy,
Your bonnie new love to see,
Oft hae ye travelled this road, Willy, 
Nor thought       of me.

5)  Oft hae ye travelled this road, Willy,
Your bonnie new love to see,
But you'll never travel this road again
For this nicht avenged I'll be.

6)  Then she has ta'en her perjured love
And reived him gair by gair,
And ilka side o' Mary's style
Of him she hanged a share.

7)  His father and mother both made mourn,
His true love mucke mair,
His father and mother baith made mourn,
And his new love reived her hair.

Jamie Raeburn:
1)  My name is Jamie Raeburn, frae Glasga toon I came,
My place and habitation I was forced to leave for shame,
My place and habitation noo I maun gang awa',
Far, far frae all the hills and dales o' Caledonia.

2)  It was early in the morning before the dawn of day,
The keeper he came up to us, and unto us did say,
"Arise, you trembling convicts, arise you in an hour,
This is the day we sail away frae Caledonia."
