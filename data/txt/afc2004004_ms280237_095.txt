Cox: I can't say much about them. I think they're all alike. It's like
the 11th commandment. "Steer yout own star" (?) That's the 11th
commandement.
The Miller's will:
1) There was an old miller in Bedfordshire,
He had three sons as you shall hear,
As he was going to make his will
To see which son should have the mill. (Repeat last two lines.)
2) The first he called was his eldest son,
He said, "My race is almost run,
If to you the mill I will give,
Now tell me what toll you mean to have."
3) He said, "Father, my name is Jack,
Of every combe I'll take a peck.
Out of every combe that I do grind,
Look what a god living I shall find."
4) You are your father's eldest babe,
You have not learnt your poor father's trade.
So to, you the mill I don't give
You take such toll no man can live.
5) The next he called was his second son, etc. . .
6) He said, "Father, my name is Ralph,
Out of every combe I will take half,
Out of every combe that I do grind,
Look what a good living I shall find."
7) You are your father's second  babe, etc. . .
8) The next he called was his youngest son, etc. . .
9) He said, "Father, my name is Mack,
I'll take the all and take the sack,
Out of every combe that I do grind,
Look what a god living I shall find.
10) You are your father's youngest babe,
You've thoroughly learned your poor father's trade,
Andso to you the mill I do give,
You take such toll and a man can live.

Eighteen stone is a combe of wheat; sixteen a combe of barley;
nineteen a combe of beans; twelve a combe of oats. . .
