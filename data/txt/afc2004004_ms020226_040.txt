All right.  We went on an' we ah, we was talkin' about we was goin'.  Clara said, "You gonna be sick."

I said, "I'm goin'."  Ya know.  So I say...

An' Arizona say, "You gonna eat some soup befo' you go."

An ah, Gertrude's, next room, ya know, like that.  She heard it.  Well, we been goin' diffrut times, so many times, on not call 'er.  Well, we all good friends.  We ride with one another.  I had no idea she had this in her mind, ya know.  An' so, Gertrude, she was in there; she heard it.

Finally, after a while, Clara was sittin' on trunk an' I was in the bed.  I was on.  An' ah, Clara was turnin' this cane they call jinte (joint) cane.  It was 'bout big as my wrist near 'bout, great big cane.

An' ah, Clara said, "I ain't got but about three jintes."  Said, "You want part of it?"

Clara say, "Well... You want all of it?"  She tried to talk wit' 'er nice.  Nobody had nothin' to git mad about."

"Yeah!"  She cussed, you know.  "You hear what I said.  I want all of it!"  She musta peeked through the crack an' seed Clara.  This way she wanna start a fuss.
