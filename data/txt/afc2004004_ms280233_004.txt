Christ Did Me Ransome:
1) Christ did me ransome, died for you,
All with his holy hand
He made the sun clear off the moon,
Like the water on dry land. (2)

He died upon the Cross.
We'll do as much for our dear Lord
As he has done for us.

O hell is deep and hell is dark,
O hell is full of fires,
What can we do for our dear Lord
As he has done for us?

The Royal Duke of Grantham.
1) Six noble dukes they went a-fishing
Down by the sea-side,
One of them spied a dead body
Come floating on the tide.
2) They said to each other,
These words I heard them say,
"It is the royal duke of Grantham
That the tide has washed this way."
3) They took him up to Portsmouth,
To the place where he was known,
From there up to London,
To the place where he was born.
4) They took out his bowels,
They stretched out his feet,
They embalmed his body
With spices so sweet.
5) Six dukes went before him
To bear him from the ground,
Six dukes followed after
All in their black mourning gowns.
6) Black is the mourning
White is the wands,
And yellow are the flamboys
That they carry in their arms.
7) He lies between two towers,
He lies in the cold clay.
And the royal queen of Grantham
Went a-weeping away.
