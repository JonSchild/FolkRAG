Passion Ballad (Ponza) 

Son, what pain of your sainted forhead, 
Which is [to me] like the rising sun, 
O, Son, Alas! 

Son, what pain of your sainted [eye]brows, 
Which are [to me] like the shining sun, 
O, Son, Alas! 

Son, [its] what pain of your sainted eyes, 
[Mother] Mamma has seen you die on the cross, 
O, Son, Alas! 

Son, what pain of your sainted face, 
And how it stood so many blows, 
O, Son, Alas! 

Son, what pain of your sainted nose, 
They've [made it] beaten it into a piece of fine wax, 
O, Son, Alas!
