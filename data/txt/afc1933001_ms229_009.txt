Dear Alan:

In proposing my Adventures
I  ran on an old record, partly
written out by you, showing that
we paid to Lead Belly from his
earnings during three months, from 
Dec. 20, 1934, to March 25, 1935, the total
of $654.42. Later I sent him to
Dallas his part of a deferred payment
from March of Time, as I 
recall, $16.50. This makes the grand total
$670.92. You should bear in 
mind also that we gave Lead Belly
and Martha also free board and
room, and that I took Lead Belly
when he was a ragged outcast,
