in information. The project can profit greatly through the coopera-
tion of local newspapers, radio, civic groups, librarians, welfare
agencies, and other established information centers. Materials to
supply the information needed to cover local rumors can usually be
found locally.
If the rumor-control project wishes to convert itself with
non-local rumors, it can summarize such rumors and report them to
the Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of War Information, which
will try to supply necessary information materials. Sometimes this
material will already have been prepared but not widely enough dis-
tributed; or an analysis of rumors from rumor-control groups may
show the need for giving the facts wider distribution.
Non-local rumors, for most efficient handling by the 
Office of War Information, can be divided as follows:
1. Production: raw materials, agriculture, finished
products, general progress
2. Transportation
3. Manpower: labor, management
4. Economic problems
5. Price control
6. Wage stabilization 
7. Rationing, conservation, and salvage
8. War bonds, taxation, inflation
9. Military matters
10. Selective Service
11. Consumer problems
12. Health and welfare
