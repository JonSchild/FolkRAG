Miss Gertie Colvin
R 2, Box 25
Versailes, Mo.

Dear Miss Colvin:

Your letter of recent date has been referred to the Division of
Music for attention and report.

Thank you very much for your offer to make recordings for us. As
it happens, we have no machines available at the present time, and cannot
take advantage of it.

Mr. Alan Lomax, the Assistant-in-charge of our Archive of American
Folk Song is now out on an extensive recording expedition. On his
return, we will bring your offer to his attention, and if it turns out
that the necessary arrangements can be made, he will get in touch with
you.

For the Librarian of Congress.

Sincerely yours,

Edward N. Waters
Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
