] among the friend.  Muscatel is some wine that make you dance backwards and forwards 
and. . . .
:  Let's talk the politics over here.  Do you think they'd be interested
in that?  Do you have any good stories about politics and [INAUDIBLE].
Do you have anything?
:  All right, I'll tell you something about politics.  In 1939 our 
father, the [police jury] you call that, there was 7, 7 running in the race.  You 
asked me [UNCLEAR] politics.  In 1939 he was still in [INAUDIBLE] country or 
Las Vegas or something.  Anyway, they make fun of our father, you know.  He can 
no more win than nothing, our father, you know.  He run for [police jury].  There 
was seven in the race.  The old man, he beat them all, he had no vote, they all 
seven, all eight, or six together.  Come the second race he had no race.  He come 
second term, four year, second term again, four years, nobody.  Then he just, 
he said I won't resign but he say you all vote for the other guy, [UNCLEAR] for 
[is.] me. Uh-huh, you see, that's the way politics

:  Talking about politics, you know.  When you're a friend you're 
a friend.  And we never spend no money.  He's not stingy.  He's dead now but, 
[several] years.  But not that, very kind hearted.  He looked like Abraham Lincoln, 
old Abe Lincoln.
     Well, what else you wanted to cover?
LOMAX  Just say what, what you have to say about the, the culture of Mamu
and Cajun culture.  I mean do you think your culture just as good as anybody
else's?
:  [FRENCH]  . . .about five parish.  You go, I could go fly if I fly straight,
you go right there, because that's a, a [UNCLEAR].  Chico, they call that
redneck.  Then you go right down [UNCLEAR] maybe 20, 22 mile, 25 miles.  You
call that the [red] [UNCLEAR].  They [dark] people and they are redneck.  They all
kind of. . . 
:  Well you don't call them black, you don't call them. . .
:  And here, no, no.  And here the [Cunnard,] the Cajun.  Then you
get about quarter, fifty miles only, not that far, and they, they talk different,
different.  One word means another thing, it means a wrong [UNCLEAR] in English, 
is  Format [mean something] else, [bonco].
LOMAX  You mean by the different dialects.
:  [UNCLEAR]
LOMAX  In French, yeah.
:  And then you go a little further on that side, over there, you call
that [UNCLEAR].  That's another dialect that's not the same.  One word, like
a frog or a small frog, that can mean another thing, you know.  [UNCLEAR]
:  [UNCLEAR . . .what he's talking about.
:  And it's, it's all, just about, let's say a radius of about, I'd 
say maybe it's a 100 miles around from Mamu, there's about five different kinds

:  You see that, that's the creole, that doesn't [UNCLEAR].
:  Now that's a real Frenchman there.
:  [CROSS TALKING]
LOMAX  I mean this place is a big important center for. . . .
:  Alan, you know what I think about our culture?  I think we're so 
far ahead of, talking about other cultures, and I'm not saying this to brag, I'm 
not saying [UNCLEAR] part of it, but, and I've talked to, you know, people from 
[?] North Louisiana, they  come here on Saturday morning.  They see what we got.
They be here shaking their heads and they go back probably [UNCLEAR].  But they can't, their religion holds them down.  The Baptist won't go for this stuff, a
lot of musical [gyration].  I mean all of the, we're superior I would say to most
other co, ethnic groups.
[CROSS TALKING]
Go ahead, [Craig].
