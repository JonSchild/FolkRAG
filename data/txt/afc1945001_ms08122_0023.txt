A Dissapointment
Nearly one month ago today
my brother was to come home on a
week end pass. He called up
my sister-in-law,-his wife, and
informed her that he would be home 
the following week. This happened
on a Friday night. Saturday
around twelve, he called my mother
and said he'd be home the next
morning. We were all so happy
until about 2:30 when he called
again. We knew something must
of happened. Sure enough his
pass had been canceled. He
was being shipped out of this
camp to another. He had only
been at this one for four days.
Everyone was so downhearted
after that. Now he is in Mass.
