Dear Mr. Lomax:
Devil Cold knocked me out for a few days, hence this
belated acknowledgment to your good letter.
Of the two ideas you suggest, the Ledford interests me
most personally, but I can't quite see it as something for
Common Ground. Wouldn't it essentially be more of an article
on the issue itself than the people involved? That would
take it out of our province. But I'd be glad to consider
this idea further if you'd care to give me a bit more dope
on it.
Probably the best bet is the Asheville Festival, not
written with the idea that is is an exotic thing, but something
natively American; a larger expression of the American
community, a living picture of the kind of the people that go
to make up the country. I think you suggest this approach in
your letter. I believe it is the vital one, and would be very
much interested in seeing a piece written around that.
Can you make the April 10th deadline with the article?
Cordially,
Frank Mlarkar

P.S. And thanks a lot for suggesting the name of Charles Todd;
we'll get in touch with him.
