South Carolina -- A large stack of truck and jeep tires, slightly worn and used, was burned while farmers begged for them.

Illnois -- An army camp received new tires for their equipment;  so they discarded all the old ones, some 30,000 and burned them.

Washington -- A non-commissioned officer here was recently ordered by his superiors to pour gasoline over rejected rubber boots and burn them.

The majority of these stories are found in the Far West.  None were reported from New England.

Anti-Red Cross

Massachusetts -- The Red Cross sells the blood donated.

Illinois -- The Red Cross never sends the shawls made by volunteers to refugees.  Instead it sells them at auction in New York where it is the vogue for society ladies to wear them.

New Jersey -- Soldiers have to pay $12.50 for the sweaters knitted by Red Cross volunteers.

These appear most frequently in New England and the Middlewest.

Anti-Labor

California -- Workers in shipyards are deliberately slowing down and sometimes do a job three or four times over.

Wisconsin -- Men in air craft factories are given two days to do a job that a good workman could do in half a day.

Michigan -- Defense workers are taking two to three days off a week to go fishing, then tell their bosses to go to hell when they complain.

These rumors are current throughout the country but particularly in the Far West.

Anti-Business

New York -- General Electric, General Motors and Westinghouse are making 400% profit on war contracts.

California -- A few large corporations have a monopoly on rubber and are preventing the use of it by the Army and Navy.

Massachusetts -- Big business hopes to keep the war going as long as possible because huge profits are being made.

These are heard throughout the entire country but particularily in the Far West.
