TAPE 93 - HARRY COX
1) On the 14th of November from Yarmouth we set sail,
The wind being East-Nor'-East, my boys, with a sweet and pleasant gale.
Until it did blow harder, the sea rolled mountains high,
And at night when we did shoot, my boys, how dismal looked the sky.

2) The morning when he hauled, our anchor we let go,
There was very few of fish, my boys, what sorrows you do know,
There's very few can tell what poor fishermen undergo,
All those that are on the salt sea when the stormy wyndes do blow.

3) We bent our other anchor, and by it we did ride,
Full four hours or more, boys,
Until my watch on deck, when they did so loudly call, strongly tied,
There's a ship come down upon us, o master they did call.

4) To think she did go clear of us we all were very glad,
You must think and recollect, my boys, our case is very hard.
To think she did go clear of us, how glad were all our lot,
For she cam so very close to us, our cable for to cut.

5) At least it was not all, for our hopes on fire did get,
We did not lose for the wants of them, we did not lose for wit,
But into harbour leageuer and on the sloop did go,
And the next day put to sea again, hurraw hurraw, my boys.

6) So now our voyage is ended and all things are done,
Here's health unto our owner, here's health unto his son.
Here's health unto the people that stood the voyage through,
And here's health unto our master, our boy and all our crew.

Lomax: O that's smashing, Harry, that's smashing.  How old is that
song Harry ?

Cox: Well, I don't know.  Hundreds of years ago.  My father - well,
he's been dead thirty years, and he was 92.  That was before his
time.  Done in his time.  That's the time he learnt it.  That's a
Yarmouth song, that is.

Lomax: Is that true ?

Cpx: Yes, that's -- the old fishermen made that - what they
went through when they were fishing and they didn't get it.
Herring catchers.  That time of day there were sails - not steam.  They
were old sailing boat times.

Lomas: They had a mighty hard life, didn't they ?

Cox: Yeah.  That was about how that happened.  As nigh as they
could make it up - what that was like.

Lomax: Uh-huh.  What did a man make in those days on the fishing boats?
