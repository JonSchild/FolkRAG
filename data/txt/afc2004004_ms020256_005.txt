      An' ah, an' ah, an' so?  They [they] we ah, coax her an' coax
her -- at least they did -- until she got in the house.  Out --
until she got on the porch.  An' she wouldn't come in the do'.
So I got some of the stuff then; sumpin' tol' me to git some of
[the stuff] it an' go around there.  I went around the house an' I went
chunkin' an' throwing it.  An' she went in that house. She jumped
in that bed an' covered up!  Hollered, "Bessie ain't got nothin'
on me."  An' we ain' gonna git no more wood that day!  Brother, 
she was tremblin'!  Sumpthin' had sumpthin' in her.  An' it was
terrible!  I begin to think she gonna die,  you know?  Would go
in-into hysterics. Good gracious!
        An', ah, so? We got her quieted down. Miz Melton said, "Done
that much good, Bessie." [But] Said "She didn' leave the house." 'Cause
see, she can't go back out.  See?  So just continue put it on in
there.  An' boy!  Leola went back an' got some mo'.  It's heavy; it's
good; it was a heap of it.  More'n I ever seen in one place, ya
know. 
       An' she got more an' we jus' boiled it an' we jus' drenched
that whole 'round the house.  All around the house. Listen to me
good, now.  Put it all around the house; all over her bed; all in
there.  An' she lay down an' went to sleep a while.  Didn't talk
to another spirit [or anything] that evening.  Not that whole evenin'.
        An' that night Miz Melton put the belt on 'er.  Me an' Leola
an' ah, an' Clara, jus' -- my cousin Clara that came to flahdah with me --
we an' ah, an' ah, Rosetta.  We slep' in one room.   An' I an; ah,
Clara slep' together.  Rosetta an' Leola.  All right. The fireplace
there            , double, fat chimney, ya know. That night, 'way
in that night, we heard sumpin' in that chimney. Looked like
chains was falling' down, coming' all aroun' that chimney, ya see?
