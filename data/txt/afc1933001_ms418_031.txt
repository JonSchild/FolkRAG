Answer To a Fence Rider's Prayer

Oh, yes, Brother Weakheart, we got your letter long ago;
Now we'll answer all your questions--tell you what you
wished to know
You're holding up your dollar? To keep yourself in good
repute?
Just to see who stands to win the jurisdictional dispute?

You say John's quit college; he's working now, pitching hay--
Getting all his grub and lodging, and half a buck a day,
And Jane's not studying music - just a-working down the line,
Got a swell job in the cannery (when it's working, half
the time).

That's the spirit, Brother Weakheart, all the bosses like to see;
When the fight is over, you'll come back to them on bended
knee.
Johnny has the best idea - to join up with the CCC's;
He can dig ten thousand postholes out among the virgin trees,

Jane's spare time will come in handy (we will make an even bet);
She will get an education that the family won't forget!
Should advice be further needed, send your letter (with a stamp)
And we'll mail you our opinion after you've become a tramp.
- The Bull Cook
