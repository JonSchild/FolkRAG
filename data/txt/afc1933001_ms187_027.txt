Mr. Alan Lomax,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax.

We really were quite disappointed
when you failed to come back to see
us. But then we realize that a
"blow out" is indeed a calamity now.

However, we are hoping the trip 
can be repeated in a happier time
when tires are once again plentiful.

Next Sunday is Communion day
at Bildad. We wish you could be
there and hear the congregation sing.
We plan to go.

The group that sang for you was
delighted to do so and we are happy
that we could be of any assistance to
you.  Let us know if we can
again help with the work we so
much enjoy.

Hoping we may again have the
pleasure of having you in our home
and with kindest regards to you from
my family and me.

Sincerely  Mrs. L. L. McDowell
