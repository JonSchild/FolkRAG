[*Caterpillars*]

The datacombs out yonder and all the silkworms
Afforded him the best of linen.
Says that this man wore fine linen
Not only fine linen, but he had purple with it.
An' you know anybody that could wear
Fine linen and purple then was somebody.
Not only did this man wear fine linen and an' purple.
But he fared sumptuously.
Oh, you know, like some of us, you know.
You know here lately, you know
 [*Listen everybody (Sung)*]
The women don't have to bake biscuits [no] any more.
Got the toaster to sit it right on the table.
Call the bakery an' he'll send the bread down
An' she slips it in there an' slip it out.
Sumptuously.
I think about these young people here tonite.
Most of 'em sleepin' on fairy felt mattress
An' can' get up an' come to church for prayer meetin on Sun. morning
Faring sumptuously.
Their fathers back there slep' on hay an' slats all nite.
Got up early the next mornin' an' got to church on time.
We farin' sumptuously.
Back yonder we had to walk 15 an' 20 miles to get to the school.
An' didn't have but about 2 mos.
Now we got a school on every turn-row.
Farin' sumptuously.
Goin' out yonder to get somebody to advise mothers
[To] During the (very) early stages of prenatural birth.
Somebody to tell her what she should do an' what she shouldn't do.
What she should eat an' what she shouldn't eat.
Farin' Sumptuously.
An' you know we're farin'  so sumptuous, there ain' no more ugly folks now.
You know you can go down to the beauty shop an' get just as pretty as you
wanna for 2 and a half.
Farin' [sumptuously].
