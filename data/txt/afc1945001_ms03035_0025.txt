RUMORS

Rumor of the week in Detroit causing considerable alarm,
and which the Mayor of Detroit thinks has been deliberately planted to
intensify cleavage, is a persistent report that Negroes are to be moved
into the Brightmoor Housing project of 210 Federally financed units when
it is opened 60 to 90 days hence.
The Mayor reported August 13 that telephone calls on the
subject reaching him and the Detroit Housing Commission had risen to
15 a day, all from indignant citizens who wanted to know if it was true
"that Negroes are going to be moved into the Brightmoor project as soon
as it is ready for occupancy."
The questions differ in wording in only one respect, he says.
Some callers say they have heard that the whole project is to be turned
over to the blacks. Others say they have heard that 5 to 25 per cent of
the units will be made available for Negroes.
"It just isn't true, but with Detroit one of the hot racial
spots, the report is only aggravating a bad situation," said the Mayor. [*5*]
"Some people apparently think we're going to have a second Sojourner
Truth situation."
The report was first current, according to Detroit Housing
Commission officials, in March 1942.
Telephone inquiries to the Mayor and the Commission jumped
noticeably in early June. The volume ebbed, but in the past week rose
again.
