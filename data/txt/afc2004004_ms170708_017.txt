Kennedy: Now tell us about the song The Bold Fisherman, Harry.
Cox: (laughs) I told that to youse many times, about that one, didn't
I?
Kennedy: Well, you tell it better every time you tell it then, Harry.
Cox: I don't know. I have done it fairly well. I've done that - 
I done that one mornin' when we had our do there - down there at the
windmill. He wanted that sung on the record an' he was goin' to take
it away. I think I done that one there well that time, 'cordin' like
to my idea.
Kennedy: You left some out - you left it out when you were making
all those records. You told me.
Cox: They - they wor. They made me - I done them all on it.
Kennedy: Oh, I see.
Cox: We put the whole lot on. He wanted one for - to take away.
Kennedy: Well, sing it all now Harry. . .
Cox: An' that, er - I think I done that one well. I was just about 
rigged for it                                           An' I did do it.
Kennedy: You're rigged now. (laughter)
Cox: I - that's a long while ago since I have sung it.
Knnedy: Oh, but you do it well, Harry. Come on, now.
Cox: (mumbles and chuckles) I don' know if I can. I'll try it.

One morning in the month of June,
Down by a riverside,
There she beheld a bold fish-a-man
Come rowin' by the tide.
