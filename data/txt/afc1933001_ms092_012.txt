Mr. Leon Henderson, Administrator
Office of Price Administration
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Henderson:

As you are no doubt aware, the Library of Congress has been engaged during the
past few years in supplementing its collection of Americana in terms of field
recordings of otherwise unpublished, but at the same time, unique and valuable
specimens of American folk song and folk lore.

John A. Lomax, the Curator of the Archive, and by far its most productive field
worker, has, since 1933, traveled over 100,000 miles in the service of the Library
and the American people in his search for American folk songs. Mr. Lomax
is well along in years and uses his car almost exclusively for purposes of his
collecting work. At the present writing he is living in Dallas, Texas, and has
planned to make an extensive trip through the Southwest to record what remains
of the cowboy tradition along with the reminiscences of old-time cattle men and
the sentiment of their communities about the present victory effort. It is impossible
to make such a trip and to take the portable recording equipment to the
singers in their homes unless one travels by car. Unfortunately, it happens
that Mr. Lomax's tires have traveled well over 25,000 miles and are not fit for
the extensive recording expedition he plans to undertake soon.

I have written in his behalf to the local Tire Priorities Board but Mr. Lomax
informs me that they felt they could not make an exception to their rule in his
behalf. We, therefore, appeal to you to assist Mr. Lomax, if it seems justifiable,
in obtaining priority for a set of new tires for his car in order that his
valuable field work may be continued. I am sure that you agree as to its general
importance in defense and the preservation of our indigenous American culture.

As Acting Librarian of Congress, I would greatly appreciate your giving this
matter your favorable consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Luther H. Evans
Acting Librarian of Congress
