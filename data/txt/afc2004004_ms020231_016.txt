switch in a sack.  You know, gonna make me pick cotton.  See?
'Cause the other chilren pickin' more cotton than me an' some
of 'um's littler than me.  I jus' couldn't make it.  I'd go to
pick that cotton, I'd look back an' see that dev'lish switches, I
jus' couldn't -- that switch[es] in the sack -- I [jus'] couldn't
make it.  It stumped me.  It -- I don' know what it do to me.
It jus' -- I was watchin' the switch an' tryin' to pick the cotton.
Jus' cain't do it.
              So Papa had tol' her to take the switch out of [her] the bag.  See,
I had -- He musta watch me, I reckon, seen me [don] doin' it; [or] watched

me.  Ha!  That ain't, that ain't the way for me to be[have] made mind!
              A lot of chilrens is that way today.  You do better with them
by not beatin' them.  An' you, you know, teachin' 'em.  They'll take
it an' go.  An' some a 'em, ya have to jes' natchully knock it in,
