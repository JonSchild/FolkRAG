BJ TAPE 34, p. 21

[*MONEY-EARNING & SPENDING*]
many of 'em down home don't, don't think about they had a party.
Had -- An' not a regular cookin'.  See?  They jus' think that's
just it.  That's all.  They don't give nothin', nary a cent over,
nothin'.  An' they got such a habit, in places now, don't want
people even much to tip you, some of 'em don't.  Yeah, many
peoples don't.  Yeah, they. . .an' all like that.  Co'se, co'se
they tip ya anyhow.
         An' some of 'em'll give ya extra.  I worked -- I have worked
[with] at places that the white lady never did say nothin' about
no extra for, for, for workin'.  But every once in a while, her,
her, her husband, he, he hand me a dollar or two or three, four
dollars.  "Now, Bessie, that's sumpin' for you.  You're so nice."
TL:      Is that right?
BJ:      Um-hum.  But you never hear her say a word.  'Cause she just,
she just gittin' over.  An' I work with some, you know, when they
be payin' me off?  Well, ah, the good, ah, white women, they'd
give me, too, ya know.  But I don't say nothin' 'cause I know [I]
[God give me gotta give the] God'll give me the money back; I don't worry about it.   I
got a, I got a custom of that.  I, I d-- somehow or nother it's stamped
in me that God'll give me the money back, I don't care who take
it.  That's what -- I tell them that.  I say, "Well, I['m workin']
don't worry 'bout nothin' like that," I say, "Money, 'cause I
cain't even ta-- eat it, nohow."  I say, "If I want to use it for
the benefician of the world, I have to use it."
         An' sometime when I get paid I wanna have a lot of fun with
myself.  I don' know how they feel about it.  I say, "Well, I'm
goin' on back an' gi' it on back to ya.  Ya'll have it in a
few minutes, right back."
