Tucson, Arizona

Dear Mr. Dering:

Thank you for the tape of the Georgia Sea Island
Singers. I have listened to a bit of it and it
doesn't seem to me as if it were of sufficiently
well organized material to submit to the record
company that is interested in the Sea Island
group; however, I will give it another listen in
a few days and write you further.

Meantime, let me state one thing very clearly:
Your tapes may not be used in any way for broadcast,
television or submitted to a recording
company without written permission from myself
and the leaders of the group, John Davis and
Bessie Jones. This is copyright material and
their performances are also copyright. If I
sound severe it is not with the intention to be
accusatory, but because in this field there has
been an enormous amount of mishandling of casually
recorded tapes.

There is also a question in my mind whether it
was proper of you to have made this session without
payment to the artists.

Yours very truly,

Alan Lomax
