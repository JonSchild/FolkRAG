Scotland

5th January, 1952

Dear Calum,
     Thank you for your most
kind and encouraging letter. I left
Scotland frankly with mixed feelings,
but have none about the Maclean family
or about the Hebrides - both 100%.
     By the way, if you see Styth Thompson,
who I understand is in Sweden, tell him
that I would very much like to see him
before he leaves Europe to discuss my
project with him. I will be in Paris
now until the 15th of February, if that
would suit his convenience.
     I have come upon an American, named
Tracie, who has recorded in Sweden and
I will work out the Scandinavian album
with him. It would help if Swedish Radio
would be able to contribute a few
records. Would you speak to them about
it for me?
Yours ever,
Alan Lomax
