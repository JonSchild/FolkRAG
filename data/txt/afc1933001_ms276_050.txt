1. Union locals, immediately on organization, establish adjustment
committees.

They elect a permanent chairman of the adjustment committee
to whom complaints may be referred at all times.

They have regular, announced meetings to which employees 
may come with problems for adjustment and suggestions.

They make and keep regular appointments with administrators
for a continuing discussion of departmental conditions.

They insist on the right to appeal to administrators at any time 
that an emergency arises.

2. Local adjustment committees on receiving complaints from
employees investigate the facts in each situation, then decide on a
proper action. Grievances that are unique, in the sense that they 
apply to only one person, are recognized as such, but grievances
that disclose a general condition requiring correction are approached
with a view to a general remedy.

3. Once the grievance has been defined, the adjustment committees
takes it up with the supervisor directly concerned. Most
grievances end here, adjustments follow immediately and there is 
an end to them. But if the grievance is not settled there then
in an orderly step-by-step ascent the grievance is carried right up
the departmental ladder until it is adjusted. Orderly step-by-step
appeals are essential however. In no event does the adjustment
committee proceed to the top first. On the other hand the adjustment 
committee does not hesitate to go as high as is possible
to reach a satisfactory adjustment.

The United Federal Workers of America, in addition, endorses
the proposal for a Board of Appeals to adjudicate cases which
are impossible of adjustment within a department.

Federal administrators and federal employees have been acutely
aware of the need for such a board for a long time. Such a
boad is essential to a complete and effective system of personnel 
administration
