Interview With Albert Williams Jr.

If intelligence is something that can be displayed externally, expressed in general carriage, manner of speech, and in awareness of 
human courtesies, one may say that the seventeen year old student at 
the Coahoma County Training School on the King and Anderson plantation

Clarksdale:

in town.  He's really the richest Negro in town.  T. J. Huddleston 
got something too, but not as much as Thomas - cause he has quite a number of incomes; the burial association, property, plantation, restaurant - in fact that whole block where the 
burial association is belongs to him.

Negroes around our part sometimes set themselves aside.  Thomas
