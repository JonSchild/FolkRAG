A. The informant may have in his possession
manuscript copies of songs or handwritten
ledgers, diaries, cook books, and "ballet
books" with songs in them. These are
valuable not only for their texts but
as documents in the history of folk song
in America. Inquire after them and borrow
them for the purpose of making type-written
or photostat copies. Wherever
possible, arrange for the permanent
deposit of the originals in the Archive
of American Folk Song in the Library of
Congress.

B. At the close of the interview (not before)
ask for a snapshot or for permission to
take one. As this is a matter that requires
considerable tact and discretion,
it is left to your good taste and judgment.
