Dear Alan:  Macmillan's folder
of reviews of Our Singing Country
contains not one unfavorable comment,
and they come from all
over the country except the deep
South where we remain unknown.
I am sending you copies of
a few where Macmillan had duplicates.
Lewis Gannett of the "New 
York Tribune" is the most extravagant,
of course unfair to you,
though another reviewer evens up
when he compares you to Carl
Sandburg.

On the next recording trip, if
you still wish me to make it,
you are right in saying that I
should go in my automobile.
In advance you should do several

over
