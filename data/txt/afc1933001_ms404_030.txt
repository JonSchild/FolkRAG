This evening, our father,
We begin before death in early judgement.
This evening, our father,
I come in the humblest manner I ever knowed
Or ever thought it
To bow.

I'm thankin' thee, O Lord,
That my laying down last night
Wasn't my cooling board,
And my cover was not my winding sheet.

O Lord, thanking thee, this evening, my father,
That my dressing room this morning was not my grave.

O Lord, thanking thee this evening, my Father,
That my slumber last night was not for eternity.

O Lord
Just bless the widows and orphans in this land,
I Pray thee in Jesus' name;
Take care of them, my father,
And guide them;
And then, my father,
When they all is standing in glory,
And thou art satisfied at my staying here,
O meet me at the river, I ask in thy name.
Amen.
