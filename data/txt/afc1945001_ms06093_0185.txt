"The husband of a friend of mine is just back from Panama and Africa,
although he's not telling much about that part of it. But he says he is
simply incredulous at the lackadaisical attitude of the people in this
country on the war - that something is going to have to be done to wake
them up and make them realize what an awful thing it is."
