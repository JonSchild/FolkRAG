Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery 
Madison, Wisconsin

Dear Alan:

You should know by now that we pay salaries on the 15th of 
the month and so your check was air-mailed to you to Ironwood, 
Michigan.  I hop you receive it without much delay.  I am sending
this to Madison, Wisconsin, and I hope it reaches you. (There 
are many Madisons in this country, so please be careful in sending
us instructions). 
I should like to have some definite information regarding 
you plans as soon as possible.  There are many things brewing for
the Archive right now and I cannot take any action on them until
I know about when you will be here and about when the machine may
be ready for other work.  Father sin Lubbock you know, and willing
and anxious to do something for us in the southwest.  But this 
is just one of the things which makes me make this request. 

Sincerely, 

Harold Spivacks
Chief, Division of Music
