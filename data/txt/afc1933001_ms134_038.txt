Dear Mr. Lomax:

We are delighted that you can be with us this
week. An informal program is being planned for Saturday
night at which time it would be fine to have you. However,
we are planning on featuring you Sunday. The program at the 
school is very informal. There will likely bemany girls
who would like to sing Sunday morning but Sunday afternoon
at about 3.00 we would like to gather the whole school together.
At this timeit would be fine if you could describe
your work and give us background for the development of
this phase of American culture. It would be fine to go from
that point with singing and records. Since this is a workers'
school we are especially interested in the songs that
deal with the labor movement. Many girls are interested in
doing a living newspaper of a history of labor, and if you
have songs that would fit in to this, it would be most valuable.

We are glad that your wife can be with you and 
we will welcome you and your friends. We will be prepared to
take care of you for the night. When you arrive come directly
to Merion Hall. Someone there will direct you where to
go.

Sincerely yours,
Signature
Marguerite I. Gilmore, Director
