Reverend Roe, Reel 2, P. 6

Well, when they refused to ordain me, I went to this church that I had
the dream about. They ordained me. I went on and taken that church,
and I moved that church down where I planted that tree. And that
church growed, and before the people knew what I was doing there, I
had a church equal to any church in the city. Yes, sir, there was
something that led me and led me.
A:  What did you think the dream meant? What did those little queer
pools of water mean, did you think?
R:  I think that meant 'twas my ministry of life -- sometimes things
would be clear and sometimes muddy; I believe that was what it meant.
And it's been like that.
A:  And why do you think you went down in the suth part of town?
R:  Well, my dream. Yeah, and because I dreamed I set a tree out
down there. Well, I didn't have that in mind when I went, but after
I went, the church began to grow, you know, and thrive. Then it
come to me about that tree, and the Lord leads me now, I guess.
And so I built the church down there, and I just had a fine time
until I got ready to go -- I was called to another church and left.
Other ministers came to hire me, and they said it was a mighty good
church. So, before I went, I come back for to see the church. There's
a preacher had split the church, taken this little church off from it,
you know, and that was why they would recognize the call, you see.
So, after I'd built that church down on the corner, the preacher
and they fell out, he'd taken sick, and they sent him out of the
pulpit right on the street, on the cot, when he was able to go --
the deacons did.
Soon after that, they lost the church, and this church that I built
and they own it now. And it's a good church, thriving and well.
Yes.
A:  Well, after all, it proves that the Lord was leading you
