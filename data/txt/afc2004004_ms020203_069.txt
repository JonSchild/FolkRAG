A:  When he did have something to say, what did he say, what
kind of things did he talk about? Tell you any stories
about himself.
V:  He told us one time he used to have a mighty hard time
when he was a boy comin up. He'd tell us things in the
winter time when we'd be in the house. (815) And he said
that he was a ba-d boy, he was kind of a mischievous boy.
Said that he would fight boys, fool em off in the woods,
make like he was goin to hunt scaly barks and hickory nuts
and git the smaller children way out in the woods and he'd
fight um, just beat um out there with sticks and things like
that. And he say, when he got to be bout eighteen years old,
eighteen or nineteen I believe he said, a young man, said,
he played ball ha-rd one day, played baseball real hard.
Said he come home that night and he lied down said
his mother had cooked some pepper grass with some meal dumplins
in it, his mama used to make um a lot of times. . .
     They said that he eat too much of those dumplins-- they's
toogreasy, they said. He say he lie down on the bed. The
house always had big cracks in it. It rained in it. They
stayed in a big old barn-lookin' place down there. And he
say he was lyin there in the bed and he dont know whether he
was sleep or no. Anyhow he said he saw three little folks
come up to one of those cracks, but mama said he wasn doin
nothin but dreamin, but he clares befo God he wasn sleep. . .
