[*(MUCK)*]
BJ:   Yeah.  I guess they would, my God, yeah!  Trucks an' cars,
all down in them fields. . .Uh, le' me tell ya -- An' that muck!
Ow, Lawd.  An' the muck's is a black stuff an', jus' you ridin'
along?   You can be out there on that highway, ridin', an' you
stayin' here or standin' here -- that muck will shake this whole
house.   I mean. . .when you're when you're ridin' along.
(MACHINE TURNED OFF AND THEN:)

[*(FOOD IN FIELD, CONT.)*]
TL:   They were sellin' in the field.
BJ:   And, and how they make good money sellin' in the field if
you wanna sell[, ya know?] in the field.   Somebody gonna sell in the field, 'cause
that, that is a good problem, ya know.   An' some peoples be old and
some is sick an' some not able to pick beans an' stoop an' some
jus' ain't gone do it an' some know that's the best point, an'
so, it's jus' somebody gonna be sellin'.   You see?  An' so that's just
a real good idea ev-- anyhow, to do.
       You have little ups and downs[, but] with selling.  'Cause sometimes
peoples come to the truck an', an' wanna gas about diffrunt
things.  But just don't pay him no mind.  Jus' like runnin' a sto',
tha's all.
       And, and. . .You know some of those folks got trucks, long
trucks, and hit's. . .an' got it covered over the top, an' got
stove in there.  An' cook your food hot.   Brother, that's cool,
then, I'm tellin' you.   You go there an' buy your hot, hot, hot
dogs an' hot fish.  Already, I mean cooked right then.  They
bring it out, ya know, with the meal, jus' like us do when us
go fish fry.   We carry our meal.  An' salted the meal before ya
leave home.   Pepper your meal before ya leave home.  An' clean
your fish.   Nothin' to do but to heat the grease an' dip it into
the meal an' put it into the, into the grease.  That's the way
we do when we go fish fries, see?  We, um-hum, yeah.
