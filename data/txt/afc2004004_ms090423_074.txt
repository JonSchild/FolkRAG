of the families on the church roll, participated in the church programs actively.  This seems to indicate that relatively a small number of the individuals are under the direct influence of the church.  
This may also mean that the disciplinary measures of the church is on 
the decline.

There is an ample evidence that the younger people, having acquired a greater accessibility to the city, are losing much of their interests in the church.  They are largely indifferent either as to the necessity of joining the church or, if they are already the members
as to the putting out of the church.  Joe Batts, who is twelve years old, comments:

My folks took me to church near 'bout every Sunday that the weather be good.  Used to like getting all dressed up in my Sunday clothes to go to church.

Now I don't go no more.  Naw, there ain't no harm in not 
going.  Well, we got a pretty good preacher but he ain't

The attitude of the youth toward the minister may be gained from noting the numerous comments and stories floating in the community 
about them.  These comments ridicule ministers; they picture them as 
"worldly" men.  One story runs as follows:

A group of boys were shooting marbles on a Sunday morning.  
It just happened that the preacher came by, and he told the 
boys that they ought to be ashamed of themselves, down there shooting marbles on a Sunday.
He told them, "You ought to be praying, and trying to go 
to heaven."
Finally the preacher decided to go, and he asked the boys, 
"Say, where is the Post Office?"
