I worked so regular,
And I worked so long,
[& it W] worked so long
Til I lost the use
of [M]my right arm.
If the sun shine hot,
And the day [real] stay long,
I'm gonna take two shady bushes
To be my home.
Oh, Lord [will] gon’ be my home.

I [will] whip put my woman
[to sing a tree] With a single tree.
You ought to hear her hollerin’ —
"Don't you murder me!"
That rot-gut whiskey
Is [gonna] have kill me dead,
[Oh] How kill me dead.

[Y]you bring me some water,
And the hammer knock out my brains.
That rot-gut whiskey
About to kill me dead.
