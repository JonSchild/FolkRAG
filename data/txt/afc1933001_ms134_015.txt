Proposed that these records be shipped to New York, copied by me at 
my expense, returned to Washington; That after I have used them in my
English program I should return them with any transcriptions
of the program that have been made and turn these over to the Library
of Congress to release or retain at the discretion of the Librarian; also
that I shall not use these records for any other purpose than that of
playing in my series of programs during July, August and September, 1938
over the British Broadcasting Corporation.
Signed,
Alfred Alistair Cooke.
