were born in Roumania - told us that everyone thought
the war wouldn't come off for another month now.
He said Hungary & Poland & Germany would ally against
Cz-. But the way it looks now (this is 
my observation) it seems like Germany is going
to get Czechoslovakia the same way she did Austria
by a process of gradual demorilization. Michael Wallace
was in Austria the day before the Auschluss
and he said that all the members of the Fatherland
Front were absolutely off their heads with
fright. People called them up every hour all night
long saying Tomorrow you will be dead. And that
had been going on for months until they just
couldn't think of anything to do. He said they would
all sit around saying the situation is very serious,
we must do something. But then they couldn't
think of anything.

I wish you would send me the words to Iron-
Head's Once I Knowed an Old Lady, just the part between
"She couldn't find but 2 marrow bones" and 
the verse beginning "She got way back, took a little
running start" I think there's just two verses in between
and I can't remember them. And please, Sudie's
& Steve's address. I love you both so much. Write soon.
