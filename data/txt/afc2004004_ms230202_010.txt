BLUES - 7

SID:  (cont)  So those things like that --- I wonder is-is that the cause why the
blues?  Uh-why a man have the blues --- is on account of he can't
make the support for his family (which he do love) an'-uh-an' he's
gotta go 'n' do things he don' want to do to make a livin', --- is
that why the blues is?
NACHEZ:  Well-uh, I'll tell you, Sid. . 'r instance, like you say about church.
Well-er, the blues and-er (to my idea now), the blues and-er spirituals
are somewhat on the same order.  I mean, if you have troubles. .
SID:  Yah.
NACHEZ:  . .if you have trouble you go to church and you sing, you feel happy. .
SID:  That's right.
NACHEZ:  . .an' I mean you gets a little consolation there.
SID:  That's right.
NACHEZ:  Well, it's the same with the blues, I mean a blues is just a something
like a spiritual.
