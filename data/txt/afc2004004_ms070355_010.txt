I declare I ain gon be back no mo'
crepe on yo' do.
I've done all could to get along with you
[Now look it here] please don't dog me round
bad luck town
Went in my room & I sunk down & cried
I didn't have no blues, but I just wasn't satisfied
- me to do
just to go get along wid you
back no mo
crepe an yo do
I cried last night & all night the night before
I'm gon take my & I won't have to cry no mo
Sun gonna shine in my back do some day
blow my blues away
(harmonica like [?] of a wild & sorrowful
wind, guitar like heart stopping, like trees being
torn up by their roots).
