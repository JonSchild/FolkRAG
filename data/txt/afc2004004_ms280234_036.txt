often sit around band like the County Armagh. I
often spoke to them about that. I said, "Wel, you can ridicule anybody -
say something about anybody or say something about even
myself; you talk about myself or say anything about me, it wouldn't
worry me one bit. If you said to me now, "You don't look nice. You're
teeth are horrible looking" --it wouldn't worry me in the least. If
you said, "Well, Im going to take a photograph of you, well
supposing you took a picture and said, "You don't look nice, or
you're horrible looking." Well, do you know, that wouldn't
interest me - I wouldn't be interested in that sort of thing.
Good looking or bad looking, that wouldn't sorry me. But the music
and the song - that's all.
Lomax: Margaret, tell me about when you were born. - Your brothers and
sisters, your father and mother, Start from the beginning.
Barry: Well, I was born on June 1st 1917 in the city of Cork.
Peters Street. My mother and father was married seventeen years and
there was five in the family of us. But I don't remember them. I 
wasn't in existence when they were alive. I had one sister three
years old, and I don't even remember her, but I remember her by
the picture. It's an extraordinary thing, and I often ask people
so many times. And I looked up to the same picture, many and many a
time before I left the city, before my father walked out, and there
was the photo of her taken dead in a couch, just like I'm sitting

they take the photograph dead - of a dead child ,like ?" And they
said that it was a very extraodinary thing and they never gave me
any more information about it. Well, nother was 17 years married to
my father. I remember her up to 12 years old. Any further than that,
I just saw her dying, you know.
Lomax: What was she like ?
Barry:Oh, very lovely woman. Beautiful. You know, I dont think
there's a lovelier woman that ever can be got in Cork. Lovely
black hair, you know. It isn't the way she used to wear it, was
different from modern type now, she used to wear it in a plait
right around her hair like that, in a plait, and she used to get it
up in a big bun in he back; what they calla bun. That's you roll
your hair up hree of four times up in a hump at the back and
stick a hairpin in it. She was five feet eleven. That's an
extraordinary height for a woman, five feet eleven. And she was
11 1/2 stone in weight. That's not my won side of the story. That's
my father; he was always telling me ,like. Because I'll tell you.
When she got sick, you know, she was took ill, you see, and she had
double pneumonia several times. I wanted to tell you the truth;
to be truthful. My mother died in bad health, you know. She really
