WORKERS' LULLABYE
(Tune: Rock-a-bye Baby)

Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top,
When you grow up, you, you'll work in a shop,
When you get married, your wife will work too,
So that the rich will have nothing to do.

Hush-a-bye baby, on the tree top,
When you grow old, your wages will stop. 
When you have spend the little you've [have]
Hush-a-bye baby, off to the grave.


MARCH SONGS OF THE WORKERS

Whirl-winds of danger are raging around us,
O'erwhelming forces of darkness avail,
Still in the fight see advancing before us
Our lag of liberty that yet shall prevail.

CHORUS
Then forward, ye workers, freedom awaits you,
O'er all the world on the land and the sea.
On with the fight for the cause of humanity,
March, march, ye toilers, and the world shall
          be free.

Women and children in hunger are calling,
Shall we be silent to their hunger and woe,
While in the fight see our brothers are falling, 
Up then united, and conquer the foe.

(Chorus)

Off with the crown of the tyrants of favor;
Down in the dust with the prince and the peer;
Strike off your chains, all ye brave sons of labor,
Wake all humanity, for victory is near.

(Chorus)
