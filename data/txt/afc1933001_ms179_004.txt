Dear Dr. Spivacke:

You requested me to give you my opinion of the value of the
project discussed in Mr. Bond's letter.

As you are award, the Negro people of the United States 
possess a large, impressive, beautiful and highly fertile folk
music of their own.  They are talented singers and composers of
songs.  I believe that Mr. Bond's folk festival would help to
release this musical energy within the camps and would greatly
stimulate its development there in terms of song-making and song
singing.  This festival would serve to point a finger of approval
and recognition at this tasic type of Negro musical activity, and
I think would stimulate the growth of similar type of entertainment
both in other communities and other camps.  It might well
mean, besides, that white soldiers would attempt to emulate the 
folk festivals of the Negro troops, and the ideal would thus
be broadcast throughout the service.

This beneficial effect would be greatly enhanced if recordings
were made of Mr. Bond's festival and these records were made
available in other camps, both to the soldiers and their officers,
as a working model of what can be accomplished by the use of
native talent.

Respectfully yours,
