Dear Allen, I got your Letter 
about the 10 Ult. Sorry I could not 
send that record sooner, but 
to day was just as soon as I could
fool with it all. But its now

and packing .50 in all C.O.D. 2.06.
I surely do hope you are pleased 
with it.  Now the Beauty of the matter 
is it was written by Ga Negro

Part of the Country at that time.
But its been written & Rewritten till 
we cant well tell the author, If it was 
necessarry. Hope it suits you Let me hear
