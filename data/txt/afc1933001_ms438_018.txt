[*Lead Belly*]

L.B. Speaks:  The blues is comin' down like a shower of rain....
This song is made about an old man an' a woman.,
This old man wanted to marry this woman. An' she didn'
want but she married him [*anyhow*] for [his money] the money that
he had. An' she thought she had got av'y dollar that he had,-
but she was a li'l' mistaken. An' yit unstill she had him
pretty well bent* [* *"Bent," "Broke." *]. She had got so much of it, it was worryin'
him. An; she was fixin' to leave him. He was settin' wid
his head hung down-- what I mean he had his min' concentrated
-- an' she pass him by an' ask him, say,"Daddy what de matter
wid you?" He look up at her an' he commence a-cryin',

L.B. Sings: "Settin' down here won'd'in' would a match-box hol'
my clo's?
Settin' down here won'd'in' would a match-box hol' my clo's?
Settin' down here won'd'in' would a match-box hol' my clo's?"

L.B. Speaks: She says, "Daddy, what in the worl' de use for you cryin'
like that fer? What in de worl' you got on your min?"
He sit down an' 'gin to worry agin:

L.B. Sings:  "I don' want to be bothered wid no suitcase on my road,
I don' want to be bothered wid no suitcase on my road,
I don' want to be bothered wid no suitcase on my road."

L.B. Speaks: She walked up to him an' put her arm aroun' him. He looked
up at her an' said,"I'm goin' down to see my frien' an'
see what would he do if his baby's packin' up her trunk?"
He walked down to his friend's house an' here what he asked his
friend,

L.B. Sings: "What would you do when your gal's packin' up her trunk?
What would you do when your gal's packin' up her trunk?
What would you do when your gal's packin' up her trunk?"

L.B. Speaks. HIs frien' run out an' tole him the bes' aggvice he
could:

L.B. Sings: "Get you a half a gallon o' whiskey an' git on you a big
drunk,
Get you a half a gallon o' whiskey an' git on you a big
drunk,
Get you a half a gallon o' whiskey an' git on you a big
drunk."

L.B. Speaks: He goes on back home. He had two chillun there-- a lil' bot an'
a lil' girl. De lil' girl could play a piano but de lil' boy
couldn'. The woman run an' got her daughter an' says,
"Daughter, play me a piece on de piano." The lil' girl
sit down an' 'gin' to whip it to a gravy----(Guitar picking
the same melody on the harmonics as L.B. [*Lead Belly*] used in Blind
Lemon except the guitar[, of course,] is tuned differently.)
