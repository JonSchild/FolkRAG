His draft board ask him, what class, he wish
to be in, he answer in reply, I want to be
in class B. Be heah the day they leave
And be heah when the dey come back. 

Buck private Pete was in charge of the 
cooking once. So there was a German
prison so Pete told him to peel potatoes
and when the German finish he had
peel them so thick so Pete said go look
over and peel them peeling again you 
understand you are not in Germany. 

When you buy stamps buy at least four
we'll have enough bombs to finish Tokyo

Buy a stamp buy a bond to skin that skunt
across the pond. "Hitler". 

Lets get down to business and brass taxes
I think all us women need to join the 
wack

They are rationing coffee, they are rationing 
meat and now they are rationing 
them things that go on your feet
(shoes)
