So up the stairs and into bed, let me get my right leg over,
I'll take a crack at your maiden head,
I pushed the bugger through to the Straits of Dover.

3) Suddenly a footstep on the stair,
Who should it be but the one-eyed Riley,
With two pistols in his hand
Looking for the man that had fucked his daughter.

4) I took O'Riley by the balls,
Rammed his head in a pail of water,
Stuffed the pistols up his arse,
A bloody-sight stiffer than I'd screwed his daughter.

Pleasant and Delightful:
1) 'Twas pleasant and delightful on a fine summer's morn, 
When the fields and the meadows they were covered in corn,
The blackbirds and thrushes sang on a green tree,
And the larks they sang melodious at the dawn of the day.

2) Said the sailor to his true love as they walked that day,
Said the sailor, "I must leave you, I'm going far away.
I am going to the Indias where the loud cannons roar,
I must go and leave me Nancy, she's the girl I adore."

3) Then the ring from her finger she has instantly drew, 
Saying "Take this, dearest Willy and my heart shall prove true.
And while he embraces her, tears from her eyes fell,
Said, "May I go along with you ?" "O no, love, farewell."

4) "Fare-ye-well, lovely Nancy, I no longer can stay,
For the topsails they're hoisted and the anchor's aweigh.
Our ship lies a-waiting for the next flowing tide,
And if ever I return again I will take you my bride.

2) I makit a cradle on the tree top.
And the wind it did blow and the cradle did rock. (Cho.)
