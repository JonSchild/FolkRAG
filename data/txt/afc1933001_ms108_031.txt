Hang on to my letters will you. I'd like to have
them when I come back. 

Innsbruck, Austria
May 11, 1938

Dearest Alan & Elizabeth,
When we pulled into the station this morning
we were greeted by a city hall or something - or - other
completely [draped] swathed in red with pennants and flags
and draperies of various sorts dripping off the
sides and swastikas plastered everywhere. And
fifteen minutes later while Elizabeth and I
were wandering in search of the local Jugenherberge
we met a whole column of brown
shirts marching into town, singing. It was
quite impressive. Everyone here wears a little
swastika pin or flies one from his baby-
carriage or embroiders it on his sofa-pillows.
The conversion of Austria has been swift and
efficient. I passed a wall with various childrens
chalk-drawings on it today - a majority of them
had large noses. Letters sent use German stamp
and give return addresses as Vienna, Germany. 
It's quite incredible. I almost got knocked down
twice today by two brown-shirted gentlemen, I
don't know any German except Thank-you and 
How much, so I refrained from comment.
Elizabeth and I, Father and Deanie are like the two
ends of a pair of sugar tongs- we're hard to get together.
