the recording, too, seems 
to me good. Wait and 
let me play 'em and 
tell you the stories of 
some of the records.

Bess is in the Infirmary 
again.  I wish you 
would write to her She 
takes after you in her 
reckless disregard of 
prudence in taking care 
of her own health.
Where duty or inclination 
or willfulness beckons
otherwhere.
