Roll 54 Stan and Hattie Hicks 1

Stan: When you stay in these mountains up here it gets pretty rough, you
got to be pretty tough to stay with it. (AL: Start again)
When you come in here in the wintertime why it's pretty rough. The snow
got up to my shop's upper door, 13 foot. And there come a helicopter here,
and it went up in the field up there, that you're looking at. And they had

You could see 'em goin' to these houses like pack rats, carrying that stuff
out....it just fell flat four feet deep.
