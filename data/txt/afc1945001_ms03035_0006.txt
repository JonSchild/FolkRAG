Mrs. Rose Faber, President, conducted an elaborate propaganda
campaign and spent a great deal of money prior to Pearl Harbor. Since
that time, however, her group appears to be less active. Actually, Mrs.
Faber is reported to be very busy conducting quiet, "unorganized
get-togethers." She prides herself on her ability to spread rumors
and to encourage others of her kind to do likewise.
