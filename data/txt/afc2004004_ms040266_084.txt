Dear Mr. Burt,

          I am so sorry I have postponed all my letter
 writing till I have completed a succession 
of programmes. Thank you very much for your nice
 letter on the Alan Lomax programmes. I have passed 
it on to Alan because I think it may interest him and 
it certainly sounds like an interesting story. We
must talk about it when you are in London again.
                                                          Yours sincerely,

                                                           Marjorie Banks.
