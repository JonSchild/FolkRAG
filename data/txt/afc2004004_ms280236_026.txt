3) From Holland we steered, but the tempest did roar,
And the lightning flashed round us when far from the shore,
The mast and the rigging were torn to the waves,
And with them went father to a watery grave.
4) I jumped overbaord in the wild, raging main,
To save my poor father, but all was in vain,
I clasped his cold form but quite lifeless was he,
And swept from my arms he sand down in the sea.
5) I clung to a plank and was soon washed ashore,
With the sad news to tell them that he was no more,
When she heard it, poor mother, of grief she did die,
And all alone left me, so pity poor I.
6) A lady of fortune she heard me complain,
And she gave me shelter from wind and from rain,
She said, "I've no child, for all that I've tried,
So this poor smuggler boy in my bosom shall bide."
Robts: That song's as old as the hills. I believe it goes
back to about sixteen hundred.
Lomax: And you got it when you were a kid, I guess, didn't
you?
Robts: Yes. I don't remember where I learnt it. I've known
it all me life. I think father used to sing it, and 
I think mother did, too.
Lomax: This song is very popular and very much liked by
all your friends down there in. . .
Robts: Yes, well, because it's a local song, see. Because
most of the families down there are pretty old
families, and you haven't to go back very far before
you found a grandfather that did a little bit of
running as well -- and certainly great-grandfather
did, and all the seafraing families down there were
mixed up with the smuggling trade. They built those
two cottages between me and the sea for coastguards to
stop the smuggling in Pinmill.
Lomax: When was that?
Robts: In eighteen. . .in eighteen eighty-seven. They built
a couple of cottages there because there was so
much being run into Pinmill Hard.
