BJ TAPE 7A, p. 132

     I told 'im, "Yeah." [I sat down] So I get in the car an' I rode on
with 'im. And a lil' piece...
     By the time we heard somebody holler we seed somebody running.
Just ahead of us, you know, just up ahead of us. An' I look, I
say, "That's Mr. Bob." Thats the oldest colored man on, at that
place, the only was there when we, when we went there. He was
hollering an' hollering. An' I said, "Mr. Williams, that [must be]
Mr. Bob."
     And he drove up fast, an' that sandy hill, he drove up fast.
That man was                  on runnin'! Said, "Well, what ail 'im?"
He, he was tall an', an' goin' up [the] a hill, tha's all; we was
lookin' at him. An' him...when we drove up that hill, we looked.
There's a crocodile in behind 'im.
     Well, dontcha know, if I'd a-walked on up in a hurry, you
know, like I was goin', because they'll git at women more than
they will at men, that thing a'd (would have) ate me up. Ya see?
An' that crocodile was so close to that man, an' he was...Brother,
he was natchully runnin'. And he was hollerin' and he was runnin'.
     He had been there all that time. Ya see, the storm had
drove all these things. He was goin', [I guess] from one water,
I guess, to the other. An' he took out behin' that man. He was
near to his heels. Mr. Williams stopped the car an' jumped
out an' took his gun an' leveled on it. Shot him right, [through]
right through the head! Man, I was scared he was gonna shoot
Mr. Bob. But the way he did it, he had to run around where he
could shoot 'im on the side. He was jes'...Mr. Bob was tryin'
to turn up into the mango grove. Boy! An' he was hollerin'.
An' all he did, all he did, he was 'bout to give down. He was a 
Southern man, too, ya know. And, and he, and he shot 'im an'
killed 'im. That was jes' how close...
