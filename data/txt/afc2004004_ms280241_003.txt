3) The landlady opened the door and come in with a smile,
    She lifted a chair with freedom and air.
    "Here's health to the lass who can jug it in style."

4) "O bring us some liquor," the lassie she cried,
    "To cheer up his spirirts, - I doubt they are low.
    For it's no when you're d ad. Bring a bottle or two
    To the bonnie wee lassie who never said no."

5) The drink she took, it beingthe best of gin,
    Me being myself, and sober to be,
    For it's glass to glass so merrily did toast
    To the lass and the lad that found himself fu'.

6) "Look into my pocket," the lassie she said,
    "There are two-and-six to pay for your bed.
    Andfor laying me down you owe me a crown,
    Look into my pocket," the lasie she says.

7) I put my hand in her pocket and five pounds I took,
    Say I to mesel' "I will bundle and go."
    And I bade her goodbye, but she made no reply,
    This bonnie wee lassie that never said no.

The Handsome Cabin Boy:

1) It's a pretty fair maid I'll let youse understand,
    She had a mind for roving to some foreign land. 
    She dressed in sailor's clothes and boldly did appear,
    Engaging with the captain, given service for a year.

2) For the wind it being in favour and we soon set off to sea,
    The Lady to the Captain said, "My love I wish you joy.
    That you have engaged such a handsome cabin boy."

3) For his cheeks appeared like roses and his side-looks they did curl,
    For oftentimes the sailor smiled and said he looked like a girl.
    But biting cabin biscuits his curls did destroy,
    And the wind did swell our pretty belle, our handsome cabin boy.

4) "O doctor, O doctor," the cabin boy did cry.
    The sailors swore with all their might that their cabin boy would die.
    But the doctor ran with all his might, he was smiling at the fun,
    For to think a sailor lad would have a daughter or a son.

5) But when the sailors hear the joke they all began to stare,
    For the child belongs to none of us, how solemn they did swear.
    But the lady andthe Captain they have oftimes kissed and toyed,
    So we'll soon find out the secret of our handsome cabin boy.
