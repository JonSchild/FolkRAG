Dear Mrs. Seeger: Alan won't answer 
my letter about whether I owe you 
money. Columbia has renewed their contract 
with me and have made the
first payment. When you took over
a 1/3 interest in Alan's book were you 
properly credited and was this amount 
$79.25 marked down to you? Or do I 
still owe you? 

Have you read Adventures of a 
Ballad Hunter? What do you think 
of my swan song? My best love
to all the Seegers and Miss Terrill's
too. Your Friend, 
John. Lomax
