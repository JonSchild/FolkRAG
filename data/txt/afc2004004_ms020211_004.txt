of her helper. 7   She told me early in our association.   "You'll get 
more out of this than I will."   And this was before we had decided 
that our specific task would be to produce a record to accompany 
her book Step It Down. I did not understand until much later what 
she meant.
     One of Bessie's main concerns was to convey
the feeling of the old people who first begun these songs-what brought 
them out under hardships, and crying-ship, and suffering.  And God 
handed it down to them in the midst of all the moaning and groaning.
     The old folks everywhere had that same good feeling, and spiritual 
minds, and deep thoughts. And you could see into it that they meant it. 
There were hard pressure things that came over them, you know, and they 
weren't doing this here to just say they were singing.   They weren't just 
trying to be heard, to be seen, the spirit within them was crying out, was 
singing the grievances and whatnot.   And that makes a difference. Every 
one of these old songs when done right is different.   There are real 
differences in the tunes, a difference in how they're supposed to 
be carried."
      Through their singing of certain songs and telling of certain 
stories, the black people talked to the white man. Bessie's grandfather 
told her many of the specific meanings. In the song " Throw 
Me Anywhere Lord," for example, Bessie recalled that they were 
saying, " You might as well throw me out in the old field, 'cause you 
ain't doing me right no how."9   Then she tells about the contrast 
between the elaborate burial practices of white folks and the simple 
rites allowed the slaves.   The meaning of the line, "The bull cow 
kicking off the milk cow's horn," was that whatever the black man 
(the milk cow) created, the white man (the bull cow) took from him. 
Bessie's own comment was, "So with everything the Negro man did, 
if the white man got it he kept it because we have the best."10
     Other messages given to Bessie from the old folk were life 
lessons: help one another, don't let someone use you twice, don't 
pretend to be sick, don't get angry when people borrow and don't 
return.   One of Bessie's own messages, resulting from her involvement 
in the Civil Rights movement, was the implicit lesson of the 
game "Alabama, Mississippi."
      Alabama, Mississippi, Alabama, New Orleans, Alabama,
            number one.
       You gotta shake, shake, shake, shake it baby,
       Shake. shake, shake, shake it baby,
        Shake it back to New Orleans.
But the most important thing is that they know what I mean. I tell them 
before we start. Not the body, 'cause you're gonna shake that anyhow, but 
your brain, your mind, your understanding, the life you have to live these 
days. Shake it off. 11
      Some of Bessie's songs were recreational as well as functional, 
like "Shoo, Turkey," which called for an imitation of the [?????] 
actually gathering turkeys from the woods, or the game "Bob-a-Needle." 
But even for those songs that Bessie would call "just 
games," she had a pedagogical purpose-to teach a child coordination 
or self-confidence, as well as about the nature of human 
relationships.
  Most important, whatever the message, no matter how serious 
or how practical, the overriding tone of her teaching was always
positive. She taught one not only how to survive, but how to 
overcome difficulty and to live well in accordance with a higher 
reality.
  Bessie was well suited for her life's work. She loved music and 
children. She loved to travel and to teach and reach people. Her 
sensitivity to others was astounding, whether on a one-to-one basis 
or with a large audience. As she expressed it,

On the programs when I'm leading the songs and games, I do it according 
to the congregation. I don't mean to size . . . I know some folks write down 
what they're going to do . . . but I just don't see it being done that way. 
'Cause see, the gun isn't loaded, and you can't be loading it yourself and 
unloading it as you go along.12

  Bessie grew up in a rich, musical culture. In addition to the 
musical members of the Sampson family, she recalled that her 
Uncle Gene, some of whose songs she also sang, was an excellent 
guitar player.13  All the men in the family played guitar or banjo, 
and they made their own banjos. Jet made his own bam-bams, 
played the accordion, and made "great big African banjos" out of 
wood, putting rattlesnake rattles in them. Her mother played the 
autoharp. 14  Her childhood was a full one: There was always 
church. Then there was as well a variety of secular entertainments, 
such as egg-crackings, taffy pulls, frolics, games, going to the shows 
that came to town, buck-dancing, reels, rags, and just sitting and 
swapping songs. 
  Bessie's musicality as a child was well known. 15 She was actively 
interested in the singing she heard in her community, and was 
always trying to remember songs and finding that she could do so 
easily. Her motivation and her talent were coupled with the conscious
need to practice. When she would hear a new song that she 
wanted to "catch," she told me how she would listen to it as many 
times as circumstances would allow and then go over and over it, 
"until I've got it just like I want it." Sometimes this would mean a 
change in the original version. In the game "Green Fields, Roxie," 
for example, she changed the kiss at the end to a handshake 
because, "I didn't like it."16
  After she had had stage and recording experience, she was 
always conscious of the importance of attending to technical 
equipment and details. As much as possible she would try to
