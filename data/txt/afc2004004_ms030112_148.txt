MRS. DAVIS:
we will never remember. So many can't remember. Kept it all in his head.
LARRY:
You know what I like about him, when he would tell a story something like that, I mean you could just see it happening, it wasn't like somebody telling you a lie they wanted you to believe, you know, it was as if you were there, you know. You wouldn't have to use no imagination with it. You see, it really happened.
MRS. DAVIS:
I'm just sorry he's not here today to tell it.
LARRY:
Oh Rev. Davis is here now, Man.
MRS. DAVIS:
He could think of more things. He carried everything in his head. Songs everything, jokes. All of a sudden I be talking, he would tell it again in the same way.
LARRY:
Then it would be just as funny,
MRS. DAVIS:
Well he wouldn't change it, he would keep it the same way. Some people after telling it and would have to tell it again would tell it in a different way. The same way everytime.
LIONEL:
Larry, do you remember any other stories he told, cause he had such good stories.
