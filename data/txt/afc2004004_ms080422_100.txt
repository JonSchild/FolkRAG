Tape:  898 Nimrod Workman 1
Nimrod:  (sings)  LORD BATESON

There lived a man, a man of honor,
Noble man of high degree
Who could not. . . .be contented
Til he sailed a voyage all over seas

And he sailed east and he sailed west
Sailed out here to some Turkey shore
There was he caught and put in prison
For seven long years to stay or more.

They bored a hole through his left shoulder
Tied it to a lustrous tree
And threw him into the dungeon cell
Where daylight he might never see.

And it so came he had a daughter
Noble daughter of high degree
She stole the key to her father's prison
And vowed Lord Bateson, she'd set him free.

Stepped in front of him, said; (spoken)
Honey, have you land, or have you living
Are you living of a high degree?
What would you give to a Turkish lady
Out of this prison would set you free.

Oh, many times. . . . . the gold and silver (spoken)
He said honey I got gold and I've got silver
I am living with a high degree
But I'd give my all to a Turkish lady
Out of these prisons would set me free.

She took him to her father's. . . . . . . .
Poured him a glass of strongest wine
And as she drunk unto him
Saying Lord Bateson, I wish you was mine.

Shuslempine(?) was her name (spoken)
Shushlempine, she had a ship
Set it all floating on the deep.
Ship Lord Bateson across the sea
And she wished him safe to his own country.

She stepped in front of him (spoken)
Honey I got a bargain to make with you
