Song Number 2 which baffles me is "Forty
Years a Cowpuncher." I know [Iv] I've heard that
title somewhere, but I can't find it, in either of
your collections nor in any other in the New York
Public Library.

Said Mr. Abbott: "I wrote that song." And
he gave me the stanzas which I repeat below. What
about this? Old-timers occasionally fall into the
error of telling stories in the [per] first person
that belong in the third, but I've never known
Teddy Blue to do this. Is there any other version
of "Forty Years a Cowpuncher" beside the following
one? Do you know of any reason why he couldn't
have written it? Has it been published?

Come all you wild young cowpunchers
Wherever you may be,
Come one come all, come right here now
And listen unto me.
It's concerning Larry Wolverston,
A bold rider was he
Who came some forty years ago
From Memphis, Tennessee
Chorus
He was 40 years a cowpuncher
He never done things by halves.
And his last words on his dying bed
Was Let's cut out the cows and calves.

2
He labored hard for 3 long years
For the ST cow outfit
And let me say from the very first day
They never asked him to quit.
He made it his brag that he kept up the drag
By the force of an old grass rope.
And when they sent him out to relief
Old Larry went out on a lope.
Chorus

3
In winter time when the hills were clad with snow
O'er the ranges he did go    
With his [his] buffalo coat buttoned up to his throat, (??)
All dangers he did [are] dare
And while the boys were branding the calves
Old Larry would mark their ears
Chorus
