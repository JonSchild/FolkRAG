Rumors may take the form of a local reference, a national reference or an international reference. For the present, we will not let this aspect of rumor content be used to define and characterize that aspect of people's conversation which we shall study. Rumors may be possible [?] or favorable, pessimistic or optimistic. From our point of view, any reference to the war directly or indirectly is to be considered within the scope of this study. By any reference of the war, we include any reference to the antecedents of the war, the military front, the civilian front, international relations, the economic front , moral and propaganda on the psychological front, war aims, results, and any other comments that seem to have relevance. To summarize , for our purposes, a rumor may be conceived of as that aspect of spontaneous comment transmitted orally, presented as fact based on implied private sources which may have a specific of general reference and be favorable as well as hostile in tone. To study a rumor properly , it is important that the rumor be reported in the precise form in which it was originally stated.
