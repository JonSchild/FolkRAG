Dear Miss Prink:
I am mailing back today the final sheet of proof for the
Lomax book of Cowboy songs. I was in New York on Friday and
Saturday, and on Saturday morning I stopped at your office to
deliver it in person. Unfortunately for me your place was
closed, and I could find no facilities for mailing it in New
York.
The melodies of the book now seem to be in very good shape. 
It might be wise for you to inquire into the present condition
of the text. I can only repeat that there must be absolute 
agreement between the words on the text pages and the words as
they appear under the music.
I hope to have, sometime in the future, the pleasure of
visiting the Macmillan Company.
Sincerely yours,
ENW
mr
