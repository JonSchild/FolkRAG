4003 B2 Lucious Curtis
                & Willie Ford        Natchez, Miss.

"Like I foretold you, I ain't 
much of a player".
When Lucious Curtis was there,
Willie "followed after" him,
but he did it skillfully, watching 
the leader carefully.

4002 Lucious Curtis
has made some commercial 
records and would not give me
his "Crushing Blacksnake Blues" 
having been "gypped" by a "feller"
once who stole one of his tunes.
He has played with the Chapman
brothers, one of whom has also
made records under the name
Bo Carter.

4003 B2 - Santa "Field" Blues - 
the accompaniment imitates
carwheels
A stanza runs:
If I had me a heaven of my own
you brown-skinned women'd
be settin' all 'round my throne.
