arr.-Lobatshow THE HARVEST - Tenor trans.-Tyler

The fields are flood-ed with the tears of 
The fields to-day are strewn with thorns the

mutt'-ring men who slave and moan; But now the day of reck'ning
sighs of men have hith-er blown; " " " " " " "

ne-ars when man shall reap what man has sown. When
da-wns " " " " " " " " "

man shall reap what man has sown. Car--ry far,
" " " " " " " CHOR:

song of ours 'round the world 'round

Car---ry far, call to fight, to fight. 

Wake for the reap--ing the day is 

here the day is here for har-vest when man shall 

reap what man has sown When man shall reap wh-at man has sown.
