Monday that her son, Pvt.
Warren P. Horner, who was serving
with a coast artillery unit
when the Philippines fell, has been
cited for gallantry and awarded

Horner was cited occurred during
the bombing of Fort Mills.
     "A bomb struck and demolished
a shelter, killing 31 persons," the
citation sets out. "Private Horner
left a place of shelter and proceeded
to secure aid. While on
his way, a bomb struck so close
to him that he was thrown to
the ground. However, he continued
and delivered the message, bringing
aid to extricate the men from
the demolished shelter."
