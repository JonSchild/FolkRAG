HAVERFORD COURT 
Hotel
HAVERFORD, PA.

June 3, 1941

Dear Miss Rogers:
1. I hate to bother a person
so busy. You wont
believe me, I know, but I
speak soberly and finally.

2. Please hand the enclosure
to Mr. Spivocke.

3. For one week send any
mail coming to me, Miss
Terrill or Mrs. C.C. (Shirley)
Marsell to Earle Hotel, Washington
Square, New York.

Yours humbly,
John A. Lomax
