BJ TAPE 16, p. 75

BJ:    Because I wasn't payin' attention to that; I was workin'.
You see?  Sang my own song, too, another thing.
TL:    Everybody sings their own song?
BJ:    I mean, I would, ya know?  An' I reckon everybody would sing
what they want.  Some of 'em git together an' sing sumpin'.  Sing
church songs; an' [they don't] them (that) wanna sing reels, sing reels (blues).
TL:    Do you think because there were so many different kind of
people there that they didn't sing together?
BJ:    Well, lot of 'em sing together.  Those that, ah, jus' like
if you know a song that diffrunt ones would sing, if you wanna
join wit' 'em, why, you join wit' 'em.

[*(THE "BARBALIANS")*]
TL:    What did you think of the songs from the people, the
Barbarians?
BJ:    The Barbalians, now, who, who know what they said?  Ah, I
didn't. . .
TL:    Nobody knows what they sing?
BJ:    Nobody knows but them.  I ha -- I didn't try to learn.
TL:    Did you people ever try to figure out what they said?
BJ:    No, no.  Not me.  I never did.  Jus' like, jus' like I
don't try to figure out on the records.  I knew wha -- I'd have
a time; it'd take all my life tryin' to know what they say;
I [didn't] wouldn't know what they were sayin'.  An' jus' go on 'bout my
business, 'cause they jus' jabberin'.  So let 'em jabber on.
I, hah, hah, I didn't know what they were sayin'.  But they have
a good time, jus' like anybody.
TL:    Did anybody make friends with they?
BJ:    Oh, ye-ah!  They was much friends.
TL:    Did those people learn how to talk like that?
BJ:    Huh-uh.  I never heard none of 'em try to.  But they talked 
like us.
