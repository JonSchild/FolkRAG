Chorus:
1) Who would nae fecht for Charlie,
Who would nae draw the sword?
Who would nae up and rally
At the Royal Prince's word.
2) Think on Scotia's ancenit heroes
Think on foreign foes repelled.
Think on glorious Bruce and Wallace 
Wha the                        quelled.
3) Rouse, rouse, ye kilted warriors,
Rose, ye heroes of the North.
Rouse and join your chieftan's banners
'Tis your prince that leads you forth.
3) Shall we basely crouch to tyrants?
Shall we own a foreign sway?
Shall a royal Stuart be banish4d
While a stranger rules the day?
4)           lads and lads of honor
Listen rogues and rebels all,
When we come within their border
We may gather Campbell's claw.
5) See the northern clans advancing,
See Glen Gary and Loch Euil,
See the brandishedbroadswords glancing,
Hieland harts as  true as steel.
6) Now our prince has raised his banner,
Now triumphant in his cause,
Now the Scottish lion rallies,
Let us strike for Prince and Laws.

Here's the Gille Callum which is the sword dance. It's a very
old tune indeed - it's supposed to be about a thousand years
old; and it's believed to have been composed sometime after the
accession of King Malcolm Clanmore, the same Malcolm that appears
in Shakespeare's  McBeath. . . .
(He then sings mouth music). . .
