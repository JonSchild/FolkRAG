What happened is really in, incredible.
The, the big companies came and bought the
land for a song - the mountaineers didn't know
of - what was under the land.  They bought the
mineral rights, and ah, maybe for 50 cents or
$2 an acre, these people were poor as a result
of the war and ah, when they woke up they
didn't have ah the rights to the land they were
farming.  And the second thing is that ah they
offered jobs in the coalmines, to the miners.
They went into the mines, they turned out to be
tremendous miners.  They were very valorous,
they faced this incredible conditions of
danger and, and no safety regulations.  Ah
songs, ah, - the first song I recorded in the
mountains was an old blindman in Harlen, and
singing, ah:  [SINGS]
16.21.09.00
16.21.41.00
And this song is about thousands of people
killed and maimed and injured in these early
days when ah, when mining was ah - when the
miners were desperately working for their
pittance of labour, ah, had to put the props
in on their own time, had to clear the rock
away from the, from the coal on their own time,
