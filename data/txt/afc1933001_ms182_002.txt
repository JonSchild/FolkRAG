Dear Mr. Lomax;
    After a series of letters and telegrams I learn, to my horror, that the American Library Association has no money[b] this year with which to pay the expenses of the speakers. They assumed, I think, that The Library of Congress would pay yours.
    It is maddening, because there has never been a time in our history when the values of our own stories an music has seemed so important. We librarians l/ong to further the go/od hings, and we are in a p/osition to. And then a small sum - just a few dollars - prevents us from hearing an expert on values! I would gladly pay your expenses myself. But if would not be considered "p/rofessional conduct""
    We will just have to let it go, I am afraid. Perhaps The New York Public Library can scrape together the dollars to have you come to us next Fall[l].
                                 always sincerely yours
                                              Mary Gould Davis
