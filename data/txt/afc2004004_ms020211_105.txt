Dear Dr. Kaplan: 

I am on my way our of town by plane.  Strongly
recommend you bring the Sea Island Singers,
who are the finest representatives of old
music in the South.  If you can't bring all
five, bring John Davis, Peter Davis and
Bessie Jones.  If only two, bring John Davis
and Bessie Jones.  It's damn hard to choose
between the two!

Yours,

Alan Lomax
