                     " The conduct of officers at Hill Field (Ogden) is scandalous. They are having sex relations with female employees right on the field. Isn't [*1*] that against army regulations? Conditions in El Paso, Texas, where I call, are also terrible. I was told that nearly every young girl in the city is pregnant with some soldier the prospective father of an illegitimate child. There was plenty evidence of it on the streets of El Paso." (Machinery salesman who covers eight western states, calls on military establishments)

               "One of the professors at the University is making $12 a day as a carpenter this summer on one of the Government projects. With the shrinkage of students in his department, I expect to see him take a leave of absence and keep right on working." (Senior student at University of Utah)

              "When they stop giving tires, or even retreads, to railroad men, I guess the rubber situation is getting pretty bad, but the public won't realize it until they take a few hundred of these army 'pleasure cars'. I mean jeeps, off the streets." (Train dispatcher)
