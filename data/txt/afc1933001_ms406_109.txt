Once I asked the Reverend Aaron
Pinnacle of Heavens Gate Church,
South Carolina, why he deliberately
attempted [to in] in his sermons
to influence his congregation
to "shout". In the physical ecstasy
his sermons provoked I had
seen young girls dive through
the air and fall headlong on the
hard floor in defiance of bruised
flesh and broken bones. The
men were more careful
of bodily injuries, seemingly
content to "hold" the [most]
riotness females [inflamed by] temporarily under the influence 
of the words of the minister.
