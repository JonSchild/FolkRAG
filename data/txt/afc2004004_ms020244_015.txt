Reel of 9/26/61, Song 23, Side 2

WALK IN THE LIGHT  A spiritual

Walk in the light,
It's a beautiful light, 
Come where the dewdrops of mercy so bright
Shine all around us
By day and by night.
Oh, Jesus, the light of the world.

I'm gonna walk in the light, etc.

If you walk in the light, etc.

Help me to walk in the light, etc.

Oh, walk in the light, etc.
