Dear Dr. Botkin:

I have been trying to locate a copy of your book, 
"The American Play Party Song" published by the University of 
Nevada. Every source I have tried, including the University
itself, tells me that the book is unavailable. Do you have 
any ideas on where it could be bought? -- we need it rather
badly for office use. 

Best wishes,
Bess Lomax
Music Division
