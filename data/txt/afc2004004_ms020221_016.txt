BJ TAPE 7B, p. 14

And somethin' come jus' as plain as anything all in my whole
mind. Jes' "Bow!" Look[in'] like it speakin' to my soul. Said, "What
is you doin'? What is you doin'?" See? "When the Lawd come to
call them peoples, He's not gonna ask a word about th-- you."
See? "He gonna call you. What is you doin'?" It got so [, that] 'till it look
like somethin' was around me. Somethin' was scarin' me. You
know what I mean? Felt curious, fearful. Well, it's nothin'.
I seed nothin'. "Well, what is you doing?" "Ain' doin' nothin'
with yourself," see? "Nothin'."
Then I got so, in, you know, a funny feelin'. Then I considered
all the way through there; What is I'm doin'? If I 
do sumpin', [then] an' that might he'p somebody else. Then I began to 
start in seekin' the Lawd. If I do sumpin', then all kinds a
things come up against me. You know, you know, peoples, one
thing or other.
But I got so far in it. An' then the Lord meant for me to
go to it. I jus' talked to Him. 'Cause that's the main thing.
Although peoples helps ya. When ya talkin' to them, they help ya,
ya know? An' that, an' that, that really knows. I found mo' good
peoples than I thought was there, see? Satan didn't
let me find 'em. See what I mean?
And ah, then, ah, began to ah, jus' keep on prayin' an'
talkin' to myself an' prayin' to myself, an' always kep' my
Bible. You know, always, oh yeah, I kep' m'Bible with me
alright enough. Yessuh!
An' ah so, I began by read an' read. An' then I'd workin'
an' I'd listen. The peoples an' so...as this kep' on I continue
prayin'. I guess this went on about a week. An' then
I started seekin' outly. Prayin'. I went to the church, ya see.
