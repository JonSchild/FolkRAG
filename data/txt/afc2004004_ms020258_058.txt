WILLIAM TRIMBLETOE

A play of the slave children from Dawson, Georgia

William, William Trimbletoe,
He a good fishman to catch them hands,
Put 'em in the pen,
Some lays eggs an' some don't,
Wire, briar, limber lock,
Set an' sing 'till twelve o'clock,
The clock fell down,
The mice run around,
Y-O-U-T spells out,
To old man Chatman's house.

I went down town the other day,
I met my brother Jim,
He had a hammer, he had a nail,
He had a cat with thirty-nine tails,
Some to the east an' some to the west,
Some to the ever goo-goo nest.

     Children make a circle, pointing their fingers toward the center.
They sing whole song, and the one whose finger comes out on the last
word of song goes to the corner.  Whispering in the circle, the
children choose a counter for the group and pick the name of any
object for everybody in the circle and also choose a name of someone
who is not there.  Then the counter says, "When you coming home?"
The one in the corner replies, "Tomorrow afternoon."  The counter:
"What you gonna bring?"  The corner:  "A dish and a spoon (and a 
fat racoon)."  The counter:  "What you gonna ride on?"  and he says
all the names of the children in the circle plus the extra one.
The corner player has one guess.  If he says the extra name, he
tiptoes back to the circle and counts again.  If he calls the name
of a person in the circle, that person goes to the corner and returns
to the circle with his hand on the back of the corner player.  The
counter then askes:  "What have you got there?"  The chosen player:
"Bag of nibs."  The counter: "Shake 'em 'till they spit."
"What you rather lay on?  Thorn bed or feather bed?"  The chosen
player makes a choice.  If he chooses a thorn bed, he is let down
easy.  If he chooses a feather bed he is let down hard.  Then
anyone may count again.
