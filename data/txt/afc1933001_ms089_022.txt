my club. (Art-History Club)
I know that a personal
note from you will add
much to my program--
in interest--and although
it is a busy season of year,
may I ask this favor of you?
Also, I heard the radio
broadcasts on Columbia
School of Air programs, 2 yrs ago
with Mr. Alan Lomax'
narrations--and became
so interested in folk song
music--that I chose it
for my topic in the art
group of this club.
Would you please 
tell me if those

programs are the ones
you have recently
made into the 5 16 inch
records to be used
for Radio transcriptions.
I refer to the article on
page 61--of News Week
magazine June 8--1941.
I wish to speak of this
in my discourse which
is to be January 5--1942.
I realize that time is
short--but I assure
you that I,--as well as
the entire club, would
greatly appreciate
