Dear Dr. Spivacke:

Below are listed specifications and prices of
recording equipment discussed with you recently in Washington:-

SoundScriber University type recording machine ------ $450.00

folder, together with Bursh soubd cell microphone, weight and
diamond cutting stylus for aluminum. Total weight approx. 115 lbs.
Twelve inch turntable, 78 rpm speed only.

SoundScriber Professional type recprding machine ---- $500.00
Identical with University type except for 16" turntable and
two speeds of 78 and 33 rpm.

oil damped head, any impedance   ---------- $215.00
weight (no power pack required) 55 lbs.)
SoundScriber University Type recording truntable only
-------- $165.00

The SoundScriber Junior is priced at $285.00
complete with Astatic duo-diaphragm microphone. The mechanical
features are practically identical with the University type
but a ten inch speaker, an Audak cutting head, and a lower
powered amplifier are used. The SoundScriber oil damped head
can be supplied with it for $20 additional.

We discussed the setup for a complete rerecording
equipment to provide rerecorded copies of aluminum, acetate, or
cylinders. The copies could, if desired be made on special size
acetate discs for processing and making pressings therefrom.
We would recommend a double turntable unit so as to be able to
copy from one to the other, or to provide simultaneously two
copies from one playing of a wax cylinder. Wax cylinder machines
of the old Edison type and the Dictaphone present day type would
be necessary equipped with the special electric pickup we developed
for minimum wear. Sapphire stylii should be supplied for all
