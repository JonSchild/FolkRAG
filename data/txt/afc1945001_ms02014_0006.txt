Rm. 873, 1355 Market Street,
San Francisco, California.

October 15, 1942.

Personal and confidential

Mr. William H. Webber,
Office of War Information,
1400 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Webber:

This is in reply to your mimeographed
"Personal and Confidential" memorandum of October 3, 1942 ––
Subject: "Availability of Rumor Collectors for Future Studies."

Dentist: Mr. George M. Peters, 1095 Market
Street, San Francisco. Mr. Peters was quite anxious to assist
and I am sure would gladly cooperate in the future. He heard so
few in his dental office that he made a special effort to "hear
more" when he was at the YMCA and at his home. He is a young man
and has a practice that is too big for him to handle.

Drug Store owner: Mr. Edwin H. Nohrden, 400
University Street, Palo Alto, California, Mr. Norden was quite
anxious to cooperate. He is middle aged, steady and of a serious
type. He made a real effort to "record" rumors during the period
requested, but heard none. He would undoubtedly cooperate whenever
you call upon him.

Policeman: Mr. P. A. Andersen, 766 Sutter 
Street, San Francisco. Quite willing to assist but not sure how
much value he will be generally. However, he would be worth
keeping in contact with.

Labor Official: Charles Raudebaugh. Will be
in the Army by the time this reaches you. One of the finest
sources of information this office has had. It is unfortunate
that he will no longer be available.

Chamber of Commerce: Mr. Carroll Snyker,
Chamber of Commerce, 333 Pine Street, San Francisco. Good man ––
willing to cooperate and should be of value in the future.
