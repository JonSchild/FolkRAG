BJ TAPE 7B, p. 20

on the bench, I couldn't go farther. You know, the seat [that] go
out the aisleway, that, like that, ya know, goin' down there. I
got in that first seat. An' I sot right there. 
Right there's where I got saved at. Right there, then I,
then I quit sayin' "Jesus" an' went to sayin' "Glory." See,
an' it's comin' up, boy, oh my! An' I was so hoa'se that I jes'
above a whisper it, "Yeah, ah, ah..." Jus', that's, that's jes',
jes' could go, 'cause you done been seekinâ€™ so hard.
An' when the Lawd blessed me, I come out from there an' I
was fer singin'...I was shoutin'...I was walkin' down them aisleway
an' let me tell ya, I woke up the peoples of the neighborhood.
As hoa'se as I was, I woke 'em up. God jus' let -- An'
the peoples come out there in they pajamas an' they gowns
an' things wropped around 'em. It was befo' day in the mornin'.
Some of 'em left that church an' went on from there an' put
they clo'es on an' went out in the field[s]. It's jus' about day.
An' I'm tellin' you, hit was all night. Tol' 'em I'd rassle,
but I rassled, all night, let me tell ya. I had a time with it.
Devil didn' wanna turn me loose. 
So I come out -- When I caught myself I was singin' this
song about: 
I come outa sin an' shame, 
Ain't that the good news! 
I done come outa sin an' shame, 
Ain't that good news!
On my way to Heaven an' I ain't gonna stop, 
Ain't gonna be no stumblin' block, 
Ain't that good news, great Lawd, EVERYBODY...
