Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax,

I am sending you a collection of
authentic Chain Gang songs, recorded
by Joshua White, which I think may
have enough merit to be included in
your permanent collection of American
folk music.

I would be delighted to hear from you
concerning your reaction to these songs.

You may remember meeting me some months
ago at Columbia Recording.

Sincerely yours,
COLUMBIA RECORDING CORPORATION
