My dear Mr. Lomax:
I have just read your story from the International News Service in the New Orleans Times- Picayune with the caption "Music of Cajuns Termed Untapped State Resource."
Your article overlooks the fact that in the Department of Romance Languages of the Louisiana State University a very definite effort has been made to collect the folk songs of the Creoles and Acadians. You probably are familiar with Miss Whitfield's thesis. We have, in addition, purchased a recording machine to collect the music of these songs.
In your future articles, I would be grateful if you would give us credit for not completely overlooking the "Resources of the State".
Yours Truly,
Jas. F. Broussard
