[Will, I] wimmins all heard that poor Brady
was dead
[And] go back home a on they dresses
in red
Come slippin' & slidin' up & down the 
street.
In their big mother hubbards an' 
their stockin' feet.

repeat 1st verse

cloudy lookin, just like rain
John Henry said to his captain,
boys,
"Well a man ain' nothin but a man
Lawd lawd
"  "  "  "  "  "  "

[When] John Henry he was a lil baby
You could hol' him in the hollow of yo' 
han'd,
Las' word I heard John Henry's father 
say,
John Henry gonna be a steel drivin' man.
Lawd (2)
