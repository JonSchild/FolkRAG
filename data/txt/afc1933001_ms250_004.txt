Dear Alan: It's a damn shame that
you can't authorize me to go
to Alpine to see Sloan Matthews.
See one paragraph in the enclosed
copy of his letter to me. I'll use
my nearly worn out tires
to see him if you will get
me explicit authority to make
the trip under the usual allowance. 
I have no money of
my own to spend.

Pat is better from a serious
illness. Shirley is nursing Chris
in Mobile. Johnny is cleaning up
his business for enlistment in some
branch. From Bess I hear nothing
at long intervals.
Father.
