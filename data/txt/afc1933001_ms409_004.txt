My Dear Sir:
For several years I have been endeavoring to make a complete collection of the native ballads and songs of the west, particularly those known as Cowboy Songs. Many of these songs have never been in print, but, like the Masonic Ritual, are transmitted from one generation to another by "word of mouth." They deal mainly with former episodes; the deeds of desperadoes; the life of the ranger; the experiences of cowboys; the trials of the Forty-niners, buffalo hunters, stage divers, and freighters;â€”in short, they are attempts to portray, in poetry and in song, the romantic life of the pioneers who peopled the vast region west of the Mississippi river.
