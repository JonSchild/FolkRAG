[As we ride along he often sings. The other day his song was
an appeal to Old Hannah (the sun) to go down.

"About three o'clock on a hot summer day de sun for-
gits to move on down an' stops. Den de mens sing dis song:"]

    It is a far cry from Iron Head back in a Texas penitentiary to the tunes of one of the standard
English ballads. Iron Head's version has never been printed as
[it has been] popularly sung down the centuries, but the tune and the story
in every important detail follows the tale as it was sung [around] within
castle walls when men rode to war clad in armour with their la-
dy's favor fluttering from [his] the lances. Here is what Iron Head
sang to me:

    Once I knowed old lady,
    Round Tennessee she dwell;
    She had a lovin' husband
    But she loved young men's as well -
[?]
            Love my darlin', oh!
          I love my darlin', oh!

    I'm goin' down by de doctor's shop,
    Jest as straight as I can go,
    See if I can't find some instrument round
                    dat place
    Dat'll run my husband blind -

    Love my darlin', oh!
          I love my darlin', oh!

    She only found two marrow-bones,
    She made him eat them all.
    And he says, "Now my dear wife I'm blind"
    And just can't see at all." -

            Love my darlin', oh!
          I love my darlin', oh!

    Says, "I would go to the river and drown myself,
    Honey, if I only knew the way."
    She says, "No, my dear, come and go with me,
    Mother 'fraid you'll run astray" -

            Love my darlin', oh!
          I love my darlin', oh!

She only found two narrow-bones,
She made him eat them all 
And he says, "Now my dear wife I'm blind
And just can't see at all 

          Love my darlin', oh!
         I love my darlin', oh!

Says, "I would go to the river and drown myself, 
Honey, if I only knew the way."
She says, "No, my dear, come and go with me,
Mother fraid you'll run astray"- 

           Love my darlin', oh!
          I love my darlin', oh!
