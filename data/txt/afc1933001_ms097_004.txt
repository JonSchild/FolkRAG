your concern about him. 
He is much better, - even 
gets out into his garden 
nearly every day now, - 
though the doctor advises 
that he should confine 
himself mainly to an 
intellectual interest.
Mr. Lomax has done a 
little work at his desk, 
too, but tires quickly.
Spring has at last 
fairly plumped itself down 
in our midst, and our redbud,
tulips, bridal wreath, pansies, 
columbines, are blooming.
Here are best wishes 
for you and your family. 
When the records, as well
as the report, reach you, 
will you please inform 
Mr. Spivacke ?
Yours very truly,
Ruby Terrill Lomax.
Did we thank you 
for the groups of records that came to us?
We do thank you. We've enjoyed 
them.
