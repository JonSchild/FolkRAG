It's in your blood - you're
brot up to it from a nipper
Qu & Ma is the mainstay of
the island -
Too [heatby?] on this island -
got to us
They're the first ones to handle
the stone - laid down by
nature 8,000,000 yrs ago -

Didn't have enough sense

Used to work in fam gangs in
the old days -
Outsiders never cd get in -
You was lined up from the day
you were born to start in
the quarry
