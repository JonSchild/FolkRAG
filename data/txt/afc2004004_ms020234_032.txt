         But after all, the point is:  This boy was in this ah, in
this ah, place, feedin' the hawgs, an' had to eat with the hawgs an'
he come into hisself.  By hisself.  So that's what I always have
did:  I come to myself by myself.  Ya see?  An' you can come to
the natchul self; without you come to yourself, you never, never
can do anything.  Ya know, with anything.  What I mean by that,
make up your mind within yourself.  An' stick to it; don't care
what nobody else say or do.  Just stick to it.  If it's the right
mind.  An' go in an', and then, go on.  They may say this-that-or-the-other,
but before you jus' drop dead somewhere or nother, you
out there jus' like, jus' say I'm off up here now.  An' ah, I could
jus' fall away an' ain't got nothin'[.] an' nobody will let me in
or out.  Well, I know I got plen'y -- I will say plen'y -- of
peoples that will come to my rescue, you know?  An' ah, though,
if I have to be at the, at the, as the prodigal son told his
father, if I have to be their hired servant, they will help me.
Ya see?

         An' so, I could, an', an', if I git hard-hearted an' jus'
rebellious-minded, "I ain't gonna let them know nothin'; I ain't
gonna do it.  I jus' laugh [with] at 'em; I ain't gonna do nothin'."
Jus' drop away. (dead?)  Somebody fin' me somewhere around the house where
I did it. (??)  That don't; that's no sense to it.  See?  You jus',
you jus' throwed your own self away; your own mind.  'Cause it's
sure gonna come to ya; [conscious] conscience gonna come to ya.  'Cause they
two things that's gonna folla ya all your life.  That's old age
an' conscience.  Old age and conscience will always folla ya.
The folks say , "I ain't never thought about doin' this-that-an-the-other right."  
You have thought of it.  Ya hear folks say,
