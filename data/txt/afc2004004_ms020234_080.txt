     Ya see me comin' to the lot. . .I be goin' walk to the lot sometimes,
look at 'em.  They buck their ears this way an' that way
an' look at. . .Well, I don't know what he sayin' now?  You know,
I could see, "I'll kick her when she git here," or sumpin' like
that.  I don't know what he's sayin'.  I got scared of 'em.
     An' if they kill ya, ya cain't do a thing about it.  Ya see?
That's what I don't like about a mule an' a hoss.  They can kill
you an' you can't. . .
TL:  How do they kill you?
BJ:  Well, they have a wreck wich ya, you know, throw ya?  Sure,
mule, mules kilt many people.  They stomp 'em an' all like that.
That's, that's th' way they kill ya.  They kick the devil out you.
An' they, an' they kill you, well, what you -- all you do then is
clip 'is ear.  You know how they clip they ears; see a little clip
in they ear.  He's a murderer.
TL:  Is that right?
BJ:  Yeah, sure.  That's the way they let you know a hoss or a
mule is a murderer, they clip his ear.  Ya see that lil' clip in
one's ear.  Sometime ya see two.
TL:  You mean they cut. . .?
BJ:  They clip a little place out it, out the whole meat.  Jus'
clip a lil' place out the end, up in the top a the ear.  You
watch 'em.  You see one clipped in 'is ear he's a murderer!
That let you know he's dangerous.
TL:  Yeah, he killed a man, huh?
BJ:  He killed a man or a woman, one, whatever he kilt.  An'
deh, s-- I seen one clipped on each side.  'Cause they had a mule
named Scott.  Got a man an' a woman, _______.  See, the right
ear's a man an' the lef' ear's a woman.  An' ol' Scott had two of
'em.  Had one on each ear.  Some dead (?).  An' some time, brother,
