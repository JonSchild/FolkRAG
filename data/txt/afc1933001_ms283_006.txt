[Whiskey drinking.... Men had to have something to wash the 
new country out of their stomachs... The Finn.... Northern Michigan... 
Do your whiskey drinking vicariously with me....
Rye Whiskey....]
How did cowboys sing... [Vicariously?] Sang like coyotes, 
sat around in a circle and lifted their heads, only one at 
a time instead of all together.... Their ballads were generally 
long and sad and had the melancholy of the plains and the long 
days in the sun and dust in them.... Newsprint quality of the 
ballads... factual... unsentimental.... tough and hardminded... 
Buffalo Skinners.... CCCCCCC
Bad men. Bad men. Now the people loved bad men in the old country 
Robin Hood, Dick Turpin, Captain Kidd, Lord Thomas, The Boston 
Burglar -- because [it] these were the people who broke away from 
the monotony of the feudal life and pushed the aristocrats around... 
But when they got to this country everybody turned into a potential 
bad man. No more dra ing and quartering and the fighting was 
practically continuous.....By heaven nobody was even going to think 
they would impose on these fighting Yankee woddsmen and the reb boys 
and get away with it. Fight as soon as they'd look 
at you....
