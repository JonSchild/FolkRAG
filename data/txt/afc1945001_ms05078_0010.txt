The Army plans to put women in the ordnance factories and the
holding and reconsignment point in such isolated or desert
towns as Hermiston, Oregon, Pasco, Washington, and Yermo and 
Sierra Ordnance Depot, California, because it will be impossible
to get civilian women to go to those places at civil service wages.
This is the only way the Army feels it can staff such establishments.
