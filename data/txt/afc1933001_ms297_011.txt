New Folklore Bulletin Published
First Time; Devoted to Folktales

  The first issue of the Hoosier
Folklore Bulletin was published at
Indiana University this week by the
Hoosier Folklore Society, with Dr.
Herbert Halpert of the I. U. English
department, president of the
Society, as editor.

  Devoted to the folktales of the
English-speaking white population,
this first issue of the bulletin contains
tales reported for the first
time from America, although they
are told over large parts of Europe.
All of the tales were collected in
Indiana.

  Officers of the association feel
that since the founding of the society
in 1937 there has been an increasing
state-wide interest in folklore
and the bulletin hopes to show
what is available in the state, and
to guide further efforts in collecting.

   Dr. Halpert said that it is planned
to have future numbers of the
bulletin devoted to various other
aspects fo Indiana folklore - songs,
games, children's rhymes, beliefs,
play-party songs, witch tales, place-name
stories and local legends.

"We will not confine ourselves
only to the English-speaking tradition
represented by those whose
folks came into the state across
from Massachusetts and New York,
or up from North Carolina and
Kentucky," Dr. Halpert said.

"In addition we hope to represent
the early folklore strata of the
French at Vincennes, and the older
German and Swiss settlements at
such places as Oldenburg and Vevay;
and the more recent, and often
more active, folk tradition of
the Serbians at Blanford, and the
many groups in our northern industrial
area.  There is also an unexplored
wealth of Negro folklore
in Indiana which needs to be investigated."
