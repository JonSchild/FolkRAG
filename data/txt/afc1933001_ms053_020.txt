more collecting work. Maybe
though your silence has only
touched my vanity as perhaps
you grow weary with
Lomaxes. Seriously, though, I
am living near an almost
entirely unexplored field. The
Rio Grande River from Brownsville
to El Paso would surely yield
some valuable finds, as would
the Southern borders of New Mexico,
Arizona and California.
But I'm quite willing to go where
you say, and I hope at least
that you will write me
soon telling me about the
situation and outlook.

Always cordially yours,
John A. Lomax
