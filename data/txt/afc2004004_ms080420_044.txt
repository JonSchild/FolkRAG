Man: That's the way you get carried away with the music.
Women's voices, agreeing.
Man: Real good music can do for you.
AL: How does it make you feel inside? Just shaky or what?
Man: You just blow out.
Woman: You feel like you're really doing something important.
Something that not everyone can do. You may not look like
the best dancer but you feel like you're better.
("You get carried away..") You feel good.
Woman 2: You get rid of your inner tensions.
AL: You know, I've seen you prancing up there and I know
you're feeling something special. What is it now?
Woman: I don't know. I'm just, when I'm up there I'm in
my own little world. Nobody's with me, I'm hearing everyting,
but I'm thinking, what am I going to do next, now. I love it.

AL: What's your favorite dance?
Woman: Just anything, just dancing. But I love to clog.
I belong to a western square dance team, but I love to clog
better than anything.
AL: That gives you the most freedom?
Woman: I feel like I'm myself. There's something that I can
do. What I do is my own thing. Nobody tells me what I have
to do or how I have to do it. I know I have to form with
the team, but I still feel like I can do my own thing. And
