Afternoon with Hamish; he is beautiful
but has one note, Scotland & its
deeple & deeps. He found he was too
tired from last night's bali to
sing. Also Robin, same.
Dinner last night with 
John Portwee, the English Danny
Kaye, in his cellar apartment.
[oak lined] plaster & oak, full of
old grim cracks, exhibitionist, with
an obsequious servant named
Coulter. Portwee looked old &
anxious around the eyes. Phone
rang every 5 minutes with another
woman to be postpoted. Petwee
dramatized each call like a
small boy playing criminal.
God, I'm such a puritan & 
self-important I hated it all
instead of being amused.
