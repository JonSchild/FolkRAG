DOWN HERE (SINNER MAN)

CHORUS: Down here,
Down here,
There is no hidin' place down here.
Well, you run to the rock
To hide your face,
The Rock cry out,
"No hidin' place!"
No hidin' place
Down here.

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Sinner man,
You better run,
Oh sinner man, you better run,
Oh, sinner man,
You better run,
You'll wake up some mornin',
The judgment's come,
There's no hidin' place
Down here.                                  (CHORUS)

Run to the sea,
And the sea cry out,
You run to the mountain
And the mountain cry,
You run to the ocean,
The ocean say, Lord,
"There's no hidin' place
"Down here!"                              (CHORUS)

Gamblin' man,
You better run,
Oh, gamblin' man, you better run,
Oh, gamblin man,
You better run,
You'll wake up some mornin',
Judgment's come
There's no hidin' place
Down here.                                (CHORUS)
