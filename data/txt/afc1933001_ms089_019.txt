    I confess that these factors did not
occur to me in the telephone booth as I was talking to
you, but I believe they outweigh the instinctive reaction
on which I acted on short notice. In any case, I certainly 
intended no discourtesy toward you or toward your
son and intend none now. You know that I have every
reason to feel kindly toward both of you.

    I trust that you and yours will have
a good Christmas.

    Your own,
    Lynn Landrum
