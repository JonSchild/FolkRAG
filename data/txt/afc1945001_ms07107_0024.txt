"This family came down from the north with a negro servant who ate
at the table with them and slept in the house. It got around and
then somebody burned a cross in the yard. The negro servant left
town right away and they packed up and moved a little later." (Woman
office worker, Birmingham, 8/5/42.)  [*1*]
