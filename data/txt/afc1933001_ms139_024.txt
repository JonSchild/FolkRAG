Dear Mr. Lomax;-

Your letter relative to the clipping
"Home On the Range" has been received, and I regret that I can give
you no information concerning the date of it's publication. It
was published two or three years ago but I do not know the month.
Mr. Oscar Fox who composes music for cowboy ballads asked me to
secure a copy for him and I was unable to do so, and neither have
I been able to secure a copy from the local paper in Kansas where
the story was first published. That is the reason I want to get
this story back. It was the only copy I had and I prized it highly.
I sent it to you in good faith and expected to have it returned
at once. Evidently it was not of much value to you or it would not
have been misplaced, so I am expecting it returned.

Very truly yours,
Esther Belle Beachy
(Mrs. J.K.)
