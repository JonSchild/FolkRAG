Dear Fannie:
In the summer of 1959 I visited your county and recorded
a number of blues composed by Fred McDowell, your brother.
You accompanied him on three of those songs, playing a comb.
The song titles are:
1-- SHAKE 'EM ON DOWN
2-- SHAKE 'EM ON DOWN--II
3--I'M GOIN DOWN TO THE RIVER
4-- BLUES
In return for your assistance In this recording session,
and for all permission to sell those recordings to a commercial
company, I am enclosing a check for ten dollars, in full payment
for all rights. Please sign all three copies of this
letter and return two of them to me in the enclosed envelope.
Sign the check on the back and deposit it in the bank.
This will conclude all financial arrangements.
Alan Lomax

ACCEPTED AND AGREED
