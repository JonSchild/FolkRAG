#226 Sacred Harp 

p. 7

(Mr. R): singing the words to a triplet when they on different 
parts of the musical staff, you sing them just like:
"won-der-ful": you take whatever syllable you have, and
you go: "da-da-da" -- "won-der-ful" or "suh-uh-uh"
or any other words with three beats to give it, like 
"won-der-ful."

Man: How does that (unintelligible)..in the measure?
...we say it like two quarter notes instead of three...

Mr. R: When you put a figure 2, those three 1/4 notes would
answer to fillin' up that measure, but you just sing 'em
a little faster.

Man: (Unintelligible)

Mr. R: 31 on top, here you got the 93rd psalm. It's in 3/2
time, you got a whole note, which gets two beats, and 
then you got 3 quarters, which gets one beat. In the 
tenor, on 31, on top -- so you got two beats here, goin'
down the accented part, then you got one beat goin' up.
He sings: "Sol La Fa ...La mi fa sol : won-der-ful..."
The words: "the-uh-uh"...you start your words just like
you would a tie. We only have just a few triplets in
our book. A chromatic is where a sharp or flat is
placed before a note in the song, not at the beginning.
Those are signature flats and sharps. but the chromatics
here raise the tone a half step, or lower the tone a 
half step. Or if it's natural, it cancels out whatever
it is, restores it to its natural level.
