3.  Avoid printing rumors which can be denied only in part,
     in partial detail, or in hedging language.
4.  Rumors are colorful and interesting. Rumor denials
     should be equally interesting. Some rumor columns fail
     in their task because the rumors printed are sensational,
     whereas the denials are dull.
5. The catchy or "slogan" parts of a rumor should not be printed; 
     it is essential to "break up" the catchy, quotable part 
     of any rumor. The denial of the rumor will not scotch the
     catchy or slogan part of the rumor, which may win popularity 
     (detached from the rumor), because it is highly quot-
     able.
6.  It is never advisable to print rumors which are phrased as
     epigrams, limericks, "gags", puns, etc. The content may be
     denied, but the phrasing may catch on.
7.  Complicated arguments or cumbersome language are undesirable
     in denying rumors. A rumor gains its impact by being short,
     dramatic, and pointed. A rambling or complex denial fails
     to nail the rumor on the head and tends to give greater
     credibility and circulation to the rumor.
8.  In denying rumors, it is effective to use decisive words
     ("false", "absolutely false", "nonsense") at the beginning
     of the denial. Beginning the denial with qualified phrases
     or an apologetic attitude gives the rumor an aura of truth.
     It has been found dangerous to start the denial with such
     phrases as, "It is true that....", "We must admit that....",
     or "There is some truth in the statement that.....".
9.  If a rumor is printed and is not denied flatly, then the rumor 
      has been given a wider public and increased circulation;
      the controversial aspects of the rumor, or the problem to
      which the rumor refers, may be kept alive.
10. Research shows that it is best to use the same face-type of
      the same point for both the rumor and the denial of the rumor.
      Tests show that where rumors (or rumor-denials) are
      printed in bold-face, italics, or special face-type, readers
      fall into the habit of reading all the rumors and few (or
      none of the denials.
11. It is effective to identify the rumor prominently as RUMOR
      (or PHONY) and the rumor-denial as FACTS or TRUTH. It is
      unwise to identify the rumor-denial as "'ANSWER": this gives
      the impression that rumors contain enough truth to warrant
      an "answer".
12. Some rumors are "double-barreled". i.e. they contain false
       interpretation and a false fact, or they contain three or
       four false facts or allegations. Such rumors require long,
       involved answers; it is best to break them up into [*separate*] short 
       rumors which can be denied effectively.
13. If long rumors are printed, they should be denied in full.
       To deny only one part of a rumor permits other parts to go
       unchallenged.
