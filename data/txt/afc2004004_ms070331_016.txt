Down in the valley, the valley so low,
Hang your head over - hear the wind blow.
Hear the wind blow dear, hear the wind blow.
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow.

Roses love sunshine, violets love dew.
Angles in heaven, know I love you.
Know I love you dear, know I love you,
Angels in heaven, know I love  you.

Build me a castle, forty feet high,
So I may see him as he rides by.
As he rides by dear, as he rides by,
So I may see him, as he rides by.

(Repeat) Down in the valley, etc.

A cannibal king, with a big nose ring,
Fell in love with a dusky maid.
And every night by the pale moonlight
Across the canal he'd wade.
He'd hug and kiss this dusky miss
In the shade of the bamboo tree,
And every night by the pale moonlight
It sounded like this to me.
Ah-oomph, (smack-smack) Ah-oomph, (smack-smack)
Ah-oomph, ta-ra-ra-ra!
Ah-oomph, (smack-smack) Ah-oomph, (smack-smack)
Ah-oomph, ta-ra-ra-ra!

Down by the old mill stream, where I first met you,
With your eyes so blue - dressed in gingham too.
It was there I knew, that I loved you true,
You were sixteen - my village queen,
Down by the old mill stream.

Sweetly sings the donkey,
As he goes to hay,
If you do not feed him,
You will hear him bray,
Hee-haw, hee-haw, - hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw!
