Significance of the Condition
   The analysis of Southern income based
on these three independent, authoritative
estimates has necessarily been somewhat
superficial, but has evolved at least one
indisputable fact, namely, that Southern
income with respect to population is about
half that of the rest of the country. the
real significance of the lowness of the 
South's income lies essentially in the fact
that costs of living between the South and
other parts of the country are comparable,
if not virtually equal. Differences in
money income therefore serve largely to
measure similar differences in living
standards. The South's low income is not 
compensated by reduced living costs, and
the region must necessarily enjoy a less
adequate living and experience less economic
well-being. This condition is reflected 
in poor health conditions and facilities, 
the dire need of re-housing for 
millions of Southern families, little purchasing 
power, the lack of necessary food
and clothing, inadequate credit facilities,
and insufficient capital with which to develop
the region's abundant natural resources
and industrial potentialities. The
South is living close to poverty.
   The South has the reputation of being
the part of the country where living costs
are the lowest. The general assumption
is that Southerners need less income to
experience economic well-being. But this
is a popular belief, not a scientific conclusion.
Drs. Wilson Gee and William F. 
Ogburn, in different and independent
studies comparing costs in representative
cities in the South and outside of it, have
both shown that the prevailing impression
that living is cheaper in the South is a 
questionable one. Total subsistence costs
of living to the same standard are much
the same in Southern cities as in those of 
other parts of the nation. Lower incomes
in the South necessitate lower standard
of living, which are usually confused with
lower costs of living. It costs the Southerner
as much to live as the person outside
the South, but he naturally cannot afford 
to spend as much. This fact makes for
a lower standard and less adequacy of
living.
   The data advanced by Drs. gee and 
Ogburn apply only to wage earners in
cities, although it may rather safely be
argued that they apply in much the same
manner to all urban classes. They cannot
with any degree of validity however,
be extended to the rural population. A
study by Dr. E. L. Kirkpatrick, The
Farmer's Standard of Living, on the comparative
cost of living in the various rural 
areas of the United States indicates that
the annual cost of living was less by approximately
$100 in the Southern States
considered than in those of the New England 
and North Central States. On the 
other hand, indication based on the distribution
of the total value of goods used
are that the Southern families considered
in the study enjoyed a somewhat less
adequate living.


   There is no easy, quick way to improve
the South's income level. Just as a combination
and interaction of many complex 
factors have produced over a period of
many decades the present economic and
social plight of the South, so it will be a 
matter of decades before the region can
have hoped to throw off this heritage of
the past, which today means low incomes
and low living standards for millions of
the Southern population. The broad policy
to be followed in the region seems to 
center about a reconstruction and reform
of agriculture, and an increase and sound
guidance of the ever-quickening trend
of industrialization. This embodies also
a balancing of the agricultural and industrial
interests to the end that they mutually
contribute in best expression the


the South, but it must be guided along
sound and intelligent lines. It should be
wisely diversified, sanely decentralized,
and should provide reasonably adequate
wages and living standards. It should be
financed as much as possible with Southern
capital, and the present migration of cheap
industry should be carefully checked and
guided. Organizations or bureaus of research
are needed to survey the industrial
possibilities of the various stages as integral
parts of the region and to chart an 
intelligent program for their sound exploitation. 
A sound development of industry
built on the rising purchasing power
of the farmers and growing out of an 
improved agriculture would be a major
factor in improving the South's income
level.
