     Then I went to travelin' again, all about, with Joe. But
we traveled a while an' come back when it time for Joe to be
bo'n. Hah, ya know, I was wit' Joe then, but I come back, ya
know to -- my younger boy. 'Cause we traveled [around so] also a while
an' -- um, not a while, but that season, ya know. They ain't long
with a season. That's ah. . .
AL: (?)
BJ: Ah, we, we came up to. . . Jus' 'long, 'long with the summer.
You see, this time of year, we'd be gittin' up back home. Um,
befo' this time of the season.
[*(1939-1950) FOLLOWS CROP*]
AL: Do you pick all the way? How far north?
BJ: Well, we pick ah, as fer as we could go. The first year we
went up [there], we, we, we stopped in 'Lizabeth City, North
Carolina. An' in big ah, Newbury, N. C. -- that not far from
'Lizabeth City -- then we come on over to 'Lizabeth City, a
while . . .jus' where the bes', bes' work at, ya know. An' the
man that [be] wa' wich ya, see, he go, he pick the bes' places, ya
know. 'Cause he was a contractor, ya know. An' so we jus' -- hundreds
of us, ya know, plenty of peoples, ya see? An' ah, then we
left there an' come on up to, ah, Bass -- ah, not Bass --
Heightstown, New Jersey. See? Then we worked up there a while.
     So the next year, after Joe got, you know, older, old
enough, however, not, not, not next year. The next year, George
came up by himself. But the next year, I came with him, again.
So from then in on, we traveled.
AL: For how many years did you do that?
