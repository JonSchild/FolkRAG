Tape:  1313 cont.  Octa Clark   4
know if we give  trouble, we gonna get more trouble when we
get back. . . . . . .home.  Lord lord.  Oh yeah, the old people was
rough on the kids.
AL:  A lot of boys went to a jail, I know there were a lot of
songs about going to jail.  Somebody must have been in those
jails to make those songs up.
Octa:  Well, they just figured that it would go in the songs,
something new.  We was five brothers, and everyone get big,
and my daddy told us something, he said if you go wrong, and
you go to jail, you gonna die in the jail, I won't get you out.
We never goed there. . . . . .
AL:  The people were harder though on the women than on the
men, weren't they?  Because they expected those girls to walk
the chalk line and never fool around with any boys.
Octa:  Oh yes, they watched them pretty close.
AL:  The old ladies were watching them.
Octa:  Oh yes, you don't see a girl go out with a boy. . . .
AL:  Cause sometimes those girls would slip, wouldn't they?
Octa:  No, no sirree.  If it it's a dance hall and somebody
notice, they wouldn't let them in.
AL:  If a girl had a bad reputation.
Octa:  Yes, they can't go out to a dance hall and get with a
boy, and the boy be by himself.  If the boy brings his mama,
then it will be all right.
AL:  And they used to have somefights over those women
sometimes, didn't they?
