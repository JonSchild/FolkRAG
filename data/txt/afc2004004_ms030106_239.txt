(In Tacoma one time, Anita drank Worchester sauce and a little whiskey
on top.  Suddenly picked up platter and busted it across JR's head- nobody
could hold her- wanted to get to JR and kill him.  The next day
couldn't remember a thing about it.)When they brought her home, she got hold
of JR's razor.  JR got out of the door- a friend got between and cut his
hand wide-open- brought her to her senses.  JR stayed away in the hotel-
Anita asked why he hadn't knocked her out.
When __________ for Alaska sold out- had diamonds pinned all inside
my underwear.  Before I had left for Alaska had got hooked up in a game
with Nigger Nate, Guy Harte, Chinese Smoke, Linney Boyd, Russell Walton,
Cole Cook, Blacky Williams- game worth a lot of money.  The smallest bet
on the table $110- JR had lot $2200- Bricktop came in and say, "What's
the matter"?  JR asked for money. " I have got $10 and wouldn't loan
this to my mother".  Got $5 and let his bet ride on his money.  Patty
hit 18 straight licks and JR stayed with him, eight straight licks to
$1280.  JR began betting for himself and run it up to $6000.00- began
breaking Jimmy-  JR ended up with $11,000- everybody handed Jimmy money-
started throwing up jewelry- by morning Jimmy had broke everybody in the
whole bunch .  JR had given a pal a couple of thousand to "woke up on".
Pal began buying drinks a dollar a drink and paying off like a slot machine-
got mad and asked for money- returned to crap table to lose every
thing he had- by morning as broke again, 1919.
Left Vancover with Hall and went to Casper, Wyoming to work for
Bill Taylor- a big barn- not much business- 45 degrees below- had loaned
Hall $600 and Jelly has never seen him since.  JR followed him- 1920- first
time I met Andy Kirk, who was playing with a 12 or 14 piece band of George
Morrison- (Andy Kirk is now very prominent).  He was from Newport, Ky.
