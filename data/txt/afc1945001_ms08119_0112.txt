Do I Worry?
I
I've been in a uniform for many months, 
And nothing wrong do I find;
The only worry pressing me, 
Is the folks I left behind.
II                  
The Nazis are fleeing in panic!
Italians are all on the run!
Japs kari-kari all over the place!
They just saw a Yank with a gun!
III
I'm back in the gaurd house again. 
Last night I got into hot water;
I winked and smiled at a girl, 
Who turned out to to the Major's daughter!
