Mr. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

    The machines and appurtenances should be in your hands
by the time this letter reaches you. But please do not leave
Port Aransas until you receive a shipment from Presto. I
ordered discs, cutting needles and playback needles to be
sent you direct. Alan promised to send you instructions
for the use of the machine. (It might be advisable for you
to write to the Presto Recording Co., 242 West 55th Street,
New York City, giving your itinerary and asking them to
furnish you with a list of recommended "service stations."
They have agents all over the country.)

    Thank you for aiding Dornbusch in this White House
party. If successful, it should aid the entire cause of
folk-songs.

    Have a nice trip!

    Sincerely yours,
    Harold Spivacke
    Chief, Division of Music
