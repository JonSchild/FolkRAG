A: Do you know how that went?
S: Yes, I know how some of that went.
A: Sing a little of that.

Frankie and Albert.
Will stark.

Frankie was a good woman,
Everybody knowed.
She paid 81 dollars 
For Albert's suit of clothes.
He's her man,
But he done her wrong.

Frankie went to the ballroom,
Asked for a glass of wine.
She asked for the loving bartender,
"Have you see that man of mine?
He's my man,
But he done me wrong."

The bartender said, "Yes,
Frankie, I ain't gonna
Tell you no lie.
He left here about a hour ago
With the girl called Alice Fly.
He's your man, 
But he done you wrong."

Frankie went on down the street.
She heard a bulldog bark.
Say, "That must be Albert
Hiding in the dark.
He's  my man,
But he done me wrong."
