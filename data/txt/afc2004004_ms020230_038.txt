they ain't had much sense when they started.
TL:    When you used to drink, though, let's say when you drank a lot
and had to go to work the next day, the first thing you'd do
is get up and eat?
BJ:  No-o.  [Why should I get up and. . .?] Wash up, ya know?  If you can eat, you eat.
TL:    If you can eat?
BJ:    Um-hum, um-hum.  'Cause sometimes your system'll be so bad
you ain't, you just don't have no [dish] taste, to eat anything.  But the
best thing. . .
TL:    You don't force yourself to eat?
BJ:    Oh yeah, no, hum-un.  Just drink.  Drink sumpthin', like
coffee or sumpin' like that.  But I was never was a person that,
like I hear a lot of folks say, "I couldn't make it."  That's
why they called me a, a baby while I was drinkin'.  'Cause they
say I wasn't a drinker.  They wanted -- next [one -- ] mornin' they want[ed]
another drink, a [straight one] straightener.  An' I couldn't stand it.  I didn't
wanta see them or neither         !  Hah, I didn' want them
to come about me.  I jus' couldn't, couldn't stand it.  An' so by
that, they know I wasn't a drinker, huh!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!   I
couldn't take another [one] drop.  Hum-um, [couldn't] don't bring it this way.
TL:    What did they used to drink the next morning?
BJ:    Noth-- Anything they can get.  It's [a wonder] some of 'em would
[don't] have a fit, don't git another'n.  An' they would, you know,
[would] just' [--] run an' git sumpin'.  It's [thet] a straighener [liquor]; they call it
[that'll straighten 'em] a straightener but I ain't never [one] wanted to get straightened,
'cause [I] that I had is first crooked me, huh! (?)  I never could
stan' that.  An' so, therefore, they used to make fun a me.  Say,
"Oh, you ain't nothin' but a baby.  You don't know how ta drunk."
