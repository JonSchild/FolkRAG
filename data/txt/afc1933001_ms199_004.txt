New York,
Monday.

Dear Rae,
The trip keeps on being delayed, and I'm beginning to decide
it won't happen. Anyhow, work is going on well with book, thanks
in part to your good help.
Could you send me by return mail the texts to the following
songs published on the Library sets:
The Lowlands of Hollad... 21B2       103B2 < 29
The Iron Merrimac... 29A2
Possum Was an Evil Thing.. L8 A10  37B1
Sea Lion, Woman... 12B7     20
Pool Little Johnny 12B10      20
with a bill. All regards and thanks......
Alan
