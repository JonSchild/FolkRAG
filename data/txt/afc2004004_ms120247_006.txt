shadows across the company. The drums were being tuned, 
cocomacaques descending on the wooden stakes. The company 
laughed and talked in concert. Revolie and I were busy setting 
up the recording machine, the amplifier and turntable on the gallery and 
the microphone hanging upside down over the second drum. I was 
anxious to make good drum records against a 
background of singing, since I had been disappointed in the 
drumming of my "staged" evenings of vaudou. 
About seven forty five one of the hounsi canzo took 
the ason and began invokation to Papa Legba, who 
must be called at the commencement of every dance because he, 
like St. Peter is the keeper of the keys or, to put it the 
Haitian way, he always stands in the gateway and 
decides whether the worshipper shall pass through to adore 
the loa. 
((49B1)
Papa Legba, ouvri barriere, 
Ouvri barriere, Atibon, pou' moin passer la, 
Papa Legba, ouvri barriere. 
Papa Legba, open the gate, 
Open the gate, Atibon, for me to pass by, 
Papa Legba, open the gate.
