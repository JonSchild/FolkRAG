THE HOUSE THAT REX BUILT

This is the house that Rex built.

These are the men, down by the creek,
Who pay for the house that Rex built.

This is the Dictator, puffeed and sleek
Who bosses the men down by the creek,
Who pay for the house that Rex built.

This is the ball game, out of pique
Ordered by the Dictator puffed and sleek
Who bosses the men down by the creek,
Who pay for the house that Rex built.

This is the keg of beer to leak
And assist the ball game, out of pique
Ordered by the Dictator puffed and sleek
Who bosses the men down by the creek,
Who pay for the house that Rex built.

This is the community spirity, meek,
Produced by the keg of beer that leaked
And assisted the ball game, out of pique,
Ordered by the Dictator puffed and sleek,
Who bosses the men down by the creek,
Who pay for the house that Rex built.

This is the arm of the law called queek (quick)
To quiet the community spirit meek,
Produced by the keg of beer that leaked
And assisted the ball game, out of pique,
Ordered by the Dictator puffed and sleek,
Who bosses the men down by the creek,
Who pay for the house that Rex built.
