Mr. E. E. Moss, Manager
Clemens State Farm
Brazoria, Texas

Dear Mr. Moss:

I have looked into my files and I discover that
it is possible that the Smith Cason I wrote you about
before is alias for one Roger Gill. If that is so, I
would appreciate you passing on the inclosed letter to
him. If that doesn't prove to be true, this might prove
to refresh your memory about the man. In my fathers notes
I discovered that Smith Cason had played on the program
"Behind the Walls" on numberous occassions. 

I hope that through on of these bits of information
you will be able to locate Mr. Cason, so that we can 
release his record and pay him for his services. Thank you
in advance, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
