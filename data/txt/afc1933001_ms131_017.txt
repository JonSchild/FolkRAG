Dear Mr. Lomax:
In the winter I teach 
at Connersville, Indiana, 
and your letter has just 
reached me, having been 
forwarded from Boonville
Miss Wilkin had told 
me of her conversation with 
you about our interest in 
folk songs, so I was not

to read a brief paper on play party games in 
Indiana! By the way, I can't sing either,
except to carry tunes. I suppose that's 
all you would expect.
I hope it will be possible for us to make
some arrangements convenient for us all.
We are surely interested in your work and 
shall be delighted if we can in any 
way assist in it.
Very sincerely yours,
Edith Del Hopkins
