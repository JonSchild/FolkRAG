turning, carrying on toward the
bottom of the road, finding the
road's name changes  every five
blocks & the left wheeling
roundabouts spinning one off
again at a new tangent, always
peering through a fog on all the
windows, the windshield and the
back, until the monster has crushed
all the pleasure out of the trip,
& one is simply running down his
maw to get to the fire & the
bed & the drink where one belongs 
It doesn't matter where aftr awhile.
I can understand the cheerfulness 
of the British, the Londoner, You
just have to learn to keep your courage
up as you fight your way through
the coils of the monster. I understand
why everyone prefers to live
in the country & come in as seldom
