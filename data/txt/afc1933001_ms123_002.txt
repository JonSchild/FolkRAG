Dear Mr. Hanson:

Your letter has been referred to me for an answer, since 
John A. Lomax is out of town.

I am sorry to say that for the present the Archive's only 
material on Acadian and Creole folk-song is inaccessible to the 
public. The songs are all recorded on discs and since the discs 
are master discs, and since these discs are irreplaceable, and, 
besides, wear out upon repeated playings, they cannot be played
by anyone, much less leave the Library. We hope to arrange for 
the duplication and general distribution of these records as 
soon as we get the equipment for making such duplicates. At present, 
however, the material is not available even to a serious 
student like yourself. I am sincerely sorry, and I shall let 
you know as soon as we can furnish duplicates of the records you 
might be interested in examining. We should be happy to receive
a copy of your thesis.

In the meantime, I remain,
Sincerely your,
AL:ep
[*Creole*]
