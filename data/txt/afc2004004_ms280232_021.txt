10) Says the Berwickers unto Sir John,
"O what's become o' all your men?"
"I' faith," says he, "I dinna ken,
I left them all this morning."
11) Now JOHNNy troth he wasna blithe,
To come with the news of your own defeat,
And leave your men in sich a strait
Sae early in the morning.
12) "I' faith," quoth Johnny, "I got a flag (?)
Wi' their claymores and fillabags (?)
If I face them again de'il break my legs,
Sae I wish ye all good morning.

Come o'er the stream Charlie, dear Charlie, brave Charlie,
Come o'er the stream Charlie, and done wi' McClean.
And though ye feel weary we'll make your heart cheery,
We'll welcome our Charlie and his loyal train.

And another song on the rebellion - Falkirk Muir.
1) I hae but just a word to say
And ye maun hear it all, Holly,
Were come to charge wi' sword and targe
And nae to hunt ava, Holly.
When we come doon amang the toon,
And soon nane ave, Holly,
We couldnae sooth, believe the truth
That ye had left us all, Holly.
Chorus:
Up and rin awa', Holly,
Up and rin awa', Holly,
The hieland dirk is at your dowk
And that's the hieland law.
2) Nae man bedeem believed his e'en.
Till your brave back he saw, Holly.
The bastard brat o' foreign cat
Had neither pluck nor paw, Holly.
We didna ken but ye were men,
Would fight for foreign law, Holly,
Gae fell your weim wi' brose at home
It fits ye best o' all, Holly. (cho.)
