NO IRISH NEED APPLY
Sure I was out the other night, on such a wild-goose chase,
I saw in an advertisement, about a decent place;
It is myself that it would suit well, but I cannot tell you why,
The lady said, "Did you not read? No Irish need apply."
If it is my country you dislike, I'm sure I don't know why,
Faith, it's all blarney when you say "No Irish need apply."
Just take a trip to Ireland, they will treat you like a man,
The whiskey they'll pour into you, as long as you can stand;
With heart and hand they'll welcome you, tell me the reason why,
Our ears offend with that dirty end, "No Irish need apply."
So just look out and mind yourself for I say by and bye,
You all lose your senses when you say, "No Irish need apply."
You talk about your soldiers, no tell me, if you can,
If the bravest of them all are not Irishmen;
In Russia, and in China too, and India by-the-bye,
You never say when you want men, "No Irish need apply."
For if you want good soldiers, listen to me, by-the-bye,
Would you ever had a Wellington if "No Irish need apply."
Of generals and statesmen old Ireland can boast,
Her poets too, 'tis well known to you, are universal toasts;
There's Campbell, Moore, and Lover, and Goldsmith, by-the-bye,
You could not get their equals, if "No Irish need apply."
You talk about your country, but you know 'tis all my eye,
For the best feather in your cap, is when the Irish do apply.
When the Queen was in Ireland enjoying the jaunting car,
The true hearted boys they shouted out, "Cead mille failta";
To defend her Majesty they would fight and die,
And prove to the world, that "Irish need apply."
So to conclude, toss off your glass, I see no reason why,
You should put in your advertisement, "No Irish need apply."
