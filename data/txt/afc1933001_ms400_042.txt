From this letter there came in a batch of unique manuscripts, none
of which have seen the light, much of which are of the type likenesses are
kept locked away from young and innocent readers. But long before any replies
reached me, this letter on one occasion, was flung back into my face
under circumstances that made the incident one of the most embarassing and
unhappy moments of my life.

At Columbia, my friend, Professor Reed Smith of the University of
South Carolina had introduced me to the Governor. That gentlemen gave me a 
note to the warden of the big, gloomy prison located on the outskirts of
the city. At the prison gates the guards bluntly refused entrance to my
companion and chauffeur, one Leadbelly. I left him in the car gloomy and
uneasy because so many "laws" were close by, angry probably at another instance
of race discrimination, more miserable from an acking tooth he had
refused to have [p]treated. I remember when I came back, the car was spatted
with blood. Leadbelly had been trying to pull his molar with the plyers.

From the reception office I sent the Governor's note in to the Warden.
Almost instantly the messenger returned. He took me to a room where five or
six grim faced men sat about a table. I sensed trouble in the cold greeting.
No one shook my hand. The warden shoved my circular letter at me and asked,
"Are you the man that wrote that letter?" (By error the letter had been sent to this state prison)

"Yes sir" -- very timidly.

"Then you are the very man we are looking for. These gentlemen and
I are here discussing the best ways and means to handle an incipient riot
in this prison. We already have six of the leaders confined in dark cells
for provoking trouble. That letter is the source.of what may become a serious
prison outbreak. And here comes the man who has brought it all about with
a request from the Governor that I allow the prisoners to sing for him"!
He flung the papers on the table and, in his nervousness and excitement, rose
from [the table] his chair and paced the room. The other five inquisitors sat and smoked
slowly, boring me with unfriendly looks from unfriendly eyes. Suddenly the
Warden turned and added,

"Why, sir, if I should let it be known that the'man from Washington'
had come, and then permit you to walk across the prison yard, a riot would
be on in five minutes. I couldn't be responsible for what would happen. You
get away from this place at once and don't tell anyone else who you are. And
go quick".

I didn't wait for a second invitation. As I was leaving he fired a 
final blasting shot.

"I notice, too, that in your damned letter you asked us to send in to
the Library of Congress all the vulgar songs these men know. What in the
hell do you want with dirty songs? And did you think we would violate postal
laws to send indecent stuff through the mails?" I don't [think] believe Professor
Kittredge who had [asked] advised me to save all types of folk stuff could have appeased
that angry and outraged warden. He was still pointing to the door. This
time I left without more ado.
