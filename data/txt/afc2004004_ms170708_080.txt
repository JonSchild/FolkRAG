In Barningham town  there lived a man, 
And he had such a lovely - lovely wife
And so - what?

Cox:
In Barningham town there lived a man
And he had such a lovely wife,
And so dearly she loved company,
As dearly as she loved her life, boys, life,
As dearly as she loved her life.

And this poor man he goesto sea
His living for to gain;
And where he spend one penny, she spend two,
And it's all for the want of wit, boys, wit,
And it's all for the want of wit.

When this poor man came home from sea
It bein' late in the night,
In quirin' for his own dear wife,
Was his joy an' his delight, boys, 'light.
Was his joy an' his delight.
