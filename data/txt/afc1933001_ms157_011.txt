Dear Mr. Lomax:

We were hoping before this to receive the additional information 
requested in our letter of April 23rd about
"Oh, Didn't He Ramble."

We are inclined to believe, as you suggest, that "Oh,
Didn't He Ramble" was not a new composition at the time
of the Cole (Handy) copyright in 1902, but we are equally
convinced that it is not taken from "The Ram of Derby",
as references which you supplied indicate that the tune
is something different.

Will you kindly let us hear from you as soon as possible
regarding this matter.

Very truly yours,

H. C. Darnell
Manager of Copyright Section.
