EIGHT          THE NASHVILLE TENNESSEAN          Friday Morning, March 20, 1942

Letter Everybody's Read
(Continued From Page One)
if you wanted to look at it that
way, but most times a reporter is
a reporter whenever and wherever
there's a story and this was a story.
"Lady," he said, leaning over, "excuse
me for eavesdropping. I
didn't mean to. But I'm a reporter 
for The Tennessean and I just
heard that story about the letter.
And I'd like to know the name of
the lady who got the letter–could
you tell me?"
The lady was very nice and didn't
take offense at the unintended 
eavesdropping, but she was sorry
she couldn't tell him any more than
she'd already told. Seems another
woman called her mother and told
her. No, she didn't want to tell
her mother's name and the lady
who'd called her mother was an
old lady–she was highly nervous
–and she wouldn't giver her name,
either. Nor would the lady give
her own name–she didn't want to
get mixed up in a story. Her
mother hadn't slept all night after
she heard that story. The lady
was nice about it, but firm–she
wouldn't tell anything else.
And It Is Told Again
Then a lady told us about it.
Seems that a man had told her, and
this man said he knew the woman
who'd received the letter. It was
terrible that such a thing could
happen. We agreed it was terrible,
but for a different reason. Terrible
that such a story should appear
to be gaining such circulation.
So we tried to locate the lady
who knew the mother–but couldn't
find her.
Mother Located–No Letter
Right after that, the story began
breaking out like wildfire.
Another reporter got a telephone
call the next morning. It was a
man calling.
"Look," said the man, "I just
heard a story you ought to know
about. It's an awful story and I
don't know what you'll think, but
seems to me the paper ought to
know about it."
Then he told the story about the
letter. The letter from a Japanese
prison camp to a Nashville woman.
And the letter telling how well the
boy was being treated, etc., and
then it said, "Be sure to keep this
stamp for my collection." The 
mother thought that was strange,
because her son didn't have a stamp
collection. So she steamed off the
stamp and there was the message.
Did the man know the name of
the boy and mother? The reporter
of course expected the man to say
no, he didn't, but for the first time,
the answer was yes. He knew the
name of the mother and the boy
and where the mother lived.
The reporter checked the clipping
files to see if there was anything
about such a boy being in the army
or navy. Sure enough, there was a 
story. Not only that, the boy had
been captured. With no further delay,
the reporter hired a taxi and
went to see the mother.
Two Letters, Nothing Unusual
He asked if she had heard from
her boy. Yes, she said, she had.
She had received two letter from
amateur radio operators who had
picked up short wave radio broadcasts
from Tokyo, the kind that
have been sent from many men
captured at Wake and Guam, saying
her son was alright.
Had she received a letter directly
from her son? No, she hadn't.
Had the letter she received said
anything about the stamps, anything
unusual? No, they were just
plain stamps. And both letters said
the same thing–her boy was well
and she was happy to know it, having
been worried about him as any
mother would since he'd ben reported
captured. That was all she'd
heard from her son. (Of course the
reporter didn't repeat the story to
the mother, but he definitely established
she was not the one who'd
received THE letter.)
So next morning the reporter telephoned
the man who had called
him and told him he was wrong
about the name of the mother and
son. And said the story was just
as phoney as it had seemed in
the first place. This time the man
agreed it probably was. But where
had he heard the report naming
the mother and son? He explained
he'd heard it from a Mr. ______.
So the reporter called Mr. _____
and Mr. _____ said yes, he'd
heard the story from a young lady,
one of the young ladies in his office,
but he couldn't be sure which one.
And she'd heard it from someone
else, who in turn–so on, ad infinitum.
Heard In Washington, Too
But before we end this part of
the story, we must tell you that this
man who had called the reporter
went on to explain why now he was
convinced the story was phoney. It
seemed that on the day he first
heard the story, he happened to be
writing a friend in Washington.
So he told him the story. And just
that day he had received a reply
from his friend. His friend wrote
that the story was very interesting
but he didn't much think it was
true since he had just heard it told
as having happened to a Washington
boy.
That was why we said in the
beginning that at least two people
in Washington knew about it
and we supposed a great many
more have heard it by now, since
stories spread there, too, just like
in Nashville.
She Was Wrong Mrs. X
This is getting to be too long
for a story that isn't news. But
we have to tell you just a little
more. We have to tell you, in
fact, the end of the story–or what
we believe to be the end.
The next time we heard it was
from a young lady in the office.
Another young lady had told her
about it and had gone on to say
she had heard it definitely from
a Mrs. X. who knew the mother
and all about it. Which Mrs. X
knew all about it? we asked. She
gave us the lady's first name.
So we called Mrs. X. That was
very interesting, the lady said in
her nice way, but she'd never heard
such a story. Only thing she could
think of was maybe she had been
confused with another Mrs. X. We
might call her.
We did. And the second Mrs.
X said yes, she had heard the
story, but she had no idea who
the mother was or the son. Where
had she heard it? She'd have
to think a minute–oh, yes, Mrs.
Soandso had told her.
So we called Mrs. Soandso–
Now, we won't go into the details
of the nine telephone calls
that followed. We will just tell
you a few random things said by
some of the people, women and
men, we contacted in this merry-go-round.
"Why, I didn't take it seriously
when I heard it. Just seemed like
a joke to me–you know how people
talk. I didn't tell it to anybody
for the truth. It seemed so
ridiculous."
"I'm certainly glad you think it
isn't true–I didn't sleep a wink
that night after I heard it."
"I didn't think much abou tit
one way or another. But i[? ????]
seem strange that a letter [????]
have got to this country from [??]pan."
"I heard it two or three times
from folks."
"I think you ought to write a
piece in the paper about it. I've
got a boy in the army and two
or three boys in my neighborhood 
are going soon."
"Well, I certainly hope it isn't
so. As my husband said when I
told him–he said maybe it was
started by somebody who wanted
to create a scare among people in
this country."
On and on and on, it went. And
then, finally, the seventh, eighth
or ninth person we talked with–
we don't remember which– said
yes, he'd heard it and he knew the
lady who had the letter. We
could call her.
Letter Told Her of It
This time we went out to see the
lady. She, like the others, was 
mighty nice in telling what she
knew about it. Get a letter? Yes,
she recalled it must have been a
month or so ago she got a letter
–from Detroit–and it told about
a girl there who had gotten a letter
from her boy friend who was
in the army and he had been captured
somewhere and he had said
he was getting along fine and keep
the stamp for him. And, underneath
the stamp was written the
message.
She went on to say she didn't
recall much else about it–probably
she had mentioned the letter as
anyone will do. If the story was
true, she said, she'd like to know
about it, but really she didn't much
think it was. And she hoped we'd
write something in the paper saying
it wasn't true, because it was
a terrible sort of thing.
We promised her to write a piece.
Only thing we wanted to ask of her
was to give us the name of the
person who'd written her from Detroit.
She gladly gave us the name
and address.
Variation of Old Story
So we telephoned long distance
the City Editor of the Detroit Free 
Press and told him the story. You
know, come to think of it, we
have the feeling now the City Editor
up there sort of thought we
were goofy, telling him all that
on the telephone, long distance.
But he agreed to send a reporter
to see the Detroit lady who had
written the Nashville lady.
And he did. Today we received
a telegram from him saying: "Mrs.
_____ doesn't know anything about
the story of mother getting letter
from son with message underneath
stamp saying his tongue had been
cut off. Sounds like same fake
story that went around with variations
in first World War."
And that's the end of the story.
At least, as far as Nashville is concerned.
As the announcer says–Take it
away, Detroit!
No Mail From Japan
Just one thing more. We thought
we ought to tell you this last item,
having to do with a telegram from
our Washington Bureau. The other
day when we first heard the story,
we thought it might be interesting
to find out if it was possible for
a letter to have come through from
a boy captured in Japan to his
mother in America.
Our bureau wired us as follows:
"OFFICE OF CENSOR SAYS
FLATLY NO MAIL ROM AMIERCAN
PRISONERS IN JAPAN HAS
BEEN RECEIVED IN THIS
COUNTRY. NOR CAN MAIL BE
EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES AND JAPAN
BECAUSE THAT COMES UNDER 
THE TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
ACT."

3 Allied Ships
Make Sub Toll 41
Freighter, Tanker and
Merchant Vessel Sunk
Off Atlantic Coast
By The Associated Press
Submarine torpedoes and shellfire,
destroying three Allied vessels,
lifted the toll of ships officially
announced as attacked off the
United States Atlantic coast to 41
yesterday.
One was the 5,402-ton Yugoslavian
freighter Trepca, whose
sinking was disclosed after 33 survivors
of a crew of 37 landed at
Lewes, Del. Another was identified
by the navy as a Norwegian
tanker, with 38 of the 40-man crew
saved, and the third was listed as
a medium sized merchant ship with
38 out of 47 men surviving.
Survivors of the merchant ship,
arriving in Miami, Fla., from Havana,
said the ship's radio operator
stayed at his post after the vessel
was torpedoed and managed to
send distress signals in spite of
shellfire aimed at the radio shack.
Sends Call for Help
"Right after the torpedo hit, the
sub surfaced and fired four times,"
one crewman asserted. "The water
was pouring in, and the ship
sinking about a foot a minute, but
"Sparks" stayed on duty until he
could get his S O. S away."
In New York City, six survivors
from the Trepca, who were among
those landed at Lewes, blamed the
loss of their ship on Friday the
13th, the wireless operator declaring
that the ship sailed from its
Caribbean port on a Friday and
it was attacked on Friday, March 13.
Four men, the only ones known
to have been lost, were killed instantly
by the surprise torpedo
blast, two of the lifeboats were destroyed,
and the radio damaged,
preventing an appeal for help.
Captain Stanko Marochini declared
in Lewes, Del., that the attack
was carried out "by a cruiser
sub, the largest I have ever seen,
apparently German."
Survivors of the Trepca drifted
three days in open lifeboats
through rain, fog and cold before
being rescued by a Swedish
freighter.
Identity of the Norwegian tanker
was not disclosed. Its sinking was
first reported from Nassau, the
Bahamas, on March 10, two days
after 38 survivors of the 40-man
crew arrived there.
Thirty-four survivors of the
tanker were brought to New York
City.
