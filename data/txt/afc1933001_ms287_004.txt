Here's some straight talk from a prisoner to a prison

"Cap'n, if I get a letter and mama says, come home,

Here's a quatrain from an 80-year old Kentucky mountain
woman about a mermaid:
"She was coming down her long yellow hair,

"The sun rose, my dear friends,
And it recognized Jesus hanging on the cross.

And each little star leaped out of its silver orbit
To make the torches of a dark and unbenointed world."]
