[*Alan Lomax*]

   Pending receipt of the proposed grant from the American
Council of Learned Societies, Mr. Alan Lomax is sorely in
need of funds for the immediate payment of tuition fees.
My efforts to obtain a loan for him from the Strong Foundation
have been unsuccessful.

   I suggested to Mr. Bond that the Welfare Committee lend
Mr. Lomax the necessary sum, $250.  Mr. Bond agreed to this
loan subject to your approval.
