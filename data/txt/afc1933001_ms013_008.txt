written, though I think legible
manuscript of a lot of the
recorded songs. This manuscript
should be type-written
under the eyes of Alan or myself.
I do not wish to spend
any of our grant for such a
purpose, nor do I know the
precise form you would
wish for the type-written
sheets. If these two matters
could be determined, I think it
would be far better to send
in the Ms. in type-written form,
probably with the field notation
sheets attached.
We are off to the field
again this week.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
