The borrowers of the Park Blvd Branch make few comments one way or the other on the news of the day. In fact, they seem to be rather apathetic about the whole war situation.
The only rumors (if they can be called such) noted at this branch during the time August 10th to 15th are the following:
A woman told us that she had it on good authority that the soldiers sent to the [*1*] desert in Southwestern United States for military maneuvers were being prepared for action in Libya.
Monday, August 10, 1942 Oakland Calif 
A secon version of the same story came from the young wife of soldier who stated she was glad her husband hadnt been sent on the maneuvers in the American desert because everyone knew that they would be sent to North Africa when they were completed. Wednesday, August 12th [*Oakland, Calif*]
