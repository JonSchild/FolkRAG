is dubious. 

But we have been the discoverers and first
publisher and I have felt that where
I could wangle a fee for the reuse
of our finds I was entirely
in my rights. As I feel, I have
just as much right to demand payment 
from Burl Ives and Columbia
Recording Co. as I did from C.B.S. and
the fact that CBS swindled me
does not lessen the obligation of
the afore-mentioned group of high
binders, however friendly the are
to you. Put these scattering, feeble
remarks in your pipe and smoke
'em. Of the two groups I prefer the
cold cash crowd, however hard-bitten,
to the bunch that feed you only
on the pap of sweet words and
sugared sentiments. Stay with
'em Texas!

If the machine stays here I'll
need a few more records. I'll ship those
I've made as soon as Miss Terrill finishes
typing the best list of notes you've seen
Lovingly, Father.
