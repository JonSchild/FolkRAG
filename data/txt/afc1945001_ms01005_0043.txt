RUMOR REPORT
(This study is far from definitive. A very broad conception
of rumor was used: any spontaneously expressed statement 
relating to the war, presented as a statement of fact rather than 
as a personal opinion, with some implication that it derives from
sources not available to the listener. Cooperation was secured
from reporters through the nation, but no systematic sampling was
made. Inasmuch as some rumors spread in particular social networks,
we cannot use absence from our list to mean that the story is not circulating;
nor can we use relative frequencies to be an accurate index
of the relative prevalence in the community at large. No approach
was made to problem of rumor among special groups, e.g. it is likely
that people who are uprooted and transported to new communities
are especially susceptible to rumor -- not having a stable and
appropriate reference frame to check stories against. This would
mean (apart from newly inducted soldiers) that migrant workers,
women newly introduced into the labor market, etc., should be given
especial study.)
