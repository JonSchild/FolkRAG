BJ TAPE 15, p. 67

said that he first should, should not been out that long.  You
know.  Over night or half a night or near 'bout mornin', an' comin'
home, see?  Yeah, he won't say nothin' about it.  Git in his bed,
an' shet that room if he can.  An' I miles an' miles.  He tell me,
"You sho' oughta git tired."  Hu, hu, hu!
AL:  What?
BJ:  "You oughta git tired."   Hah, I be jus' miles an' miles, an'
miles an' miles.  Sometime he say, "My goo'ness, you oughta git
tired!"  Huh!  He can say it so good!
     But ya see, it's jus', it's jus' because if you wanna git along.
Tha's all; you wanna git along.
AL:  You wouldn't fuss at him when he come in so late, huh?
BJ:  Well, I mean, if, if, if I -- When, when I was pregnant, I
raised some bunch a sand.  I just raised sand, miles of it, miles of
it.  "Go back where you was. . .You come here just a-stayed all night somewhere
an' come back."  Look at the clock an' it around two an'
three o'clock.  "What in the world you come here for?"  That's. . .
all like that.  I talked an' I talked up.  He'd be eatin'.  He'd
keep on eatin'.  If he ain't he jus' go an' git in the bed an' lay
down.  An' I - He'd wake up -- I don' know whether he be asleep or
not -- but sometime he, he'd raise up his haid:  "Great Godamighty!
You oughta git tired!"  "Num-num-num-num-num, num-num-num-num-num,
num-num-num."  Hah, ha, ha, ha!
      An' he act, an' he ain't got angry -- What made me so mad, he'd go
to act like he was snorin'.  Ooow, boy!  That's when I was pregnant.
If I ain't pregnant, it didn't worry me.  No-ho-ho-ho, 
not one bit.  When I was pregnant I was cheerful
as a mule!  Hum, hum.
     But that was never -- I ain't never called him nothin' bout his
name; he never called me nothin' 'bout mine.  Never.  In no way,
