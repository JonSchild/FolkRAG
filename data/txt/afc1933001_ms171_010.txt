Mr. Alan Lomax
The Gunter Hotel
San Antonio, Texas

Dear Alan:

First let me give you a piece of news that will make you very
happy. We are not using any of Mrs. Flander's songs in the Friends of
Music Album. As a matter of fact, the Friends of Music are only issuing
Carlisle, The Mule Driver's Holler, and The Work Song Chorus from
Richmond, Virginia. Jerry did not find it possible to make pressings of
all the records on your list as yet but the first ones which have arrived
are very encouraging and excit all those who hear them. I am quite
optimistic about the whole proposition of issuing pressed discs.

The Senate Committee has not even reported as yet and so we are
still marking time on many things. This includes, of course, the proposed
cooperation with Fisk University. I shall await your return before doing
anything else along the line of recording trips, etc.

I shall leave it to you to arrange your return trip in any
manner you please. I shall, of course, recommend reimbursement of per
diem as soon as I have authority to do so. At the present moment I sit
here with my allotment completely used up and find myself in a big hole
because of previous commitments. I am sure, however, that everything
will work out to our satisfaction.

Please write me in greater detail about the Brazilian matter. I
heard a rumor that there was some American in Brazil with a recording machine
who was making himself cordially disliked. Perhaps that is the man to whom
you refer. At any rate, I spoke to a professor of the Brazilian University
yesterday who was most enthusiastic when she heard the possibility of your
coming to Brazil with a recording machine. Please remember that that
country is almost as big as ours and no one man can possibly exhaust its
possibilities even in ten years.

Jerry is rushing the records for Morris and will have them
out in a few hours. Dr. Fenton speaks tonight but Father has not shown
up as yet. I think that Luther Evans will make the introductory talk.

With kindest regards,
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
