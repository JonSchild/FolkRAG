And join me in a promise,
That you'll to glory go.
Then when our labor's ended,
And time shall be no more,
We'll go and live with mother,
Where parting is no more.

THE ORPHAN GIRL

No home, no home, cried a little girl, as
She stood on the Prince's hall.
Trembling she stood on the marble steps
And leaned on the polished wall.

Her clothes were thin and her feet were bare,
And the snow had covered her head.
Give me a home, she feebly cried,
A home and a bite of bread.

A father's love I never knew,
And tears dropped from her eyes,
My mother sleeps in a new made grave,
"Tis an orphan here tonight.

The night was dark and the snow fell fast,
As the rich man closed his door;
His proud lips curled as he scornfully said:
"No home nor bread for the poor."

I must freeze, I must freeze, the trembling child 
cried.
And sank on the steps of the door,
To wrap her feet in her tattered dress,
All covered with sleet and snow.

The hours rolled on and the midnight storm,
Rolled on like a funeral knell,
The earth seemed wrapped in a winding sheet
And the chilly snow still fell.
