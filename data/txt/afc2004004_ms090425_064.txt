Fisk, 22. 1.   [*Baptist lady on spirituals*]

Arnie Williams. Friar's Point. Dr. Watts.

A: Are the hymns any different than they used to be?
W: What do you mean? I don't see where they are any different now.
(Conversation to children)
A: Is Dr. Watts the same as it used to be?
W: Well, Dr. Watts is the same. Course you give out to--it's--let
me see--was showing a lot. Dr. Watts come from what Dr. Watts had
sing. I give it out and Dr. Watts looked in the saucer, and he says
it is the same. And he made a hymn out, and Dr. Watts saw different
things that he made hymns out. So when we give out a hymn out of
that book, we say we're gonna sing one of Dr. Watts' hymns. Dr. Watts
got some hymns in there that he 'posed and give out.
A: Well, where did the folks in the old days--they couldn't read--
how did they learn that?
W: Well, some of um knowed them and the others learned um. I don't
know where these books were--how they got ahold of um. 
As I told you yesterday, I don't know-- they don't look to me like
any of the oldtime folks back here in ancient days even
knowed A from B. They went to no school. They got no learning. But
I've heard my grandmaw say times that Old Master would have um all
go up to the house Sunday morning and give a line of catechism and take
a line of lessons. And the old men and the old sisters would say they
had to move in, give a Testament, would learn the Testament. That's
the way they got um. I don't see any other way they got um-- they
didn't have no schools to go to. They didn't have nothing but catch
what they could. 
A: How'd you get your learning?
W: How'd I get my learning? I ain't got none much (laughter).
A: You learned how to read.
