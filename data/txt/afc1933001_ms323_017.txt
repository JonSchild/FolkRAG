FIESTA CALENDAR HIGHWAY INFORMATION

Jan 1st. Janitzio Island, Lake Patzcuaro, Mich. An interesting fiesta on this quaint fishermen's island, including the famous indigenous dances known as "Los Viejitos" and "Los Moros."

San Barolo Otzolotepec, State of Mexico. An animated unspoiled festival in this little town near Toluca Dance of the "Concheros."

 Jan. 6th. Chalma, State of Mexico. Minor festival at the holy sanctuary, reached only by horseback.

Jan 15th. Zimatlan, Oax. Colorful fiesta, especially noteworthy for the beautiful "Plume Dance" as well as other native dances typical of the region. Also a fiesta at Tenango del Valle, a few miles from Toluca.

Jan. 17th. In many town in Mexico, St. Anthony's day is set aside for the interesting and very old ceremony, that of blessing the animals. Typical is the ceremony held in the church of San Bernardino in Xochimilco, near Mexico City.

Jan. 25th. Cuilapan and Mitla, Oaxaca. Colorful fiestas in each place, with renditions of the lovely Plume Dance and in Zimatl치n (see above)

Palmatl치n, Puebla. A very unusual festival in this small isolated town in the puebla mountains, particularly outstanding for its elaborate pre-Spanish spectacle "Los Voladores". As this town can be reached only by train followed by a 3-hour trip on horseback, special trip arrangements should be made beforehand. For the student of folklore, however, this fiesta is one of the most unusual of all, due to its primitive, utterly unspoiled character.

Jan. 27-28.  Cuilapan, Oaxaca, near Oaxaca City. Splendid presentation of the beautiful "Plume Dance."

THIS MONTH'S COVER
Visitors to Mexico are amazed at the almost fantastic loveliness of some of the many varieties of cactus flowers seen throughout the highland regions of the country. Ranging from tiny blossoms to huge blooms, many of these flowers reflect a fare beauty generally associated only with the most exotic of tropical flowers.

Pictured on the front cover is a flower of the Nopalillo cactus, a type common throughout Mexico. this particular variety produces from five to twenty gorgeous flowers each year, which bloom one at a time and only during the night - and only for one night, following which the flower withers and dies. These flowers attain the size of a large dahlia, and in their wax-like perfection and delicate shape they reflect a beauty which is almost unreal. The particular variety illustrated is pure white; others, practically identical in shape and size, are of delicate blue or yellow color. Still others which are similar bloom only during the day - and for but one day.
