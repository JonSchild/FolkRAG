Mr. Carl Engel
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C..

Dear Mr. Engel;

I have sent Mr. Garwick full payment for his bill together
with my apologies for delay in its payment.  For several weeks I
have been on the go almost constantly, lecturing ten times in seven different
states.  These lectures* I had promised early last fall, one of them
to the William Vaughan Moody Foundation of the University of Chicago.  I 
might say that at every place my introducer told of my connection with the
Library of Congress and its project to gather American folk-songs in a 
recorded form-- a fine advertisement for the project, and, heaven knows, we
need all the leads we can get.  Mack Evans choirmaster of the University of
Chicago, has begged us to send him a recording of some fine group singing
among the Negroes so that he may try it out with his music groups.

The Los Pastores, native Mexican folk play about the birth
of Christ, is very long, lasting three, four, sometimes five hours.  Even
though we could delete part of the dialogue in recording it, the whole affair
would be quite expensive.  And so, within the week, I am sending you a 
few samples of the music that we recorded in South Texas.  If you find that
interesting enough to justify the recording of the whole folk opera, it 
will be easy enough, I think, to stage a performance.  the Texas Folk Lore
Society meets here in three weeks and through them we can discover where
the Pastores is preserved most purely by oral tradition.

I have a great many things that I want to write you about
soon.  Be sure to send me a half dozen copies of the Musical Quarterly 
when it comes off the press.

Sincerely Yours,
JohnA. Lomax,
John A. Lomax

*No more lectures this year.  Alan and
I will give through 1934 all our time
to folk-song collecting.
