Tape:  1312 cont. Octa and Dion    3
Octa:  Well you got to learn, there's a lot of things to learn.
You got to learn to keep the people excited.  And you got to
play for them and you get used to that.  I know how to play how
to make them feel good, happy.   . . . .And if you. . . . . . . they're
going to sleep on you, they don't like that too much.  And
if they're happy, well, they're going to stay, like last night,
they danced and they danced.  They like that.  And that's the
way you got to learn.
AL:  The dances we were looking at last night, were they old
time or have they changed themall?
Dion:  Some of them were dancing good and some of just learning.
But you find a few of them there who was good.
AL:  Did they have all that twirling when you were a young man?
Dion:  No.  Jitterbug, I don't know what years that was, there
was a lot of twirlingin the jitterbug, but we had mostly 2-step
and the waltz.
AL:  Now you all didn't make music professionally all your
lives, did you?  You worked at other jobs.  What was your job,
Mr. Clark?  You owned your own farm?  How big?
Octa:  I had 54 acres of land.  I don't have that much land,
I have 49.
AL:  What did you raise?
Octa:  Well, at that time I raised almost everything.  I raised
chicken, I raised hogs, cows. . .all kinds. . . I make my own things
I make a lot of corn, so I feed them with that.  Now when I get
sick I can't do it no more.
