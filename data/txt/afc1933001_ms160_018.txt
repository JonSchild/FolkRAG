Dear Mr. Lomax:

     On account of family matters, it has been absolutely 
impossible for me to attend to any correspondence here lately, I hope 
you did not think I meant to ignore your letter!

     I am hoping you may still find it possible to come to
White Top. However, it is very doubtful that I can be there myself.
I have not been in Marion or worked up the festival since my husband's 
death in 1937, but have been extending the White Top work in Maine,
here in Richmond and elsewhere. Some day I shall go on with the festival
work too, but while I have not the money for it at present, John
Blakemore, the manager, is going on with it, and John Powell always
attends and aids. While I am sure you would be most welcome there,
always, I do not feel that I would be in a position to say now whether
the whole festival might be recorded or night, simply because I am not
directing it this year. I am sure you will understand this. I suggest
that, if you find you can go after all (and again, I hope you can do so),
you write to John Blakemore, Manager, Abingdon, Virginia, or to John Powell,
Eastham, Virginia, who always acts as a sort of honorary director, helping
with advice and presence and participation in the festival itself, though
he does not help to get it up. You might tell them that you had been
invited by me to be present, and that I should be glad to have a part of
the festival recorded (I don't see how you could record it all), though
under our joint sponsorship and restrictions as to use, as you suggested.

     I am trying to finish another book this summer; I certainly 
wish you and your father all success with your new one.

Cordially,
Annabel M. Buchanan
