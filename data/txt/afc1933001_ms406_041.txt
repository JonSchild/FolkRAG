[*Georgian*]
Rhymes What is the Soul of Man, [???? used?]
I saw two standin' and talkin'
I just step up in time
I thought I heard 'em say
The soul ain't nothin' but the mind.
The "sinner measured the dis-
tance to the sun
And the distance to the moon
If you ever figure out the soul
of a man
You better go to figgerin' soon.
Rest of Hymn
I am a Christian
And yet I'm not ashamed
I love to meet God's people
And praise his Holy name.
