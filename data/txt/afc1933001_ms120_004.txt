[EARLY APRIL 1957]
Box A-32 
Port-au-Price,
Haiti,
Dear Spivacke,
The camera has turned into quite a white elephant. The American
minister won't admit the damn thing without a second special
authorization from the state department and my friends here in 
Port-au-Prince have for some reason changed their minds about
the adviseability of my taking any pictures at all. On top of 
that the international postal rules won't allow me to inspect the
camera and accessories without paying [duty] paid the duty which
is a hell of a lot more than I can afford. So I will have to
depend upon you to take care of the situation. It is absolutely
essential to h[ave] some sort of a filter, I think about equivalent
to the ordinary cloud filter to take soft, rich pictures
in the sort of sun we have here. Furthermore to prevent all chance
of glare it is essential that the camera either be fitted
with or have as an attachment a sunshade for the lens.
If these things were not sent with the camera, you'd better have
Eastman airmail them to me at once. As for film, I'm sure that
my time will not allow me to make more than six good rolls. I
do wish that you'd sent all color film, because everything is
cursedly beautiful here.
The whole mess is really the fault of the bast[ar]ds in the foreign
office here who haven't the good grace to make a broad interpretation
in my case in favor of admitting the camera [and]
[requesting] under the same authorization that they had from the
state department in regard to [my] the recording machine. They
simply won't listen to any reason---even when one quotes Herzog
and tells them that with a species of folk-songs that is emminently
for, by and of the dance one must have movies of the dance
to make anything out of the songs. They just don't respond to
anything but a lot of show, prestige or money and if you violate
one of their damn rules of proceedure and give them the chance
they rejoice in knifing you in the back. "Very unfortun[a]ate"
I wonder if you would call Dr. Putnam for me and [explain]
ask him to write a special letter to the Minister of Interior
(M. Frederique Duvigneaud) explaining the Library's reason
for wanting these pictures(I have detailed those reasons in
a recent letter[s] to the August Right Honorable), th at the
pictures are not destined for pulication and are only intended
for the use of specialists in the field of folk music.
Please tell old Voorus for me that if he doesn't get [me] my
checks for special and extraordinary expenses(from Feb 11 to
March 11) to me here in Port-au-Prince before the tenth
of the month I won't be able to leave Haiti or make a long-planned
and most necessary trip to the North on my way out. But,
Spivacke, darling caiman, the next two weeks are going to be the
most exciting of my life--- if I don't get arrested.
P;S: All these requests have exclamation marks of urgency
behind them..
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
