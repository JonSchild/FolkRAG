Lead Belly
Sings: 
"I've tried so hard to treat my people right, 
I've tried so hard to treat my people right, 
I've tried so hard to keep down a squabble an' a fight." 

*  "Monkey-man, according to Lead Belly, is a man, "that's
crazy about w[*im*]mens, always hangin' aroun', gives 'em all
his money an' never get nothin'."
