stop watch and held it over the Irishman's back
so that the sun's rays were focussed on
his back.  Pretty soon smoke started rising
from the Irishman's back.  He suddenly jumped
up and yelled, "The bet's off  I can stand 
your mosquitoes but one of those mosquitoes
must have just flown in from Ireland.
