Dear Mrs. Oursler:

In answer to your letter of September 27, 
Mr. Alan Lomax lives at 215 West 98th Street, Apt. 12E, 
New York, New York 10025.

I enclose a checklist of books relating to
American folk music which includes a number of books edited 
by the Lomaxes. Also enclosed is a catalog of the folk
song recordings available from the Library of Congress. As 
you will see, many of the songs and fiddle tunes were recorded
by the Lomaxes.

Sincerely yours,

(Mrs.)  Rae Korson
Head, Archive of Folk Song
