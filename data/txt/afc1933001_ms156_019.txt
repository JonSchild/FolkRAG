Mr. John A. Lomax
Dallas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I know that you will be distressed to hear that Father passed away on April 5th. I intended sending you the enclosed clipping from the local newspaper, but have been trying to find your Dallas address, which you gave me when you were last here. I trust that you will forgive the delay.

Sincerely yours,
[PAN?]
