Strachan: O aye ....
Sonny Sonisson he was there,
And well may he thrive,
For afore he gaee for his ain wife,
He'd gaed for another five!

O the nesters' daughters they were there,
And they were worst of all
They turned up their petticoats
And bade them come awa' !

Oh - it's a terrible ...But the Gordons at the beggining of the
war - it was their favourite song, and they sung it at ....

Lomax: What about the verses to some of the strathspeys you
were thinking of?
Strachan: Well you know ... Well, but look here, ye see ... 'Twas at
the school up there.  Oh, I was sent there before I was four.  My
mother was great friends with the schoolmistress and I was early
to school.  There wasna a lavatory at it.  You had to go outside.
Well, but this verse for instance ...
Loch Leven Castle and Loch Leven Glen,
You'll never get a sight o'my arse-hole again!
You see, they'd sit down outside, and you'd have to understand
that before.  This man was leaving, you see, and he had sat down
many a time outside Loch Leven Castle and Loch Leven Glen, but
he was away ... O that was one of them ... And there was another ...
Taw, twa made the bed,
Twa, twa lay doon together,
When the bed began to heat
They een lay on abend the other.
And then there's another awful good verse, I think ...
Some like the lassie that gae weel dressed
Some like the lassie that's tight aboot the waist,
But it's in among the blankets that I like best
To get a jolly rattle at the cuckoo's nest.
It was always realistic - their verses, and they were bloody
clever often ...
Hamish: They were aye witty ...
Strachan: Indeed. My wife, noo.  If she kenned I'd sing this song
to ye - I couldna stay with you - and he very nearly played it, lad ..
Aboot maidenhads ....
