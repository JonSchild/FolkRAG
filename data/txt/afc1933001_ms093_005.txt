Dear Mr. Reese:

As Mr. John A. Lomax handles all permission requests for the use 
of material from his books, we have forwarded to him your recent 
letter asking about using "Stewball" from AMERICAN BALLADS AND FOLK 
SONGS in Mr. Kubik's orchestral work.

You should hear directly from his about the matter.

Sincerely yours,
Mary Lyon
