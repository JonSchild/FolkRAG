Blues I Got Make a New-Born Baby Cry

A two-step in fast time, this blues shows the influence
of the Tin Pan Alley.  The extravagant metaphors of the
last lines are modern and almost surely the brain-children
of some white man on Broadway who writes
blues for the recording companies. Let the reader make his
own contribution to the series, if he likes. For [insnatce:] instance:
Lemme be yo' chauffer, till o' chauffer come,
I can drive mo' miles than yo' chauffer ever done.
                            or
I can run mo' signals than yo' chauffer ever done.

Lead Belly puts this blues together again every time he sings it
and remembers it, not by any name or key stanza, but by the
guitar accompaniment.
