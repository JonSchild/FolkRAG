Dear Alan:
[?] my recent letters
reach you? You've probably
been out in the field or on 
your vacation.
Nineteen Jack [?] went off, in
final copy, to Houghton Mifflin on
Sept. 1. - and, liking round numbers
anyhow, I found the twentieth today
in the middle Charlottesville. 
[*Also some folk songs. (Woman is him
to rep. Chisholm, Aunt Betty Smith, Uncle Jim +c
-all C.[J?]. Sharp informants.) Want these recorded?*]
I haven't heard it
all yet, but it sounds like the one where the
devil gets caught by the chain, hammer, [?], and
then wont let Jack into hell. It was on the radio
a while back as "told" by an ancient fellow living
under Brooklyn bridge. You may have heard it.
-Halpert, by the way, may do the appendix for
The Jack Tales: he + [?] Thompson. "Appendix?
so what?" you might say! O well, Houghton Mifflin

The scope of the Society's work includes the collecting, editing, publishing, and active teaching
of all the musical traditions of English-speaking people: songs, ballads, carols, and folk hymns;
American folk-games and square sets, English and American country dances, English sword dances
and morris dances.
