-- quick music
8) Hector's widow would reel
and Jenet would set
And the old wife who was in Eig
said to the old wife that 
was from Achenterry,
If it weren't that the channel
was so wide
They would jump together

9) It was I that made the 
mistake the night I was on the
Sheiling by the loch
Word came for me, there came
a boy with a letter horse & saddle,
brown palfrey, spurs & saddle
son of the King of Denmark

One line in every stanza with repeated
It was I - hey [mandu
Who made the mistake - hey mandu
The night I was -- hoo vi o roo
On the shieling by the loch.
hey mandu -  hoo vi o ru
hey mandu - o--ro.
