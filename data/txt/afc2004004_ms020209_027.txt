younger generation blues

Words & Music: JANIS FINK
Â© 1966 by Janis Fink

I was sitting on the corner,
I was smoking on the sly
When along came a grown-up from the grown-up FBI,
Says this ain't Marlboro country hon,
Where'd you get those cigarettes,
You know you are too young;
Up stepped 3 more governmental nuts
Who'd been laying in the gutter disguised as cigarette butts. (To v.2) CHO:
If you think I hate grown-ups you've got me all wrong,
They're very nice people if they stay where they belong.
But I'm the younger generation
And your rules are giving me fixations,
I got them Younger Generation Regurgitating Blues.

2. They called up the sergeant, he rolled up in a hearse
And he called me a lousy no good juvenile pervert
He gave me a lecture on cancer of the lung
Said everyone who smokes is a low down dirty bum
Don't let me catch you smoking around again he said
And he took another drag of his cigarette. (Cho.)

3. I was going across the corner, I was going against the light
Which had just turned green when up comes some guy
Says don't you know that's a federal offense
Seems like kids your age just ain't got no sense
Don't you know your're risking juvenile arrest
Committing suicide is punishable by death.

4. I was sitting on a park bench, reader's digest in my hand
When down next to me sits a liberal looking man
Who says you're a cute chick I believe in being free
I swung at him with my pocketbook, don't get natural around me
He took out a badge, put some handcuffs on my hand
You're carrying a weapon, self defense be damned. (Cho.)

EVEN the songs the young
sing for fun have little fun in
them, but are mostly tragic,
bitter, angry, defiant. They
seem to sing them, as they do
most things that they do of
their own choice, as a way of
shaking their fists under the
noses of their elders. No fad
is more sure to succeed among
the young than one they think
the adults won't like.

"Let's make this clear: an adult
is someone over 21 -- some of
my best friends are adults. Then
a grown-up is a person of any
age -- over ten like Rockwell,
under ten like Johnson -- who is
too grown to live. This song is
against the grown-ups, not the
adults. After all, being 15, I've
got to live with my parents."
