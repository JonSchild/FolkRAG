Method For Writing Up Notes On Florville Ceromony
(1)

1.  Background
    A.  Family
           1)  circumstances
                  a.  origin
                  b.  evidences of poverty (dress, occupations, etc.)
           2) number of family (approximate)
B.  Reasons for holding ceremony
       1)  general reason; a periodcal mang√© loa held as duty by all
            Haitians
       2)  immediate reason:
             a.  Florville's father owed this debt to the loa; he died
                  without paying it.
             b.  Loa were angry; had already snatched one son; the family
                  frightened.  Cite Revoli's experience with white Petro as
                  example of how frightened they often get.
C.  Preparations
      1) preliminary
          a.)  money saved; 6 dollars asked of Alan.
          b.)  Family gathered in Port-au-Prince
          c.)  Houngon called in (name and something about him)
2)  expenditures
          a.  food (Alan's list):  night before loa called & asked if food
                sufficient; Erzuli said no, it wasn't; she would come.
          b.  money paid Houngon
