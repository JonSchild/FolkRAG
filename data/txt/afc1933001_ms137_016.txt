FOLK SONGS
   The next time you
want some authentic
folksongs, pack some
manuscript in a bag,
put yourself on the
train to Washington, 
D. C., and search out
Mr. John A. Lomax.
Mr. Lomax is full-
time custodian of a 
new section in the 
Music Division of
the Library of Congress.
In this new
section are the records
of 3,000 folksongs
"gleaned from 
the southern mountains,
jungles, prairies,
prisons and
lumber camps."

Transcribed and reviewed by contributors participating in the By The People project at crowd.loc.gov.
