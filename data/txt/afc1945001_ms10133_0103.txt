1. A man once called up his doctor in such an exciting way which made the him
think he or someone in his family was seriously ill. The doctor said he would come over as soon as he had time. But this man who called was so determined he pleaded [[strikethrough]] so [[/strikethrough]] to the extreme, the ? finally said OK.  I'll come over right right away. When the doctor arrived the man said, "Please won't you give my horse a pill so he can eat! Because he hasn't eaten for four days" Upon the disgust of the doctor he turned away.

2. Why did the little moron walk across the street

? like anyone else to get on the other side.

3. The little moron went to a lumber yard and found the Board of Education after looking around he saw a man standing and he said "Young man come and follow me I'll show what board you should be looking. The little ? looking and followed without a word. Finally they came to a board which was the Draft Board. The moron said if I had stuck to the Board of Education I never would have walked into the Draft Board.
