L. Rumor No. 12 was heard in Tulsa, Oklahoma, August 7, 1942.
1. "The reason why we're not getting anywhere in this war is
not so much the lack of supplies as the way we're fightin' it.
We're still fighting by the 1914 rules and methods. The Army
and Navy officials are either unaware of air power or they're
jealous of its potentialities. But in either case it is
equally disastrous for the United States." [*(19)*]
