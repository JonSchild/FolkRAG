your "letter of instruction about certain features
which might cause a little perplexity."
I'll need 'em all, for I doubt that I 
can put the machine together.

I must add that your last undated
letter indicates that you have stopped 
long enough to read my many miscellaneous
and hurried scrawls.  You have covered 
the questions raised therein adequately
and comprehensively and in pleasing detail.
You might in your next send me
"Uncle Herman's" surname, just in 
case.  Also don't forget to tell me 
again the name of the Wiergate Lumber
Co. Negro, or better, return the letter about 
him.  I want to write to him at 
once.

You may have "a month" and more
