My dear Sir:
I have read with interest of the work you are having 
done for the "Archive of American Folk Songs" by Mr. Alan 
Lomax. Such a compilation will be of inestimable value to 
future generations.
I thought you might like to know about my original 
collection of songs entitled "Echoes of the White House", 
a group of thirty-three original melodies composed to poetic 
and prose selections from the writings of the Presidents 
of the United States and First Ladies of the land.
This manuscript has recently been completed after research 
at intervals during the past ten years. I think it 
unique.
At least it is sufficiently novel to warrant a performance 
on April 20th next by the WPA Southern California 
Symphony Orchestra--a ninety-nine piece organization with 
chorus of seventy-five voices. I enclose a list of titles 
with the songs to be given in premier marked in red.
I am wondering if the Library of Congress would care 
to consider recording "Echoes of the White House?" Mr. 
James Sample, conductor of the local symphony, has indicated 
that he would be glad to cooperate in working out a 
plan for recording the collection.
I should be pleased to know your reaction to my suggestion.
Very truly yours,
Maury Madison
