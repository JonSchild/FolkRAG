[*THE FLIGHT FROM THE LIGHT-SKINNED LOVER (CONT. FROM SIDE 1)*]
[*Willard turp. camp*]
TL:        So the guy told you you had five minutes __________?
BJ:        Yeah, an' so, anyway, I got the ticket; I went on; got 
on the train.   An' I met this guy on the train; I told 'im not 
to tell him about him seein' me.   He said, "I sure won't;" said, "If 
you's goin', you go[in]'."  Because they knew how everythin' was 
with me an' everythin'.  Knew how crazy Willard act, an' jealous 
an' foolish he was.   An' so, anyway, they was glad for me to 
go.
           An' I went on to West Green -- to Douglas, Georgia.
When I got off at Douglas, I didn' know the way to the other 
depot, by bein' green an' not knowin' how to travel.   I seed 
these two white womens; I heard them speak an' say, "Well, 
le's go over to the Georgia          Depot."    I tol' myself, 
I said, I'm gonna follow them.   So, ha, I went on [an'] to follow 
them.   When they got into the Georgia          Depot, then, 
there it was, really.   An' I wen' on to the sittin' room at 
the colored  side an' I stayed 'till the window heist -- the 
ticket window -- an' I asked the man for a ticket to Wes' 
Green, an' he says, "The train don't leave till ten o'clock."  
Ha, ha.   Man, I was ready to              my heart       . 
I [went] wanted to leave right then, 'cause it look like Willard 
was gonna miss me an' he gonna come down there (nohow!) 
I was jus' scared.   An' ah, not that he had ever done all these 
things to me; I jus' didn' like the cruel act he had; the ruley 
act; you know, papa act; an' everybody jus' 'cuse you; an' all 
that naggin'; I wasn' use to that.   So I jus' couldn't [take] stick 
it.   So, anyway, I sit there until about nine sumpin'.   Then 
here had come a crowd of colored peoples comin' in.   An' they 
was rough 'uns; they was cutaways (cutups)    , y'know.  'Cause 
they was            people.  An' they was a rough 
kind;  they                                            .   An' so, ah, 
I looked at 'em; I was sittin' in there; I looked at 'em.   An' 
they was real rough.   They was cussin' an' talkin' an drinkin' 
an' everything else; they jus' havin' theyselves some fun to 
theyselves.   I thought that was so rough to me.   So finally, one 
lady told her husban', said, "I's get you when you get in Wes' 
Green!"   An' I know then -- I said, Ah, I know where Wes' Green 
at!   An' I say to myself, I'm gonna get off there with her.
