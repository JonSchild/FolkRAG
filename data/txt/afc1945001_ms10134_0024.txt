Yesterday in the treasurer's 
office where I work I heard a
discussion on shoe rationing. One
of the ladies said "I went over
to the shoe maker on Georgia Ave.
and he had a sign in his window
which said, "no more shoes repaired
until March 1st. In answer a man
said, "it is that way all over Wash.
at most shoe repair shops. Another
lady said, what with shoes
rationed to three prs. a yr. and 
shoe repair place not able to fix
shoes our next steps will be to go
around bear footed.
