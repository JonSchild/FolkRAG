A. Dan Killian, Jr., Esq.    -2-        December 11, 1961
domain material, receive their share of royalty as performers
and arrangers.
I am a scholar and a writer and, as a folklorist, have an enormous
number of friends from all classes up and down the country.
It makes me feel extremely bad that Mr. Rahmings has taken this
plan to publish these recordings as an unfriendly act on my part.
I felt that the motion picture in which he was seen and the recordings
on which he was heard might possibly be of great help
to him.  What every artist need is  a chance to be seen and 
heard.  The money available for such things is not ever the
real point.
For all these reasons I would be glad to increase Mr. Rahmings'
fee somewhat, paying him out of my own fee so that he will feel
better about the whole thing.
To recapitulate briefly a couple of points in this already
overlong letter:  (1)  The two songs in which Mr. Rahmings performed
the leader's part will not be published and the tapes
can be returned if you like.  (2)  He played the part of a 
"side man" on the songs which I hope to release through Prestige
and was offered a side man's Union scale fee.  (3)  I
notified him about publication several months prior to the release
of the records, which won't be out until spring, as I
had agreed to do in my note to him.  (4)  I think we can settle
upon some increase in the fee within the limits of the project,
itself, and if you would like, one of the two of us can prepare
a contract form for his signature.
Sincerely yours.
