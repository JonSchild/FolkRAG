12.
She took me to a house of fame,
She asked me there what was my name,
And loud for supper she did call.
She said, "Old man, you will pay for all."
I was up to the rigs, down to the jigs,
Up to the rigs of London town.

Now supper being over, the table cleared,
She called me her jewel, then her dear;
The chamber maids prepared for bed,
The waiters brought in white an' red,
I was up to the rigs, down to the jigs,
Up to the rigs of London town.

Now it was the hour 'twixt one an' two,
She asked me if to bed I'd go,
An' so very soon I gave consent
And straightway to my bed I went.
I was up to rigs, down to the jigs,
Up to the rigs of London town.

Now she thought by me she'd work her will.
Times she frisked, I lay still.
And as soon as she had got to sleep
Out of bed I gently creep.
I was up to the rigs, down to the jigs,
Up to the rigs of London town.
