One of the boys jumped up and said, "Man go on about your
business; here you trying to show us the way to heaven, and
you don't even know how to get to the Post Office." 8.
Another story is that:
A little boy was plowing cotton. The field that he was
plowing was fenced in with a road running along the fence.
He was plowing with an awful mule. It wasn't long before
the preacher came along the road, and he heard the little
boy cursing the mule.
He said, "Son, can't you plow that mule without cursing
 him?"
The little boy said, "Naw, and you can't either."
The preacher said, "Well you get over the fence and stand
where I am, and I'll show you I'll plow this mule without
cursing." The preacher started plowing, calling the mule a
crazy rascal. And when he came back to the end of the row,
he said, "I plowed that mule and didn't cuss him."
The little boy said, "Yah, but you told so many lies about
him."
Then the preacher asked him, "There ain't much between you
and a fool is there?"
The little boy said, "Naw sir, nothing but a wire fence." 9.
Another story has this to say:
One night a preacher was walking across a bottom, and a
bear saw him. And by the time he saw the bear, the
preacher started running. He ran and ran until he got to
a hill, and finally set down on a stump. Then he took his
hat and went to fanning.
He said, "Whew! God was all right just as long as it was
just me in that bottom, but he wasn't worth a damn in a bear
fight." 10.
The words to one of the songs in this area depict the same
attitude. It is reported that the children objected to the use
of the word "nigger" in a song, so the word "nigger" was changed
to "preacher."
