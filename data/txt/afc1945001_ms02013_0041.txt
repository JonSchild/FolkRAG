that there are too many Jews on Supreme Court and in other branches of
Government.  More well-to-do people are becoming critical of the number
of Jewish people in the Government.  Fear of Government repudiation of
debts in post-war period is slowly but definitely growing.

COLORADO

Rumors are at peak and are impossible to track
down to their source.  Whispers of sabotage and
fifth column work are rampart.  Rumors appear that men with influential
connections besides necessary requirements can more easily procure commissions
in armed forces than those without any connections.  President
Roosevelt's warning against repetition of rumors has been widely acclaimed
on all sides.

CONNECTICUT

Rumors are increasing and State Council of Defense
plans to expose ultimate dangers of such false reports
and will urge necessity for full cooperation in stopping spread of such
rumors.  Reports to effect that surprise blackouts are to be expected
on certain evenings are quite prevalent.

FLORIDA

One rumor appearing is that "the President is
jealous of General MacArthur as a future political
opponent, and that he was being sacrificed on Bataan to eliminate him
as such a menace."  Subsequent developments have effectually squelched
this rumor.  Enemy propaganda is being counteracted in Manatee County 
where 500 members of the Florida defense force are being given special
instruction upon recognizing and refuting rumors and false statements.

GEORGIA

Most persistent rumor is one regarding a letter
received from an American prisoner in Japan who
alleged, under the stamp, that his tongue had been cut out.

IDAHO

Most widely circulated rumor was that Pearl Habor
damage was minimized, that the bulk of Pacific fleet
was destroyed, and hinted at disloyalty of high officials.  This topic is
being dissipated.  Sources of rumor are probably letters written just
after the first attack, talk of return sailors and civilian workers, and
sheer invention.  MacArthur's arrival in Australia has served to rid the
State of such rumors and whisperings.  Labor racketeering stories have
such themes as:  Walking delegates hold workers down to union production
limits; enforcement of craft rules such as refusal of carpenters to
pull and electric switch and demanding that a full-time electrician be
employed to do it; initiation fees raised up to as high as $300; dropping
of many after they have worked out initiation fees and hiring new ones
for the same purpose; sharp dealing by labor in applying concessions
on double time for holidays.  Administration is accused of playing
politics with labor, which is said to be leading us down France's road.
Labor leaders ascribe them to employers and to editors catering to
advertisers.  Public regards them as facts.  Failure of small industries
to get war contracts given strength to tales of big industries' greed
and contracts secured by dollar-a-year executives.  Labor uses these rumors
