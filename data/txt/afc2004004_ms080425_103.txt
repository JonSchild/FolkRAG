Time Code: Tape: #232 (#231 not transcribed - no talking) S. HARP 6

Roll 232
...
The one thing that we haven't been able to see as strangers is the square 
and the parts around it hand how people feel in the square, so why don't you 
take the cameraman through it...

Sacred Harp singers set in a hollow square because they're singin' for 
their own enjoy, they're singin' where each part can hear one another. If 
they were in a big choirloft the bass couldn't hear the treble, or the treble 
couldn't hear the alto. But here, they're settin' in the hollow square, the 
tenor is facin' the alto, the treble is facin' the bass--and here the sound 
goes to the middle.

...       a little slower ... 

In the square, the leader stands in the middle of the square and faces 
the tenor, the melody of the song.  And always to the left is the treble--
this is the treble section. Always to the right of a leader is bass. And 
always directly behind the leader is the alto. And this way the sound all 
comes to the middle, and the leader can get the full benefit of the sound 
comin' to the middle. Now we'll sing, let the tenor sing    ....
on this song. 145. Just the tenor.

I just keep tryin'. I been tryin' now, oh, 'bout 50 years  ...
in between, but I guess it's somethin' kind of that's part of the heritage that's 
bred into you--you never get away from it

 Do you like singing school? Do you enjoy it?
Oh, this is my second singing school in a lifetime, and I like it very 
well because I always learn a lot and it does me an awful lot of good.  And 
if there's anything I like better than singin', it's just more of it
