VI

'cause dey couldn't onderstan' what was goin' on. Dey
said, 'We cain't tell what dat man talkin' 'bout, but
hit don't soun' right. We're agin every preacher but
ourselves. We better 'point a committee to question
him.' An' dey s'lected a committee an' dat committee
waded out dere in ol' Jurden an' served a writ on ol' 
man John.
"but ol' man John caught on fire wid salvation dat mornin'.
He shouted, "Oh, you vipers,
Dere's one mightier dan you
Goin' to come here today.
He's a battle-axe in de time of war,
He's bread when you is hongry,
He'll fight all our battles,
An' conquer our enemies.'
Jesus got word of hit way over in Gallilee.
Slipped on his walkin' shoes dat mornin',
an' walked 72 miles to de baptizin'.
Some theelogians claim dat dis couldn't be.
Can't no man walk so far in one day.
Well, I don't know about dat, but I do know dis.
He lef' home dat mornin' an' got to de meetin' on time.
He tol' ol' man John, 'John, baptize me.'
Ol' John refused; said, 'I ain't worthy to do it.'
But jesus got low an' humbled hisself dat mornin'.
'Hit's writ in de Book, John, though must baptize me.
