BJ TAPE 11, p. 41

"I ain't goin' nowhere." An' that time she put 'er arms
around me. You know? An' I didn't think about it. If she'd a-been
a, a real fighter, a real -- she could a-kilt me. When
she put 'er arms around me on this side, I felt sumpin' stuck 
me. 
I said, "This woman got a knife." She...! Hah, didn't
even know it! A switch blade prob'...An's (and it is) in
this side. I said, "This woman got a knife." So that time I
caught the hand then, caught 'er wrist. I brought 'er wrist
back on around.
And ah, an' Clara said, "Got a knife?!" Clara started out
with the cane.
I said, "Uh-uh. Clara, don't hit 'er." Hah, you know! I
had to beg that way. I said, then, an' 'er -- and um, an'
Arizona say, "What in the devil you come to my do' wit' a knife?!"
An' "That somebody."
An' so I said, "Don't say nothin' to 'er. Now, don't hit
'er, neither."
An' she wasn' sayin' a word. An' that time...See, I had this
hand -- she caught the [hold] whole holt a my chin. Ya see, what, you,
I show it to you sometime. The whole ring in there now. She
caught that holt, in 'er mout'. Well, she caught the chin an'
I know, I had to break the knife out. So I put the hand up in
the door an' bent 'er hand over that way. Pardner, that woman
had a death holt on that knife! She was small in behind, that
knife was helt. But I had one on her wrist. She wasn't no use in the
worl' to come back with it. An' I jus' took an' bent it over, an'
bent the hand over an' broke the, broke the blade out, ya see?
