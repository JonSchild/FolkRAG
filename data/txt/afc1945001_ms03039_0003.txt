Mr. William H. Webber

Dear Mr. Webber:
Complying with your request of October 1, our third
Rumor Report is enclosed. In my opinion, this particular attempt
was not so satisfactory as the two previous reports. There are many
reasons for this....In the first place, the time allowed for this
assignment was entirely too short.....in the next place, people seem
unwilling to cooperate to the extent they will gladly tell you what
they hear and all about it, but they are so busy they do not like
to be asked to write or keep account themselves of what they hear.
One detective and two policemen, for instance, were contacted
and while all three said they would like to be of assistance, they did
not wish to take the time to write down what they heard in the way of
rumors. The truth of the matter seems to be that people are indisposed,
and in my opinion, the best way to obtain rumors is by going after them
yourself, taking the necessary time to mingle with groups and by making
many and varied contacts. This method was very satisfactory with the
first two rumor reports.
With only one exception, each person contacted for this last
report said in effect, "I'll be glad to do whatever I can, but I am so
busy I'd rather just tell you what I have heard, if that will do," and
almost all those cooperating would finally say, "I don't have to sign these or give my name, do I?" All the cooperation received came from
those with whom former contacts had been made, and with whom we were well acquainted. Not one of the three policemen were interested, and it so
happens, we were not acquainted with any of them.
It is believed people would not be willing to repeat this 
assignment if they had to write down their findings and if their names
or signatures were to be used. The local Safety Council working with
the OCD have established their own "rumor clinic" in Omaha and have
