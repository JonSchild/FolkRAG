statement of the plans
of the "Archive" for 1941-1942.
As you are finding out, it
is far easier to set out these
plans and purposes on paper
than it is to carry them [out] through
in reality. [*x*] In any governmental
enterprise, particularly the New
Deal regime, the principle followed
is, "Never do anything today
that it is possible to put
off until tomorrow." I had thought that
the Library - certainly the Music
Division was different. But, alas!!!
You folks on the inside can
only do your darndest, leaving
to us, on the outside looking
in, the business of growling.
