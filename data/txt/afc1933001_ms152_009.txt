Miss J. C. Colcord

New York City

Dear Miss Colcord:

I have handed your letter to Dr. Spivack
and can tell you that the arrangement meets with
his approval and we are going ahead with it.

It will take some time to arrange for the
duplication of the nineteen Maitland records and I
hope by that time you will have located the thirty-eight
commercial records which you can exchange with us.

We're delighted to get the Terry shanty
records and I suggest that you fill out the list
with Calypso records which are difficult to obtain.
With very best regards, I am,

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
