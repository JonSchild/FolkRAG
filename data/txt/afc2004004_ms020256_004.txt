BJ TAPE 42, p. 2 

BJ:    Yeah, uh-huh, mugkups.  An' then she called diffrunt people
by their natchul name, but who they was, we didn't know.  So...
But the mugkups, she said, you know, would be botherin' 'er. 
        Anyway, I made the tea. I fixed the [bad] belt. Nothin' to 
do but jus' fold it up an' put it in a lil' cloth, ya know, 'bout
big enough for 'er waist. Then, ah, I sewed it,  you know, where
it stay in there.      
       An' Pinkey come home with that wood an' Pinkey got in that
yard...ta, ah, oh, it surprised everybody.  [Will] The chillun was behin' 'er
an' [Will...] us, we -- I was in the kitchen; Miz Melton was in the kitchen. 
We heard Pinkey out there hollerin'.  Pinkey throwed the wood
down, ran in the yard an' run up against the wall a the house an'
hollered, said, "Don't kill me, don't kill me! Bessie ain't got 
nothin' on me, Bessie ain't put nothin' on me!"   
        Now, dat's when I got mad!  Did you hear me? I got mad
then.  I didn't care ghost, spirit, hant,nothin' that time.  I 
was mad then.  She run against that wall, outdo's.  Didn't come
in the house an' bring the wood.  Something met her an' told her 
them things!  Ya see, she was messed up with spirits! 
        An' she said, "Don't kill me, don't kill me!  Bessie ain't 
got nothin' on me!   Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh!   Bessie ain't got 
nothin' on me.  Bessie ain't got thing' on me!"  Now, she was
down at that railroad track.  Not a soul home but me an' Miz
Melton.  Miz Melton is in her grave now, an' God knows, if she
live, she tell ya the same thing! 
        I tell ya that thing [hurt me] right now!  I stood in that door; I said,
"I'm gonna do sumpin'; I'm gonna find some body. If I cain't
find, ah, Mr. Singleton, I'm gonna Dr. Bell, or somebody."  Say,
"Dis, dis is too much."
