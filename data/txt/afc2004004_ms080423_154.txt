Tape:    35    R. Hicks & Friends

know, he looked back and he just kep' agoin'.   We didn't see him
for a great long time.
    There was another fella that come in there, and he was terrible
bashful hisself.   And we had these cups,you know, little pitchers,
you know, and it had a leaden top of 'em--you could mash this lead
down and pour the 'llases out.   We call 'em  . . .              you know.
So he's there, and it hadn't got the lead on it good, some of 'em
hadn't, you know, my sister maybe some of 'em, so he took and pushed
his thumb and this let the 'llases out, and when he done that the
whole lead jumped off, poured his whole plate full, poured his
whole plate full, runnin' over, he just jumped up and run.  He couldn't
fool with it, you know, it just made him so bashful, he just took
off, so there's too many 'llases there for him to eat anyhow--
    HP:   That's one of my boyfriends.
    SH:   And that was my sister's boyfriend, you know, there.  And,
and then, uh, we'd have to--when I growed up, you know, and 
acourtin', I had to run the girls down.   And, uh, the woman married, uh,
. . .                            she's embarrassed as hell to [admt it]  . . .
But anyway, the girl and I went to school together, that's where I
got acquainted with her, right, and she walked off of              this
mountain three miles to school and I walked two.   So, uh, she was amilkin'
one mornin', her and her sister was, and a calf was sucklin' a 
cow, you know, and I went down through there, and they was bashful,
[you know,] and they broke and run, run and left the calf sucklin'
the cow, you know, and so[, uh,] I had to get the calf to git him
back to the loft(?), and then I remember her Daddy  . . .
got the calf back in the loft(?), you know, and  . . .
