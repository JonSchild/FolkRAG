Dear Mr. Downes:

I'll be in New York on Saturday and
through Tuesday and I would very much like
to see you Monday if possible so that
perhaps later appointments could be arranged.
I will call your office at that
time. If, by any chance, you can see me
over the week-end, send me a wire and I'll
turn up.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
