Dear Mr. Waters [?]:

Maybe you would work this letter in your file. Down in the country where I was bred and born we would say of coons [?] like this one: "The Man is 'tethered' [?] in his head"   I wish you would tell me what you think of my Southwest Review. According to George's [?] written statement to me he was 13 years old when he came to see me in Austin in 1908 (I lived 100 miles distance), He was carrying the manuscript of Home on the Range and sandwiches. He couldn't print Home on the Range until 22 years later. I back him by twenty years. Now my digression is quite ended.

Sincerely yours,
John Lomax
