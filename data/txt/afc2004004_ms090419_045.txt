So the preacher kept aworryin her, aworryin, worrying, aworryin, you 
know. [He] So she did[n't] tell her [he wanted her] husband.  He say, "[And don't pay any tention to the Reverend.] That's all right.
That’s all right." "Well, you got to do something [it]. I get tired of
Reverend worrying me all the time." [Finally he say] I ain’t studying him," All right.  [We’ll] I'll 
break him up.[“] All right.[“] So this boy sent her off to her mother's,
and told the preacher that he had to go off that Sunday night.  They 
[used] was to have service that Sunday night.  Say, "Reverend," say, "I'm 
got to go off tonight and I can't be at service." Say, "Will you come 
over here and stay [here] with my wife? Will you [come here Sunday night,] don’t [skip] your service tonight & 
come stay with my wife till I come back[, because s]. She's scared?" 
Say, "Why, sho, young man, [I’ll] I'd be glad to." Say, "You know I would." 
Say preacher, "Colored (?) like you,  don’t you know I couldn't afford to turn yo u down?"
Say, "If you got to go off on business [and] something like that, ‘ll be glad [omit]
[be of] service till you come back, [to be] & stay with your wife." 
So the preacher hurried up and went to church, and he got up before [the] his 
people and say, says, "Now I got something to tell you- all I had happen 
to me today." Say, "I didn't know [, but I feel how] that I stood that high [I am] in this community. I didn't 
know that I was trusted that well. I didn't know I was [thought] that much of
[as] a gentleman." Said, "Now [somebody] our young brethering here whom I always put up with 
says he's got to go off now [on] tonight on some special  business and his wife [set] sat home by 
herself and he asked me to come back and stay with her until he come 
back.  And if you [will] all will excuse me now, I would like to go [back] and 
keep the girl company because I know she's afraid there [all] now by herself." 
"All right," they say, "Go ahead, Reverend, go right ahead." [go ahead.”]
 He grabbed his [whip] grip and [off] back to [the] [this boy's] house he went.  [And the old boy up in bed.]
[The] Old preacher on up there and knocked on the door. Said, "Come 
on in, Reverend." The [husband] boy had put on his wife's gown and nightcap. 
"Do you want me to light the lamp, Reverend?" "No, no, no, no. [Don’t] Needn't 
light the lamp." [So he snuggled off in  the corner there the way they] Pulled his clothes off & crawled up in the bed, 
[do. Snuggled in,] took the boy [up] in his arms, pulled him over to him,
