step stoves come out, and she'd shovel off the fire, pile
it up, and put this big skillet, a great big round skillet,
had ridges on it, about 5 or 6 inches long, had a big lid
fit right down on the rim and it had a ear(?) on it and
she'd shovel in that cornbread in there about 3 inches thick,
or four, and put that lid down on it, sits on that fire,
then shovel out the fire and put on top this lid, stack it
up there. The wood embers, put more on, on about 12 o-clock
there'd ba crust on it about an inch thick. Ah, it was sweet
tasting cornbread, and [??] pour out the cornbread
in tin cans, or with a big gourd.  They had gourds, make 
drinking cups out of them or dippers. Pour that out full of
buttermilk, and that cornbread, and have a great big bowl lik
like that full of soft churned butter. And we take out a big 
lot of that hot bread, and ate that and drank that buttermilk.
