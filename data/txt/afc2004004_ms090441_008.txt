world, Reverend Roe does not believe in fighting, but
in "waiting on the Lord."
Where another minister will preach "hell fire
that's so hot the black rows in the congregation will
begin to feel the heat;" or where a Negro bishop will
say, "The CI&O has opened the door and let us colored
folks come in and recognized that we are all laborers 
together with God!"--Reverend Roe says mildly, but with
utter and powerful faith--"And the saints will judge
the nations. The righteous will sit on thrones with
Christ in Jerusalem and they'll judge the world. And
I believe if you've been a man that thought you was
better than me and have mistreated me, you'll be just
as far below me in that day as I am below you now..."
And when Reverend Roe say this in his
quiet and smiling way, it is as if a nation had shouted.
Knowing him, you understand this force, this faith.
Knowing him, you know the so-called Uncle Tom - the "old time" Southern
Negro minister who led his people out of slavery. Knowing the anger of this wild man, you can continue the anger of his people. [I invite] But
now, the step inside the pastor's office and hear him out,
[and I know you will be struck by the Wonder and the 
strangeness of this life, a life that is important to all
of us...]
