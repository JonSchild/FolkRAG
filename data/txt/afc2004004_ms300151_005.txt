[photo caption] A Booming Song From Gus Cannon's Old Banjo

Fame 'Walks Right In' Out Of Cold
By K. W. COOK
The banjo playing of a 79-year old Memphis Negro gave
rise to the song, "Walk Right In," which ranks third in
national popularity this week and which has been in the top
10 for seven weeks.

But while the popularity of his song, written about 1913,
was soaring, Gus Cannon of 1510 Rozelle was shivering
through January's cold wave without coal for his pot-bellied
stove.

Mr. Cannon, bundled in a
soiled sweater and ragged
coat, sat in his rocking chair
strumming his banjo. His soul
was warmed every time his
song was played on the radio.

He strummed and sang along
with it. "Walk right in, sit
right down, baby, let your
mind roll on . . . Baby, there's
a new way of walking, so walk
right in, sit right down, baby, 
let your mind roll on."

But the chill was too much.
Mr. Cannon reluctantly decided
to pawn his banjo for $20 and
buy a ton of coal. That was
a month ago.

Two weeks ago, a music firm
discovered that Mr. Cannon
wrote the song. Last Wednesday 
"two men from New
York" bought Mr. Cannon's
rights to the song for $500 and
one-fourth of all royalties from
the use of the music.

That man from New
York," Mr. Cannon said, "told
me I'd get a check every
month. This is for 20 years
and I can renew it if I want
to."

The rights were bought by
Willard Svanoe and Erik Darling 
- the two men whose
name appears on the record's
label as the song's authors.
Ryerson Music Publishers,
Inc., in New York, also named
on the record label, is a party
to the royalties agreement.

Mr. Svanoe and Mr. Darling
got Mr. Cannon's banjo out of
hock from a Beale Street pawn
shop the day they visited Mr. 
Cannon.

Mr. Cannon's immediate
plans for his money are to get
out of debt and buy another ton
of coal.

Mr. Cannon was born near
Red Bank, Miss. "I was born
on a farm but Red Bank was
my town," he said. "Poppa
sold (tree) bark and brought
me to Memphis one time on top
of a load. I got down on Beale
Street and heard all that stuff
(blues music) going and I
wanted to do it."

He went back home determined 
to be a part of Beale
Street music. He fashioned
himself a banjo from a tin pan
and a guitar neck.

"The neck was too big for
me to get my fingers around,"
he said. "But I taught myself
to play." I was going to get
me a five-string banjo as soon
as I could."

As a young man, Mr. Cannon
lived in levee camps in Mississippi 
and sang as he worked
along the levees. "I played
my banjo and sang all the
time, but I don't remember
what all I did sing."

He left the levee camp to
haul dirt for railroad embankments 
in North Mississippi."I
worked on the Yellow Dog
Road driving a snap mule
team," he said. "I'd sit on
top of a dirt load and sing
about the sun coming up, about
jumping down and sweating."

But the magic beat of Beale
Street kept calling him until
he packed his banjo in a suitcase 
and came to Memphis.
Soon after he got to town, he
composed "Madison Avenue 
Rag."

It tells the story of a banjo
player's first trip to Memphis.
He walks down Madison carrying 
his banjo in a suitcase
and meets a medicine man
who gets him to play the banjo.

The song closely parallels
what Mr. Cannon actually did.
He and Jim Jackson, who
wrote "Kansas City Blues,"
joined medicine shows and 
toured the Mid-South.

"We'd play to get the folks
there. Then the doctor, he'd
sell them medicine," he said.
"We played for different doctors 
and didn't stay with one
too long. We'd join one if he
was going where we wanted
to go."

Mr. Cannon also knew W. C. 
Handy. "One time I was in a
parade with him. He was blind
and we went from the Fairgrounds 
to the airport. It
started raining and I come
back home."

He said he had recorded for
three companies 40 years ago
but "I don't remember what
they was. One of them was
Victor."

He cut a record in 1956 for
Folkways, Inc. The long-playing 
album stands in a corner
of Mr. Cannon's living room.
"I got the record but I ain't
got no machine to play it."

The album's label says the
music is by the Memphis Jug
Band with Gus Cannon. Some
of the songs are "Kansas City
Blues," "Take Your Fingers
Off It," and "Long John Booker, 
Done Gone That Way."

But Mr. Cannon is proudest
of "Walk Right In." "But they
(the Rooftop Singers who
recorded it for Vanguard)
changed some words. They
sing about 'let your hair hang
down' but the song is supposed
to be 'let your mind roll on.'"
Then his wife, Lela, joined
in, "That radio station really
do play that record."
