"ANSWER -- What would the rumormonger suggest? That we're 
so incapable of meeting domestic problems that it would 
be better right now to turn America over to the Japs and 
Germans?" 

Where would we stand if the reader were inclined to say "yes" 
in answer to the last question, or if the reader believed that there might 
be some minor advantages to certain types of change. 

One well-known rumor column started its masthead with the following: 
"Some of the most dangerous, false, rumors now in circulation are examined 
and answered by competent and official authority in the ----------- ------------ today." 
A lead like this implies that the rumors are very dangerous and 
that not all of the most dangerous are being selected for answer. That 
there are others equally dangerous, if not more so, still at at large and 
the citizens must be very alert. We cannot urge too strongly that the need for 
recognizing the relation of rumor to morale in general, and the undesirability 
of increasing anxiety around the focus of material which in large measure 
is innocent. 

The following illustration is fairly good: It deals with a local 
rumor which it answers in specific terms, including giving the reader an 
orientation which will make it possible for him to handle future situa-
tions which might otherwise cast doubt upon the continued truthfulness 
of the current answer. Notice that it does not feel the need to 
encourage this particular response with the official source of the 
informa-
tion, but relies, rather, upon the confidence the people have in the 
column and the newspaper for a fair report.
