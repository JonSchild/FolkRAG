My Dear Mr Lomax:

    Often have I thought of you and your
work with pride and pleasure and it was a delight to
have your letter. It was as brotherly and interest-
ing a letter as I have had. Many thanks.

    Several times during this winter and
Spring I have heard a negro song on the air, sung by
the best of singers and chorus features: "I feel Like a
Motherless Child". I wondered if that isn't the same
song you recorded here and revamped later. It was a
wonderful song.

    It is with regret that I have to say
that Roscoe McLean died here and was buried in the prison
cemetary. He had tuberculosis as you know. Such things
are tragic; he really loved to sing.
  
    Of course I'll pass your letter to Mr
Bates, who is himself a wonderful musician as well as
a first class librarian. He will be glad to hear from
you. When you are in this section, be sure to call on
us. It's always a pleasure to see you and yours.

    With personal regards, I am
    Yours very truly
    L. F. Chapman
