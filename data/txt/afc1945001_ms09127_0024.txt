A Poem from Englewood News. 
A Rhyme 
Lyin in a foxhole
Where minutes seem like years.
Where every now and then a shell
Goes whizzin past your ears. 

You've got to keep real quiet
Watch every bush and tree
Or get your bloomin head blown
off 
By some Jap you didn't see. 

Now it doesn't sound so pleasant
To hear me talk this way 
To you back in your armchair 
Back in the U. S. A. 

I'm not enjoyin this here 
war; 
I want to cut it short; 
And I can end it doggoned
quick. 
If I had your support.
