"Long as I am in de world, I am de light of de world".

"O you see that golden circle 'round de sun".

"They have taken my Lord away and won't tell me where
to find him".

"King Jesus wuz dat stone dat [heaved] hewed out de mountain".

"Where the flowers are bloomin' forever, de sun will
never go down".

"King Jesus was de stone dat come rollin' through Babylon".

"Some come crippled an' some come lame, an' some come
limpin' in my Jesus' name".

"Dis is de way I pray when trouble is in my home".

"When Jesus come you can turn my [head] bed around".

"All my troubles will be over when I lay my burdens down".

"If I never, never see you more, I'm goin' on up de
shiny way".

"In dat great gettin' up mornin' gamblers [goin' to] gonna be
gone".

"Every time my heart was moved, angels in Heaven cried
Lord, Lord".

"Got the mourner stumbling nearly over".

These songs, and others I heard that day, I shall carry
in my heart forever.  And those earnest black-faced boys, dressed
in grisly, gray stripes, who sang them, I shall never forget.  The
reaction from a high pitch of emotional excitement gave me a
sleepless night.  Later, I cam back to the camps at night and made records of the
tunes.

But that day just as the sun went down, I drove home
across the fields, tired and worn from a long exhausting day.
