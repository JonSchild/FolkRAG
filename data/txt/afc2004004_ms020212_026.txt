by the way, is related to the people who set up Williamsburg; he is
a nice guy, warm, and Ted says he has a superlative collection of
field recordings of Negro music which he made on his own in the south
a number of years ago. I am hoping to get better acquainted and hear
them; in any event, he is doing a wonderful job for the singers and
for free.

Corey and Naomi arrive in N.Y. tomorrow night; will call you
Wednesday -- if you are not there, Dina. If you see them, give them
a hug for me; we were in such a damn bind I didn't get to say
goodbye properly, just shovelled them on the bus. I'll write Corey
later care of you.

Love to you and Annie,
Bess
