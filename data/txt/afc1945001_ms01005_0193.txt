             For this study, enlist the cooperation of one representative
of each of the following:
             1.  a dentist
             2.  a policeman who walks a beat
             3.  proprietor or manager of a pharmacy
             4.  proprietor or manager of a bookstore
             5.  a beauty parlor operator

Explain to them precisely what is meant by rumor for the purposes
of this project and the information we want.  Be sure to let them
know that they are to report each repetition of a rumor by a separte
entry.  Secure their promised cooperation for the week of October 5th
through October 9th.  Check with them daily on the progress of their
collection and send the whole collection in to us on Saturday, the 10th.
