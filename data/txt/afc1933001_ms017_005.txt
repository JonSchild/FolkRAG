have been sold second hand batteries
practically worn out. Even at 
this late date you should have
a refund, shouldn't you? My
friends in the Southern Pacific 
organization had enough influence 
to hold the charges
down to the actual cost of
materials used. Again I
report that our built-over machine and
the rejuvenated batteries are now
doing excellent work. At this
time the project goes well. Both
Alan and I, though the heat is in
intense, are in excellent health.

On July 21 I am to be married.
I plan thereafter to make a
trip through New Mexico north
of Taos where I hope to run
down some more of the Frontier
