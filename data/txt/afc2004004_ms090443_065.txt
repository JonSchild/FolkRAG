a chamber maid [tender lady]
& Creesy [Christy] was my woman.
So we was playin to-gether. And me &
Creesy [Cristy] had beat them every game.
He [they] didnt win na'r' a [have a whole] game -- [that]
he didn do nothin but [they had driver that] swell out of that
whole quart of whisky that they had
bought. On [Well] the last games we
had beat them I say [said] -// Hi low
billy, jick, jack [me & baby] and stuffin'//
Me & my baby have played 5 up & you aint
played nothin!// But that guy [we had] was
teed up on the side (*laughs*)
He went up [on] side my head, and I
saw some (of) everything. Had a 45 automatic
on my side. And when I did aim -- come
to my self I was goin on out the
boat & When I started on the boat I guess he
thought I was goin to get a capstan bar for
to hit him with, you know. An Crecesy said,
look out honey, here come Blue it look like he
done pulled out that knife.
He toted a diplo.
I went on up the gang plank--off the
boat--He come on up--"Im [of me] gonna
catch you -- Im gonna kill you--you
