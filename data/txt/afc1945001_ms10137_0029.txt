1. A man's wife said to him,
"I've got something to tell you, Jim,
Since your going to the, my sweet, 
Just remember this to repeat.
It's a song to remember, my Jim
It's 'He waved at a WAVE
and she WAAC ed him.'"

2. A man on a business trip, suddenly though
he would take a short cut. He cut a
cross a desert plain and the body of a
man was lying there. He ran right over
the man. Later when captured he
was why he didn't go around the man. 
He briefly replied, "I couldn't," he said, 
"I only have an "A" card!"
