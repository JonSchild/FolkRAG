Dirty Dozen

Notes taken during renditions of the song:

Two wimmens was jivin' one another... one of 'em want
to make the other one mad, want to make her fight...

Women in kansas City doin' the turkey trot,
Women in Louisiana doin' the Eagle Rock.

Funnies' thing that I ever see,
Pole-cat climbin' up a simmon tree.

You was born in the ditch,
Your head got hitched,
You're a dirty mother-fucker,
You the chief cock-sucker.
