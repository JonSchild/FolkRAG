[Jan 14*]
John T. Lassiter spent the evening with 
me at Port [Bundet?] - a big Texan, over
6 ft., red faced, [Sandburgian?] teeth tobacco
stained; family crown grant in Virginia,
come to Texas when I was 18. Now [???]
fiscal agent of US gov in Haiti. Four years
in Marine Corps in S. Domingo, then for
three years rode Haitian S D border on 
SD ride from sea to sea, hdqts Command-
adore, relays of mules and guards which
he would wear out riding day and night,
slept in hammocks, no net, ponchos - 
remembers 5 marines, butchered with horses
at ford near his hdqts so that you couldn't
tell horse from human flesh, 6th escaped
with loss of 8 fingers and ants all over
him - one day went up a little mountain
trail he didn't know, waltzed around
a curved bench, stepped almost into a
fire around which 6 coco outposts
sat drinking coffee, backs as the bench
widened 18 thatched houses in 3 rows of
six, as big black reached for his two
pearl handled revolvers I shot through
