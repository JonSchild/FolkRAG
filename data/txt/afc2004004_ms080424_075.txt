Time Code:
Tape:  Roll 55  Stan and Hattie  1
Hat:  Now here is a little yolk we used to have to put on little cats
and stuff.
AL:  That's the kind of yoke you'd actually use. . .
Stan:  Yeah, we'd take 'er and catch a couple of cats.  We put the yoke on
'em, (unint) and then we tied their tails together, and then we took a
can of beans, shut 'em up you know to the (unint.), and tie it to the cat's
tail and sett 'em loose.  And there was a hell of a time. . .
Hat:  They couldn't get loose!
Stan:  No way, their tails tied together and this yoke on 'em, they'd scratch
and claw like hell to get out of this, and them beans rattlin'!  And
sometimes dad would give us a pretty bad whoopin' off of it, and I guess
really needed it. . .but that's why they used the little fellers for.
Hat:  And here's a whistle, my daddy made 'em out of what we call meuse(?)
wood.  And when we wanted somebody to come to house to come to dinner we
would blow the whistle, we would.  Once I was out in the woods and I seed
somethin', I was awful afraid, and it looked like a cat comin', its head
cut off.  And I grabbed my little brother and ran to the house.  And
they asked what I seed and I said I didn't know what it was.  My daddy
said it was a pheasant, and it shot its feathers up that way it looked like
her head is cut off.  If I had a whistle I would have blowed it, but I
didn't have it there with me.  (bloes whistle) Got cross-bows and fly
killers and hand bows, and I could just tell ya, on and on. . .
AL:  He'd just slip up in his chimney corner at night, and carve with his
hands.
Hat:  Yeah. . .(unint.) chimney and sit and tell us tales.  He put a back log
on a front stick and put his wood in there and sit and tell tales and 
sing songs for us. . .he'd sit til midnight, before we went to wed!  This
is (unint) I don't know if this is (unint) or not. . . .
