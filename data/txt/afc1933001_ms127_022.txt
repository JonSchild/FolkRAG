Dear Miss Owens,

Your letter, sadly enough, did not reach me until after my return to
Washington from my two months' trip in Kentucky. I am sure I could have
greatly benefited from your help in that region. Themsize of your collection
is, indeed, amazing and I should like to learn more about its nature.
How much of it has been recorded on discs? How much on cylinders? How many of
the tunes are only written down? Forwhat proportion of the songs do you
have the airs? I hope it will be possible for the Library, which is the
natural repository for all folk-song collections I think you will agree,
some day to have the words and texts for all your songs, whether you publish
them or not.

Would it be possible, therefore, for you to give me some information about
your collection?

With best wishes for your future success in the field, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
