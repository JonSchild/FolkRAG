Cowboy Brags

Raised on six-shooters till I got big enough to eat ground shot-guns.

The moans of windows and orphans is music to me melancholy soul.

(Born in the Rocky Mountains, suckled by a grizzly bear.
(Ninety-nine rows of jaw teeth and not a single hair.

Thirty-two inches between the eyes and they feed me with a shovel.

Mount the wild ass and jump from crag to crag.

Shoulder 500 bushel of shot and walk through solid rock up to my knees.

Any man don't believe it I'll lick him on a sheep hide and never tromp
on the tail.

I'll snatch him bald-headed and spit on the place where the hair came off.

Take a leg off and beat him with the bloody end of it.

Slap his head up to a peak and then knock peak off.

Take his eye out and eat it for a grape.

I'm mean enough to step on little chickens, pull up young corn, kick
widow woman's dog into the crick.
