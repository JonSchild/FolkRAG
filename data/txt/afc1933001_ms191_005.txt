Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt
Livingston, Ala.

Dear Mrs. Tartt:

Since you wrote me last I have been on vacation. While
I was gone Mr. Lomax wrote to Dr. Spivacke urging him to take
steps to clear your WPA folklore manuscripts. Accordingly, with 
the permission of the Librarian, we are sending you herewith 
41 manuscripts, including everything we could find of yours, on
a two months' loan. I am glad that this has been made possible
and hope that you will be able to make good use of the material. 

I am also returning the letter from Mr. Lomax which I
failed to enclose the last time. We are glad to hear the Dock
Reed and Vera Hall are pleased with their checks.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
