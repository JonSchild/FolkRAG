Jealous Husband, Old Zip Coon,
Haste to the Wedding (dance & tune, [from?]
Sicilian Circle too)-"you can get them 
all out of a book, tunes, calls, and 
all--" his wife went off upstairs to 
find the book but of course it was 
gone--tell HHF about it--
No courtin'-had a dance [every 
twice a we] every Fri nite in
[the] winter, commencing in the
fall, keeping up thru winter until
sleighing broke up in the spring--
had suppers in the corn husking--
beans, brownbread, [& coffe] punkin
pie & apple pie, new cider, cake
dougnuts--those times are 
gone
