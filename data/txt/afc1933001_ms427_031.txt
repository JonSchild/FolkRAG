HOLD THE FORT

We meet today in Feedom's cause,
And raise our voices high;
We'll join our hands in union strong,
To battle or to die.

Chorus: Hold the fort for we are coming--
Union men, be strong,
Side by side we battle onward,
Victory will come.

See our members still increasing;
Hear the bugle blow.
By our union we shall triumph
Over every foe.

Chorus:

Look, my comrades, see the Union
Banners waving high,
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh.

Chorus:

Fierce and long the battle rages,
But we will not fear
Help will come whenever needed,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer.

Chorus:


NATIONS COME AND JOIN US

(Manuscript - Obtainable from Affiliated Schools - 5Â¢)

Nations come and join us
Not with swords or muskets
But with arms and souls of peace.
Side by side march onward,
Life your voices upward
Till the reign of war shall cease.
Clear the weeping and the swearing feild.
Plant it with a peaceful seed to yield
A people strong and friendly
To build a land of plenty
Bot for one, but all for all.
