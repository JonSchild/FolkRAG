Received your card today
seen Charlie that evening. he had forgot
about us being with him at all. so
made the Bows my self droped one and
bursted it. Made the smallist one for Charley
but decided to send the Four to you.
you might cut both ends off the same and it
might be better: the other long one might
be to long. if so cut it off at each end
the oak one in my opinion should be
the best one. the timber I got to make them
of was realy to young: the smallist one of
the cedars might be the best: it is out of a
diferent Piece of cedar that is older
dont try to Bend them to much.
Just enough to get the string as tight
as you want it: you might put tape
around the end where you have the Key
hope you both a lot of good luck
