this righthere is red......, this here.... poke salad, you
seen a poke salad, haven't you? Poke salad's the best type
of a thing......grown up too big, but when it's young.....
.....when it's just so high, you pick that when it's about
that hard, that's old, got red berries on it. You take it
when it's little that's tough, off like this, when it's
young, bout that high, and about that big around, roll it
in flour and meal, put some pepper on it, put it in the
pan and fry it, and it's like a fish, just like fish......
