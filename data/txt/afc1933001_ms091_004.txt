Dear Ruby, 
Ive been thinking 
of you each day, and 
meant to write again.
you know where good intentions
lead? I have been 
working on the sale of tickets
to the Style Show which has 
been hard this year on account
of so many other drives for
money that preceeded our sale.
The Show will be Feb..17 - I'll 
give you a ticket if you come 
down.

I handed in Kathy Blands
name to model. She was asked 
and I think they are all secretly
pleased but say nothing. Only 
freshman girls were asked, 
to be debutontes. I though K
was eligible since she has 
a nice figure, is a freshman
& Sister M - says she made 5 
A's the last semester.

Judith wrote me, Wednesday
the letter came, that John had 
been in bed 5 days from flu.
Heis work has been heavier
since the first of the year.
