BJ:    First I left Miami in '28.  I went on the Gulf of Mexico, down
on [Cobanje Cayah place (sp?)] Barrangee-Collier.  You know, [Cayah] Collier County?  Well, anyway,
that's where I went to, [Mc]Collier [?] County.
AL:    Was that some other job?
BJ:    That was some other job.
AL:    What kind of job was that?
BJ:    Well, that was just workin' ov' there in the clam factories.
AL:    Clam factories!  What was the name of the town?
BJ:    The name of the town was [Macoe (?)] Marko.   You go across over to Marko,
[Macoe and] across on the ferry.  And [catch salmon] Keksama.  See, that's his place.
Barrangee Place, supposed to be two men:  Barrangee and then Collier.

AL:    That's  in [Fla] Alabama?
BJ:    No, that's in Florida.  About 91 miles a' (from) Cuba...It's near
Everglade City, on the other side of Everglade City.
AL:    On the Gulf?
BJ:    Tha's right; thas' right.  Right on the gulf  
AL:    How'd you happen to...
BJ:    Nothin' happen to me; I went down there and I worked down there...
AL:    I mean, how'd you happen to leave this lady?
BJ:    Well, the tide (?) went down and they went back to Ticta (?).
AL:    Then they decided to go back to Key West?
BJ:    Thas right.  Went down there, heard talk of this work down there.
Went down there, on the Gulf they called it; went down to Marko and
Keksama.  We worked down there at this clam factory.
AL:    Did Claire go with you?
BJ:    Oh no, no.  Claire had married then.  She was still back down
on the Keys -- down on the home state side.  And when I got back she
lived the Miami side.  [She had marrie] She had married, see.
AL:    She was livin' in the truck patches then?
BJ:    Yeah, thas right.  She was workin' for the truck people.
AL:    And you went down and worked in [the...] this clam factory.
BJ:    Thas right.
AL:    That must have been exciting.down there in Key West.
BJ:    [Thas Right.]  Oh, oh.  It wasn't Key West , though.  It was the 
various islands.
AL:    Very close.
