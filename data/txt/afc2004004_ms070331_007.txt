RED IRON ORE
We went through North Passage--oh, Lord, how it blew!
And all 'round the Dummy a large fleet there came, too;
The night being dark, Old Nick it would scare.
We hove up next morning and for Cleveland did steer.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

Now the Roberts is in Cleveland, made fast stem and stern,
And over the bottle we'll spin a big yarn,
But Captain Harvey Shannon had ought to stand treat
For getting into Cleveland ahead of the fleet.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.

Now my song is ended, I hope you won't laugh,
Our dunnage is packed and all hands are paid off;
Here is health to the Roberts, she's staunch, strong and true,
Not forgotten the bold boys who comprise her crew.
Derry Down, Down, Down, Derry Down.
