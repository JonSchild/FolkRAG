You Don' Know My Min' 

learned in 1921 

Ask my baby could she stand to see me cry? 
Tole me, "Sweet papa, I could stand to see you die." 

Two kinds o'nations I don't understand-- 
That's a Dago woman an' a Chinese man. 

Ten dollars won' get a woman, let her go
'Cause she ain't no better than no other whore. 

If you wanta see a whora grin,
Change a dollar an' give her ten. 

Change a dollar an' give her ten--
"Money, daddy, was made to spen'." 

When you see me laughin' to keep from cryin', 
Woman I love stays on my min'.
