Attached is a letter from The University of
New Mexico describing their plans to establish an
archive of New Mexico.  Since it has always been the
Library's policy to encourage such local archives and
assist them in every way possible, I recommend that
the Library furnish Mr. Campa with records and needles
which he needs on the condition that the Library get
copies of all records so obtained.  The total cost,
including the records and needles needed for the
Library's copies, should not exceed $300 and should be
charged to Increase.
