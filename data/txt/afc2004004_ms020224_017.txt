didn' know he was comin' an' so Mama an' them was over town to
a big show, you know, these big shows?  An' they always [sat] sell on
the street when the big shows come.  An' put a table?  Peoples
allow 'em to have tables an' they sell.  An' they make money
that way.  It he'ped, he'ped the farmers out.  An' so Mama said
she told, when me an' Sister went over town -- the girl that I called
Sister I was raised up with, ah, she, she one of the Carter
girls -- me an' her went over town.  After we get through sweepin'
the yards an' cleanin' up with what we had to do home, then we
can go, see?  As I tol' ya before, I never stayed far from town,
in my life, 'cause we walk on over there.
     An' we was walkin' an run 'till we got to town.  See, Mama
put my clo'es out, ya know, for me?  An' I put 'em on after I
got through.  An' ah, we ran over town, an' ah. . .I'll never forget.
I was nine years old then.  An' ah, we got over there.  Just as
we got there, Mama said, "Run down to the train,"  Said, she said,
"Roney is here," and said, "He come to see you.  But he's got to
go back."  He worked on some kinda, ah, ah, work, an' he had to
be back home.  And, an' ah, so, some kinda big work.
TL:  Roney's your daddy?
BJ:  Huh?  Yeah, Roney's my daddy.  An' so, an' me an' Sister
run, oh we run down to the depot.  Jist as we got there the
train was pullin' off an' the people was ah, was wavin', so I
don't know whether he seed me outa that winda or not, but he
wouldn't a-knowed me, nohow, 'cause I was a baby.  He hadn't
never seed me, nohow.  An' ah, so, he, he, he wouldn't a-knowed me.
     But I just say, that I come just that near to seein' him.  Ha, ha.
An' ah, this heavy work -- What's that kinda work he was on?
Anyhow, I heard 'em say that he left there with that work.  You
