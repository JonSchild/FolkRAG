Mr. John A. Lomax  May 26, 1938

such prejudice, other folk-lorists have been jealous
of you because of the commercial success of your books, 
and he, along with the others, felt that you and I were
trying to hog the whole field of American folk song. 
Herzog objected to that on purely scholastic grounds, 
of course.

No. 2: Miss Knott of North Carolina gave a mildly successful
folk festival in Washington the first part of
this month. It was the usual uncritical hash of everything
you can think of and Miss Knott played her ordinary
dumb but beautiful role, sweeping across the stage in a
long white lace dress and pushing folk singers around like 
a professional checker player. All the folk-lorists, from
Miss Beckwith on down, spent their time in the lobby wishing
that folk festivals had never been heard of; there is
a movement on foot to attempt to depose or at lease demote
Miss Knott.

I locked horns again with Colonel Pickering and I am afraid
it was only my official position and his extreme age and
fragility that restrained me from letting him have it. If
I get my chance in New York, I think that this wen, the 
National Folk Festival, may be carved off the name of American
folk song.

No. 3: Waters tells me all the copy on Cowboy Songs is
done and Mr. Putnam told me only ten days ago that they
expected to publish the volume in August. I am a little
nervous about the textual side of the book, since Waters
has refused to take any responsibility for it and I have
not had a minute to look it over, myself.

No. 4: The Schultz matter seems to be well shelved. U.F
W.A. put its pressure on at the proper moment and that
seems to have been all that was additionally necessary to 
kill the matter for the time being.

I am delighted to receive you into the stuffed shirt bosom
of Phi Beta Kappa. The stupid part of this is that you
were not a member years and years ago, because if anybody
deserved to be made a member, you did. You shouldn't be
afraid of a little grand feeling on the subject, because
the Lomaxes, in keeping with the rest of humanity, are a
vain race. 

Please write me as much as you can about Austria, Switzerland, 
etc. You mention them as casually as though they
were just other corn-fed counties in the Mid-West.
