Reel 30 No 1
Soft hailstones in yonder well
The poor shepherd in the shelter
of the knolls.
His stick under his chest
and his broach in his Brest
and he imploring God to
make drout an sunshine
30/5
Bring down the bottle & put
this drink around. Fill the
vessel & keep it steady. A
toast to the colonel of the
feast with whom every
victory succeeds. The air of 
Knoidart of the trees
and glengarry to the North.
Allen McDougal [Donald]
Sung to his chief
