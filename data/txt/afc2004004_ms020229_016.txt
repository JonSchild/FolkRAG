colored people. An' he hit 'im. Hit 'im the back of his neck,
ya see. An' struck 'im well. He had to stagger [to] an' tote the
thing; a colored boy hope (helped), hope 'im up with it. Jus'
like, jus' like Christ's resurrection. (HERE HER VOICE BECOMES 
LOW WITH A QUALITY ALMOST OF VENGENCE). Do you ever see anything 
like it in your life!  An' so, an'ah, an' when that -- When, when, when they call
that Ethop'an to tote the cross, to he'p Him tote the cross up
the, up the hill?
An' so , hit jus' ah, hit jus' ah, it just be everything in 
the past -- It have to happen that way. To intepetate Jesus.
An' up home they said a while ago, they's gonna take
blood to take anything that Christ wants ta do -- that He brought
back natchully. It was -- What I start to say a while ago, when
Adam an' Eve sinned, ahm, He took a -- ah, ya see what, ah, he,
he did to that boy? His own brother, turn against' him. He could,
God coulda made him not turn against 'im. But jealousry what
he turn against for, see? Hatred! An' jealousry. (jealousy)
'Cause when he burn, ah, when not seein', as you say a while ago 'bout
the peoples. If they would come to they self, an' see where they 
wrong, then they would, they, ah, would, you know, all go one
way.

AL: Now, do you think all those crackers who carry on that
kinda stuff are in trouble for their eternal souls?
BJ: They, they in trouble 'lessen they git forgiven. You know
Jesus [try to] Christ forgive those men, said, um, been all of 'em...ah, 
he askted God, too, to forgive them "'cause they know not what
they done." See? Jesus [cry an'] Christ say He forgive 'em at, at the
cross.
