August 4 - From a highly respected Omaha real estate dealer: "many
people I meet are confused and are becoming depressed because we are losing the
war to date. Men who, heretofore, have been hopeful and optimistic, for the
first time are expressing fear for our future. They know we were miserably un-
prepared, and that it takes time to get on our feet, but they also feel there is
too much confusion in Washington among those in the Army and also the Administration.
There is a growing impatience about this...I hear it everyday."  13
