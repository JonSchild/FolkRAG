I shall investigate the possibility of getting you blank discs for
your transcription work. As you know, it is impossible now to get acetate
records on aluminum bases. Have you considered the possibility of using
records on cardboard bases? These are fairly satisfactory on some types
of recording turntables. Will you please let me know whether you use 12-inch
or 16-inch turntables?

We should be delighted to receive the transcriptions which you are
making for distribution among the stations even if they have run the complete
circuit. I notice that you say something about re-recording. Would it be
possible for you to send them to us for permanent deposit? Or do you have to
have them up there for future reference? If you will send me all this
information, I believe that it may be possible for me to work out some joint
project with the Library of Congress whereby we could supply certain of the
materials in return for the completed recordings.

I want to thank you for sending me "The Aleutian". I have read each
issue with the greatest of interest and want to congratulate you on a 
splendid job. It is amazing to me how you get it out.

The composing contest of which I spoke in a previous letter is making
steady but slow progress. If they are finally approved by the War and Navy
Departments (they have already received preliminary approvals), you will
of course receive the rules and official notification through channels. I
shall remember your interest, however, and see that you are notified as soon
as the thing gets under way.

Again let me thank you for your splendid efforts in this experiment
with folk music and assure you that the report which you send me is really
valuable to me not only for my work with the Joint Army and Navy Committee
but also for my work in the Library of Congress. Frank Keppel and all your
friends in the Pentagon Building join me in sending you our kindest regards.

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Music Adviser
