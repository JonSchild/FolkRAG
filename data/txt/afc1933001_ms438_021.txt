The Maid Saved from the Gallows
(Mama, Did you Bring Me Any Silvo?)
Lead Belly learned th[e]is    Child ballad form Margaret, a girl
with home he grew up in the country near Mooringsport*.  Her
version, as she now remembers it,  is presented below.   The reader
will notice that the usual conclusion,  where the victim is rescued
by the sweetheart,  has disappeared. 
"Mama,  did you bring me any silver?
Mama, did you bring me any gold?
What did you bring me,  dear mother,
To keep me from the gallow's pole?"
"Son,  I didn't bring you any silver,
Son I didn't bring you any silver,
I just come here to see you
Hang on the gallow's pole."
[Scribbled out] This is the way Lead Belly remembers it.  The aunt has become the villian. 
"Mother, did you bring me any silvo?
Mother,  did you bring me any gold?
What did you bring me,  dear mother,
To keep me from the gallis-pole?"
"Son,  I brought you some silvo,
Son, I brought you some gold,
Son'  I brought you li'l' ev'ything
To keep you from de gallis-pole."
