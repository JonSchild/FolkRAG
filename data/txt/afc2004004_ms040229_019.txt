Only the old well remained and as
she stooped doon with a nameless
(por?) upon her to pluck some of its, 
watercress, she saw one like unto a 
man passing by, (?)  With a cry she 
rushed after the only one of her people
who seemed to be left- "Brother, brother
is it leaving me thou art? And again
she cried brother "Are there only two
of us now left?" And the other
wanderer turned and in his hands and feet (were?) the 
marks of nails.
