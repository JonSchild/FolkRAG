[**Star Spangled Banner**]

In His Musical Memoirs (1830, Vol. I, pp. 80-84) W.T. Parks
entered under the year 1786 these entertaining lines:

This season I became an honorary member of the Anacreontic Society,
and at the first meeting played a concerto on the oboe, as did Cramer
on the violin. The assemblage of subscribers was as usual very numerous,
amongst whom were several noblemen and gentlemen of the first distinction.
Sir Richard Hankey (the banker) was the chairman. This fashionable
society consisted of a limited number of members, each of whom had the
privilege of introducing a friend, for which he paid his subscription
accordingly. The meetings were held in the great ballroom of the
Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand, once a fortnight during the season,
and the entertainments of the evening consisted of a ground concert, in
which all the flower of the musical profession assisted as honorary 
members. After the concert an elegant supper was served up; and when 
the cloth was removed, the constitutional song, beginning, "To Anacreon 
in Heaven", was sung by the chairman or his deputy. This was followed
by songs in all the varied styles, by theatrical singers and the 
members, and catches and glees were given by some of the first 
vocalists in the kingdom. The late chairman, Mr. Mulso possessed
a good tenor voice, and sang the song alluded to with great effect.....

This society, to become members of which noblemen and gentlemen would
wait a year for a vacancy, was by an act of gallantry brought to a
premature dissolution. The Duchess of Devonshire, the great leader of
the haut ton, having heard the Anacreontic highly extolled, expressed 
a particular wish to some of its members to be permitted to be privately
present to hear the concert, etc., which being made known to the directors,
they caused the elevated orchestra occupied by the musicians at balls
to be fitted up, with a lattice affixed to the front of it, for the
accommodation of her grace and party, so that they could see without
being seen; but some of the comic songs, not being exactly calculated 
for the entertainment of ladies, the singers were restrained; which
displeasing many of the members, they resigned one after another;
and a general meeting being called, the society was dissolved.
