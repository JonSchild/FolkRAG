Terrill planned to turn in her yet
unfinished notes of the last
trip. I don't fail to realize that
if Harold or MacLeish, either or
both of them, really cherished
any great desire to see me
they'd find a way to have
me come on. Meanwhile
we'll wait and see. I'm perfectly
content in the status
quo and have no favors to
ask of either.

I've paid your insurance
bill. Now do you be sure to
put the proper clamps on Aunt
Molly. Remember that such
people (including  Lead Belly) are
victimized by designing and
selfish people looking for a
dollar for themselves.

Miss Terrill says she can have
her notes finished in a month.
