Mr Alan Lomax
Dear Sir, 
I am writing you in regards to 
the singing that was performed by the 
group of inmates at Camp B of which I was 
one of them. All of the others received 
checks for five dollars, and I did not 
receive any. 
I'm certain that there is some reason 
or reasonable answer to this of which I'm sure 
you are able to provide, will you please do 
so at your earliest convenience. 
Very Respectfully Yours, 
Huston Eannes
