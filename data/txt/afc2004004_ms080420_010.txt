Time Code: #2 cont. Tape: APPALACHIA Maggie Valley

Kyle: That's true, it started...Well, the first time that
we know of... the clogging really is a Dutch with a clodhopper.
The Dutch, the Germans, the Scotch-Irish. Ours is a mixture
of all the dances.
AL: But in Europe, they don't clog when they square-dance.
Kyle: No, it's a matter of style and here every community
will have a different style.
AL: But what I mean is the clogging square dance originated
here in this area, recently. It originated in Maggie Valley,
or in Sofo Gap, around there?
Kyle: Yeah, I would credit Sam Queen with some of his
barnyard shuffles, lot of rhythm involved and it's not real
easy to do some of the stuff that Sam Queen does. And it
was a challenge for people, and they learned to love to do
it with the music, and I imagine that you could credit Sam
Queen with most of the type dancing that we do today, in clogging
In 1935, he did a festival in Chatanooga, Tennessee, it was
the first place that I'd seen "Clogging" printed as a word.
Webster says clogging is a rough, noisy, sound and we disagree.
We feel like that if it's done with precision and grace, that
it's an art, and it's beautiful.
AL: It certailnly is the way you all do it. How many dance
teams would you say there are here in this section?
Kyle: I'd say there's 100 teams in Balkam and Hayward Cty.
