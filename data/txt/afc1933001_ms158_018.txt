My dear Mr. Lomax,

There is a remote possibility that the recent grant of a few thousand dollars to further the work in the field of musical research may open up a few minor positions in some branch of your department.  It is with this thought in mind that I am writing to you.

I have recently been graduated from college with my major concentration in music.  This includes besides a broad cultural background, courses in harmony, counterpoint, fugue, history of music, orchestration, conducting, teaching of music, criticism, etc. etc.  My scholastic (and extra curricular) record has been above average.  I feel that I am a capable, industrious worker, and if you so desire references may easily be obtained.

I am especially eager to enter the folk music field and would be delighted to work in the field proper as an apprentice.  If experience in handling recording equipment is a requisite, I think I can fill that requirement also.  However, even if you only have a position open for a transcriber or copyist, I would be very interested to hear about such an opportunity.

Thank you in advance for any trouble to which you may go on my account.  I trust that I may be favored with a reply at your earliest convenience.  

Most sincerely,
Lionel Kaplan
