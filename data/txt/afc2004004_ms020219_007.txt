he was very lazy.  An' ah, an' so an' how jus' couldn't stan' it,
couldn't take it.  He would tell a lie, an' say he sick.  So, for a
long time he, he did that.  So the, the boss man [jus'] thought he
was sick, sho' enough.
           An' Mary, ah, was he wife, ya know.  She was ah; smart, see.
Ya see?   An' she, she worked.   An' she come to the house an' cook
an' go back an' work in the fiel' an' tend to Enoch.   But she

around the house -- he wa'n' actin' like he sick then.
           So, she tol' 'im.   She said that she jus' b'lieve that Enoch
was playin' off.   Said, "I don't know."  So when Enoch -- Said,
"I b'lieve he playin' off."   Well, they didn' [wan'] wan' (want to)
jus' go tell Enoch that, ya know, so they 'cided to study a way
for Enoch to, to find out was he sick or not.
           So they had this great -- They didn' ha' a [big house] bay hoss;
they got a great, big, bay, white hoss from another man, 'way
far from there.   Didn' -- Enoch know he didn' -- That they didn' ha' no white hoss.
