III. Inflation Control-continued

"I can't understand why they ration sugar.  There is plenty of it.  I
think one reason they are rationing sugar is to help keep the price up."
(Birmingham housewife 8/3/42.)

"Gasoline rationing (in buffer areas and States adjoining rationed
States) is being put on because of pressure from the States being
rationed.  It is not necessary but the dealers in the rationed States
don't want gasoline sold in adjoining States without any limits.
(Filing station operator, Birmingham, Aug. 3, 1942.)

"There is already too much low test gasoline.  It is ridiculous to
ration it." (Young machine shop worker, Birmingham, August, 5, 1942.)

"Is it true that the Government is making you sign a pledge that you
won't earn more then a certain amount of money in a year f you live in
a Government housing project." (Wife of defense worker, Birmingham,
August 5, 1942.)

"
"I hear they are going to ration railroad travel next." (City bus
passenger, Birmingham, August 4, 1942.)

"I don't believe there is any rubber shortage.  I saw the other day where
tire dealers said they had enough tires for two years.  I know several 
dealers myself who have thousands of tires and tubes that are frozen.
They can't sell them and they can't get their money back. The government
just makes them keep the tires on their shelves and they rot."
(Contractor, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, August 5, 1942.)
