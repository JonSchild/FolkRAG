like it. I'm nae going to come" and I was in a kind of a 
rage at him. After spending all my energies thinking I
was getting a grand man. "Well, Steward" I said "Please
yourself" and I said "I'm going to gi'e you the best shot
hindmost"..........[that's last].....I said "There's the 
bonniest quean to mak your food and set wi' you the evenings
that ever you saw your life or that ever you will see."
