O LD BLACK JOE
Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay;
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away;
Gone from the earth to a better and I know,
I hear their gentle voices calling "Old Black Joe!"

CHORUS- I'm coming, I'm coing,
For my head is bending low;
I hear their gentle voices calling "Old Black Joe!"

Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain?
Why do I sigh that my friends come not again?
Grieving for forms now departed long ago.
I hear their gentle voices calling, "Old Black Joe!"

CHORUS-
Where are the hearts once so happy and so free?
The children so dear that I held upon my knee?
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go,
I hear their gentle voices calling, "Old Black Joe!" 

CHORUS-

SONG OF THE BUILDERS

We are the builders, we build the future,
The future world is in our hands.
We swing our hammers,we use our weapons
Against our foes--- in many lands.

We are the builders, we build the future
And he who hinders us must fall.
Come join us comrades, our task is mighty,
We need your help--- you workers all.

Each day of struggle, each hour of battle, 
Each blow we strike breaks yokes and chains
From limbs and shoulders, it frees the workers
In city factries, fields and plains.

And we, the workers,who are the builders,
We fight, we do not fear--- to dies.
"All power and freedom unto the workers!"
Is our defiant battle cry.
