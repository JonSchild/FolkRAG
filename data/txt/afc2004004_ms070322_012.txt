Thursday - Last night was the sweetest
I've spent with Robin since I came
to Europe. Whether it was that
I said something in drunkenness
before going to bed [we had a quart
of Vin Ros√© & a good deal of roue]
or the mysterious tides that flow
in Robin, but last night we were
together with the translucent springtime
lightness of flesh that Botticelli
painstts and only lovers ever experience.
When her reserve melted, all the
fears & anxieties of the past weeks
left me and I became the lover
& man that I am capable of being.
All this is awkwardly & pedantically 
said, but it is true.

Took the Citroen to the 
garage - brakes, taillight, body done -
but they turned it back to me
with reccomendations for cylinder
