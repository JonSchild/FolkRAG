Lomax: How does this Smuggler's Boy begin? Just a minute, Peter.
Cox: Well, you know what smugglers (some words lost from tape)
smugglers used to get it over here about. Well, this is how that
happened, you see. Board o' a ship, same as the song'll tell you,

father. I'll sing it to you, then you'll - then you'll see.
One cloudy cold morning, as abroad I did steer,
By a wide rolling ocean, that run swift and clear,
I heard a poor creature, in sorrow did weep,
Saying, "Oh, my poor father, he is lost in the deep.
Oh, pity, I pray thee, oh, give me employ,
All forlorn I must wander," cried a poor smuggler's boy.
"My father and mother once happy did dwell,
In the neat little cottage that reared me so well.
My father did venture all on the salt sea,
For a keg of good brandy, from the land of the free.
From Holland we steered while the thunder did roar,
And the lightning flashing on us, when far, far from the shore.
Our ship's mast and riggin' was blown to the waves,
An' I found my poor father in a watery grave.
So I jumped overboard in the troublesome main
To save my poor father, but all was in vain.
I grasped his cold form and drew it on me,
The form it was lifeless, sank down in the sea.
So I clung to a plank, so then gained the shore
