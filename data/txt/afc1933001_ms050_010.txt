    We propose to furnish a permanent place in the new
Fondren Library for the records, as well as, a machine
in accommodation that will seat two hundred people. We propose
to keep the records under strict supervision, making them available
to those who are granted a permit to use the same. The publicity
that we can secure for the depository should enable the collection
to be of inestimable value to the various Departments in S. M. U.,
to the city of Dallas, and to the surrounding country.

    It is the sincere conviction of the faculty members of S. M. U.,
and of the members of Cycen Fjodr, that a depository located at
S. M. U. would be well placed. The collection that you have, it
seems to me, whould be made available to everyone who is interested
in such music. As long as it is in Washington, thousands of 
students will not have the opportunity to make use of this collection
which you have. In order that the utmost benefit may be derived
from this collection, copies of the recordings should be placed
in governmental depositories as soon as possible. We are
ready to communicate with Senator Hatton W. Summers at any time
regarding an appropriation for such a measure, if it would be of
any value toward getting such a system of depositories established.

    Please let me know whether or not there is any possibility
for us to secure such a collection of copies of these folk-lore
records.

    Sincerely yours,
