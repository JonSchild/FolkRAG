AL:      Yeah I heard it.
BJ:       An' so, he say, "You let me in your garden," say, "Your
daddy say let me in the garden.  Your father," he say, "Let
me in the garden an' eat all I want 'till twelve o'clock.   About
twelve o'clock, let me out."   'Cause that was when, ol', the
fox come home around twelve o'clock, from work.
         An' so, he go in there every day.   So [the] that fox [come] went out
there one day to work, in his garden.   An' nib -- all the stuff
all nibbled off.   He asked his chil'ren about it.
         An' they say, "Well, Bro' Rabbit come here every day.   He
say you say le' him in the garden an' le' 'im eat all he want
an' go back.   We thought you say so."
         Say, "No, I didn't."   Say, "When he come again." say, "You
let 'im in.   But don't you let 'im out."
         An' so he did.   An' that's where that rabbit, that straw
patch [(?)] come in there -- I know you heard that. -- But anyway,
the next day the ol' rabbit come [hibb] hippy-up, hippy-up the
hill after, after ol' Bro' Fox gone to work.   "Lil' girl!   Daddy
said let me in -- Fath' say let me in the garden.   Le' me eat
all I want.   'N' about 12 o'clock, let me out again."
         She didn't say nothin'.    She let 'im in.
         'Bout 12 o'clock, he call, "Lil' girl!  Let me out!"
She, [say,] she say, "No."   Say, "Father tol' me not to let
you outa hear."   Say, "You come here..."
         "AWW, let me out!   He's too big to go out any where.   Oh, 
he went to whompin' an' buttin' all about in the garden.   He
couldn't git out!   That's when he came in an' foun' 'im there
an' got 'im.
