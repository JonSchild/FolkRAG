War is Hell, It creates so many problems today that
one did not have yesterday. War robs the youth of
so many opportunities, at the time that he should
be making the best of life.

Said one farmer to another:
1st farmer - Have you heard about the fight going on?
2nd farmer - no! whose fighting?
1st farmer - United States & Japan.
2nd farmer - what are they fighting about?
1st farmer. - oh, some old gal named Pearl Harbor.

When one speaks of Peace, as a negro, who often
wonder if there is ever peace. Even before the war between

were at war among themselves.

At this time we speak of Conservation. As a United
Country, as a Country of United people we have
waited to late to Conserve.
