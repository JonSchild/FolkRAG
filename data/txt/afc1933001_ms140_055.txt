My dear Mr. Lomax:

I shall be happy to help collect these lumberjack records.
And I am willing to learn to operate the machine, if that is
what you desire. I thought if we had an operator from the Library
of Congress, I could send some of my students along if the work
became too continuous for the good of my regular job.

My collection of lumberwoods songs includes more than one
hundred different titles. Each title is a different ballad, not
a different version of the same ballad. For instance, i have
fourteen versions of the LUMBERJACK'S ALPHABET, but I am counting
that song one song. Of course, I have done a great deal of
collecting outside the northwoods, but my lumberwoods collection
is most valuable because least collected.

Some twelve or fourteen of these old shanty-boys live
within twenty-five miles of Mr. Pleasant. I think we might
take a Saturday jaunt or two into the Manistee and Alpena
areas; but that might not be necessary. I do think it would
pay us to get into the territory north of Saginaw and Bay City,
for recording in this area. And if I could not go myself, I
could get some competent person to go. I hope we can get this
done in April or May, for we both agree that some of our best
old-timers may make the round river drive any time now.

Please send me a list of the recordings that Bill McBride
and others made for the Archive. Then I can tell you what I
most want; and I will also know how much Bill has that he did
not sing for you. You made a good friend out of Bill.

Cordially yours,

ECBeck
