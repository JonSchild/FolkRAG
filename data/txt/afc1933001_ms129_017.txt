Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am writing to ask if it will be possible
for you to speak at the evening session of our first state
meeting, which is to be held here on Saturday, April 2.
At the New Haven meeting of the AFLS, your father suggested
to Professor Thompson, I believe, that you might be secured
to talk on negro work-songs, and that you might perhaps be
induced to sing some of them.

As our newly-organized society has no funds
as yet, I cannot assure you of any remuneration, but shall
see what can be done in that regard. If you find that you
can be present on the above-mentioned date, please write me,
and we'll try to hit upon some satisfactory arrangement.

Some weeks ago I wrote to you in regard to
our doing some recording together in this state, but have
as yet had no reply from you. Have you other plans for the
summer?

Very truly yours,
Paul G. Brewster
