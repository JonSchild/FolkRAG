Is Hitler Dead?

There has been a rumor going
around America that Hitler is dead.
Many of the people believe this
rumor and many do not. I am
among those who do not. I think
of this rumor as nazi propaganda
because Hitler started this war
and if the people are lead to
believe that he is dead they
will think that the war is just
about over and start doing something
that they wouldn't have
done during wartimes.

P. M. a New York paper had a
story in it about Hitlers death. This
paper with this particular story
in it was published about this time
last year. But then the people
didn't believe it at all and it
was not heard of for a long
while. The subject was brought
up again not so long ago and has
been going strong every since.
