Dear Alan:  I forgot to tell
you that I'm sending to Mr.
Spivacke a sketchy outline
of where I propose to travel.
It's impossible to be definite
until I have investigated
further.  At present I feel that
I could well spend a week
under the tutelage of Henry
Tremillion, for example x x
I wish you would listen
carefully to Spivacke's remarks.
In case you discover that
he is indifferent about this
trip, that he would not put
real value on it, tip me off
