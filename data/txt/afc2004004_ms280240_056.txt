Yes they thought that.  It was a Laird that did that.  He died
there about 6 or seven month ago.  Up in Elgin.  I shouldn't
record this you know.  Because its dangerous, because it
was true - quite true.  He used to carry on with...he was
an awful fellow this Laird - the Laird of Pithgaiveney up there
and there's one of the brothers alive yet.  He owns up near all
Lossie Mouth.

(He owns all land...)
All Lossie Mouth - the whole town of Lossie Mouth

(And also all the women in it)
Yes - yes well he carried on with the nurses - he took badly,
took ill one time in the hospital there and one nurse...the
two nurses, he was carrying on with the two nurses, and she
said "I'm not going bain this time to see him" she says, "You go
bain it's your turn next".  Dirty villians.

(Well Jimmy, I notice that an awful lot of the songs are about
girls that fall in love...rich girls, that fall in love with
the ploughboy
They prefer a ploughboy, a farmer boy to a big rich man)
Yes that's it.

(That's a subject in many of the songs)
And I'll explain it's a very, very complicated speech.  It, it..
I don't know how it is, but they did, they prefer a ploughman
boy before they'd prefer a rich...them brought up in the country
with them that did that.  You see it was lately that it had
beginning to spread now - go to the towns and cities oftener now.
