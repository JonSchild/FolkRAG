SOME TIME AGO, The Classics Record 
Library, a Division of Book-of-the-
Month Club, Inc., set out to assemble a 
representative collection of fold music - 
traditional songs and ballads, folk hymns 
and spirituals, blues, bluegrass and country 
music - sung by the finest folk artists of 
our day.  The Vanguard Recording Society 
gave us carte blanche to select the best 
performances available from their wealth 
of recorded music.  In addition, we were 
permitted to draw upon their collection 
of performances recorded at the famous 
Newport Folk Festival last summer.  The 
result is an album of authentic songs and 
ballads - folk music that is "perhaps the 
most endlessly enjoyable art there is," 
according to music critic John M. Conly.  
Because this brand-new album is available 
only through The Classics Record Library 
and not sold through retail stores, the 
Book-of-the-Month Club is permitting 
interested collectors to listen to the rec-
ords at home and, if not fully satisfied, 
to return the album to the Club within 
ten days, without charge.
