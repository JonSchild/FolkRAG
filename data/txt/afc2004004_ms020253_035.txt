BJ: He say, "Well, you're not in the Lord if you obeyed him
in the wrong."
     Ha, ha, ha. So, an' so, Maggie jus' got madder an' madder;
madder an' madder, it looked like it. 'Cause everything was
comdemnin'. An' that time that he say, after, would she be
willin' to beg my pardon, said, "Yeah, yeah, I willin' to beg
'er pardon."
     So. "All right." Said, "An' this is settle right here.
No more      an' no more hearsay." Said, "'Cause I
con't b'lieve Mother Jones got nothin' else to say about it."
     I say, "No, I sure ain't; I done said all I had to say."
Then it's ov' with. I didn't have nothin' to say, nohow. Didn't
even know it. 
     An' so, anyhow, she said, "Yeah."
     Me and Sister Maggie went down as we supposed to do. You
bof gets on your knees an' jine hand in hand, right hand to right
hand an' let that head man pray over you for all forgivin', 'course
you pray, too, all forgivin' in everything. An', you know, an'
let it be settle right here. An' you rise up from that, you
supposed to be as frien's. An', God knows, I am; I was a friend
to her before I got out there. Huh, huh!
     But anyhow, when we got up. Sister Maggie, we all of us,
jus' sing a song, an' everything, so, after a while somebody
said it was time to turn out, asked if there was anything anybody
got to say. Sister Maggie got up an' said, "I'd like for ya
to gimme my papers, please, cause I wanna jine another church." 
TL: Oww!
BJ: Ah, ha, ha! Hard, brother! I seen her do it, ha, ha! After
all that prayin' an' all that stuff. She jus' was outdone an'
comdemned. Tha's all. An' sho' 'nuf, she pulled out.
