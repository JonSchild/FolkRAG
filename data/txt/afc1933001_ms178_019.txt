Dear Alan Lomax -

I had a nice visit with your Dad
- short but pleasant. I'd known about
him for a long time but had never
met him before.

I wrote Dave Kapp ([Decca?]) to send 
you two of our recordings based on
folk song stuff. Apparently he has not
yet done so. My boy and I (the boy
plays a flute) have had a good deal of 
music of one sort or another written for
us. We made an album for [Decca?] last 
Fall. Three of the things are on folk
themes 'Old Joe Clark', 'Cindy' and 
'[Way?]'. I don't know when
or even whether [Decca?] will issue the album
(some of it is not so hot from the selling
angle), but the two pieces 'Cindy' and 'Old Joe
Clark' I think were pretty well done. Frank 
Luther and his gang do our singing. You 
might write Kapp and tell him to send
