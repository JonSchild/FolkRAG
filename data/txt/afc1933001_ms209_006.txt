Miss Terrill that I have been made
an honorary Phi Beta Kappa, the
first instance in ten years - probably
my last squawk. Like you
said, I didn't I would be pleased
until the award was made
to me.

Johnny and Shirley have
[both] each sent me many good letters
You'll have to improve or lose
step with them. Bess is living
(her choice) in Youth Hostels - cooking,
etc. and claiming a royal 
time. Tomorrow we go on to
Vienna, next to Buda Pesth, 
then, for me, a soft, easy
chair to watch the later days
of Spring reveal the bounty
of this gorgeous country. Switzerland
surpassed all my dreams of it. And Italy and her people
are quite unbelievable but
there they are. I hope you
will say howdy to Mr
Putnam and every member of the
Library staff beginning with Dudley.

Affectionately, Father.
