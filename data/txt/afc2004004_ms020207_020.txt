Reverend Roe.  Reel 8.  P.1
A: You understand the problem, of course.
R: Yes, I was just saying a preacher never gets to stay at home with 
his family. Therefore, lots of preacher's children, you know, they 
[Preacher never gets to stay with his family.]
[go] called bad because they don't have a father there regularly to correct them, 
and a mother can never [leave] raise boys alone. Now in my family I have three 
boys and two of my boys was with my wife; the other one was with me. 
And there's just so much difference in them. The preacher stayed with 
me all his life, after he come out of school, you know, he just stayed 
with me down here, and the other boys stayed with their mother. And

A: Why is that?
R: Well, you know, a boy is not afraid of a woman, you know, like he'd 
[Boys not afraid of their mother*]
be of a man, naturally, so that his father, when he speaks to him, why, he recog-
nizes his father's authority and he will obey[s], but it's not so with mother. 
He can kinda talk and get off, you know.  And then mothers is not as 
strict on children as fathers.
