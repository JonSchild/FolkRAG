Cowboy Songs 2.  Around the Campfire
   While the night-guards were riding herd
at the bedding ground and around remuda, the others
gathered at the campfire for an hour or so of songs and
stories before rolling in for the night.
The older men who had "heard 
the owl hooting a lot of different places and liked to
lie about it" would amuse and awe the green men and
tender feet with their takes  
of fierce stampedes, outlaws, wild animals and their sweet hearts along the trail. 
Sometimes when other camps were nearby, the men might ride over there 
a singing contest.  Each camp would back its singer
and the man who sung the last song, when each man had sung all the songs he knew, would be
proclaimed a winner.  It is the boast of some old punchers 
that they could sing through a whole week of nights without repeating themselves.
