Lately I haven't felt so chipper, and 
the consequent depressed feeling 
has made urgent a desire 
to tell you again, what I guess 
you must know well, of my deep 
concern for you to follow 
a course in life that promises 
the highest usefulness and the
most satisfying happiness. When 
you feel disposed to dwell on 
my short-comings in dealing with 
you, please be as generous as you 
can in your judgments of me 
a temporary explosion, an outburst
arising from jangled nerves, have
no bearing on my constant and permanent 
desire to see the best that 
life holds come to you, So to the 
end believe me always lovingly, 
Father.
