Lawd I been down here where the lights burn all night long.

Spoken:
I think about the woman I was lovin'---_
Sung:
Ain' but the one thing, baby, I want you to do,
Ain' but the one thing, baby, I want you to do,

I want you to meet me on Texas Avenue.*

If you get there, Martha, good while before I do,
If you get there, Marthy, good while before I do,

Want you to tell ev'body ; hon', that I'm comin' too.
