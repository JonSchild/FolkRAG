(Tell me about the time you were robbed in New York.)
I was goin up the street. Goin up Lennox Avenue. 
Two o'clock at night. I'd jes left from my friend preacher's house. 
Talkin. Two fellows overtaken me. Thought maybe they was goin my 
way. Ask me would I stop on a hundred an thirtieth street wid em. 
I thought it was all right. Jes good company, I thought. Then I 
stopped, got upon the stoop, you understan, an one of em started 
foolin round in my pocket. They have not git my money. I was 
turnin too fast fur them to git that. Made me mad. Thass one night, 
if I'd a had me a pistol, I wouldn't a been settin heah. I would 
a killed both of them. I could eat a nail I was so mad wid them. 
I didn't never give up, you understan. I - I - They slapped me in 
the face. When I got [hold of] that what I had in my pocket out 
I beat them to that, you understan. when I got that out wadn't 
nothin fur them to do. He close it down on my fingers an hit me 
in the face. If he had ever got that near me I'd a kilt him. That 
was a pocket knife, you see.
(When was the other time you were robbed?)

aftah my mothah died . . . She died in 1933. 1932. How old was I? 
Mmmmmmmm . . . . I don't jes exactly know.
(About forty?)
Naw. I ain't much ovah forty yeahs now. I'll be fifty-five

(Had you seen your mother a great deal before she died?)

my mind ever time there come a hard rain. Two three days' rain.
