Behold I stand at the door and knock, let Me come in
Sinner harden not your heart- let Me come in, hear My plea,
Open unto Me, I will give you liberty,
Sup with you and you with Me, let Me come in.

Let Him come in, let Him come in
Out of the storm, out of the rain, out of the wind,
Let Him come in, let Him come in,
Lift the gate, open the door, let Him come in.

Jesus is knocking at your door, let Him come in,
He has been there often before, let Him come in,
Should you fail to open the door, He may never come no more,
To you it may mean eternal woe, let Him come in.

He will forgive you of your sins. let Him come in,
Then He will make you fishers of men, let Him come in,
If you let Him your life controle, He'll make your wounded
spirit whole
Heal your body and bless your soul, if you let Him come in.

He will be bread in a starving land, let Him come in,
When in trouble He will hold your hand, let Him come in;
If you are naked, He will give you clothes,
Be your shelter when out of doors,
Fill you with the Holy Ghost, let Him come in.

You make one step and He'll make two, let Him come in,
Be a father and mother to you, let Him come in,
When your head is bowed in grief, He'll give you sweet relief,
You'll find comfort at His feet, let Him come in.

Trust in Him, He'll take you through, let Him come in,
When you are sick He's a doctor for you, let Him come in,
Cool your fever, ease your pains, bring you back to health again
And give you to go on, praising His name, if you let Him come in.

He'll be bread and water too, let Him come in
When in trouble He's a friend to you, let Him come in,
When confusion in your home causes your very heart to mourn.
He'll make your enemies let you alone, let Him come in.
