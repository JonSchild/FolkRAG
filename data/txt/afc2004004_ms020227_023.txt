turnt right around not far from me an' throw bof hands up.  An'
I was kinda looked at him an' I kinda looked at the do'.  'Cause
his eyes was right, was right in the do'.  An' I looked in the do'.
     When I looked in the do', I looked down the barrel of a pistol.
Big, ol' black pistol.  This man didn't come in; he just st-- just
had his haid in, jus;, jus' sumpin' was set in (?) like that.  An'
shootin' right by me like that, like that pian -- that thing
there?  Right by me!  I couldn't move.  The bullets just goin' --
Ya could see it, the fire, you know.  Oow!  Go right by me an'
then they hit that boy.
     He shot him fo' time.  Shot 'im fo' time an' I was lookin'
right at 'im.  You could see 'is body tremble, you you know.
Look like tho' things shake ya.
     Anâ€™ after that, shot 'im fo' times, he walked away.  Piana,
the man done gone, everybody else in there, near about, 'cept
them boys in that corner.  They didn't come out from across there,
ya see, 'cause 'f they did, they'd [be] a- run[nin'] in to the bullets, too.
     An', Lawd, me!  An' that boy, he fell on his knees.  Fell
on his all-fours, walkin' across the flo'.  Said, "Dontcha all run.
Don't try to run.  I ain't gonna die.  I ain't gonna die."
     Now, my crew, they 'way out there, run in the bushes somewhere.
I don' know where they had gone!  They ain't nothin' 
wrong wit' me, ya see?  They don't know what happened to me.  I'm,
I'm up there in the house with all this mess goin' on there.  An'
so, I could hear 'em a little later on out there, "Where's Bessie!"
[I] I had the coats then.  The woman was sellin', the money an'
everything else over there, I guess.  I reached over there an'
got they coats.  I didn't see her, nowhere.  They was plain gone!
'Cause them bullets was goin' straight across to [where that boy] they was, uh,
