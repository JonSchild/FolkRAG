Jan 21
Yesterday made a hellish but gorgeous
trip from PP to Aux Cayes, starting
about 8 AM and arriving about 8 P.M. via
a camion named Thorland driven by a
Haitian named Fam. Half Italian,
moustache. It was loaded all but the 2
back seats with cotton sacks and in the
[back] empty seats with room for four five or
six people were compressed. Hanging
on the side or riding the top was a 
lanky ragged boy who ran all the
errands, loaded & unloaded.  In front
with the driver were myself (on the sunny
side so that I am still suffering with
a slight sunstroke -- last night high
fever & as complete exhaustion as I ever
experienced) a Santo Domingan selling
Amer drugs and an old beard free [?]
priest who threw caramels to the proud
shy mountain people still hoping after
30 years that they would pick them up
and with them a little of the holy word.
Between times he read a prayer book.
