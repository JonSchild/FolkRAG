Dear Mr. Lomax:

We have yours of June 27th advising that the royalty arrangement
proposed in our letter of June 19th is unsatisfactory
and that you would prefer a lump cash offer. We have been
giving this matter our consideration to ascertain what would
be a fair amount to offer you, and we find it difficult to
arrive at any satisfactory figure. It has been found that
the most satisfactory and fairest basis to take care of situations
of this sort is on the royalty basis.

We have had some conversation, and we have just received letter
from Alan Lomax, stating that he had recommended that you
accept our offer of $.005 per side ($.01 per record) as
offered in our previous letter, providing it applies to the
12 selections recently recorded by Ledbelly and the Golden
Gate Jubilee Quartet. (As a matter of fact, they made 13
selections, but only 12 have been used, and we do not know at
this writing just which one will not be used.) According to
the suggestion made by Alan Lomax, we are sending for your
signature the usual license agreement on the basis of $.01 a
record, and applying to the 12 sides which will be used. We
really believe this is a fairer way to handle the matter, and
we trust you will see your way clear to accept our proposal.

May we hear from you at your early convenience.

Very truly yours,
HC Darnell
