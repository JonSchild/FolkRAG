some work there to keep them from knowin' that.  'Cause it show; 
wonder why the house off the block.
     And ah, we had a line, a a jise (joist) across there.  You
know we hang up, jus' [, jus'] chunk up the, the clo'es on, [the, on...]
ya know.  An' ah, this shack           , ya know.  An' so, the jise
done gone back this way almost to, heh (head of the bed ?).
I could see they's gonna pay that no mind.  Nobody didn't pay
that no mind, [to] when they come in, ya see.  After I got my supper done an'
everything.  But, brother, I was tired, ya know?  An' so, I 
looked at the house; the house was well done.  Everything fixed
good.  Nobody need know nothin'.
     They got in the car to go up to Kagsamon an' I didn't sit
in it; I watched to see how the car gonna act.  It done alright!
They went on.  Nobody know nothin'.  I was happy.  Hah, nobody
know anything about it.
     An' so , a little later on, this storm come, see? An' when,
an' when the storm come, hit blew the walls, the ah, ah, the walls at the
back. It come at the back of the house. Ya see, tha's the way
most of the win' was comin'. And it really blows, ya know, over
there, in [those] other words, it didn't storm like it did on the
Lake. We just got the tail end, ya know. And so...
TL: Well, was it a hurricane?
BJ: That hurricane, that '28 hurricane that killed all those
folks, on, on the Lake, um-hum. An' it was, it was jes', but had it
came over there like that, it woulda jus' smashed us out, ya know.
'Cause we was jus' lil' six mile out. [That] I was on Kagsamon.
An' [an'] in Marc--an' um, in Collier County.
