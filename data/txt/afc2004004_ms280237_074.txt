Cox: . . .years old, an' it went like this here

Once I could lay in a bed,
A bed of the very best down,
But now I am glad of a bunch of wheat straw
To keep my poor bones from the ground.

So adieu to old England, here's adieu,
Here's adieu to five thousand odd pounds;
If the world had been banished before I was born
My troubles I should not have know.

So once I could drink of that beer,
The very best beer of the glass,
But now I am glad of cold water,
To quench my poor lips from the thirst.

So here's adieu, etc.

That's all I know of that un.
Lomax: What's that about, Harry?
Cox: Oh, you know, it's about money matters (laughing). . .somebody
spent a fortune, he spent it out, an' that's how he finished up.

Cox: The spring had come, the flowers in bloom,
The birds sang sang out their lay.
Down by a little running brook
I first saw Maggie May.

She had a         jet-black eye,
She was singin' all the way.
Oh how I love her, none can tell,
My little Maggie May.

Maggie, little witchin' Maggie,
Maggie, singin' all the day.
Oh, how I love her, none can tell,
My little Maggie May.

Cox: As I walked out one May mornin',
One May mornin' so early,
I overtook a fair young maid
Just as the day was a-dawnin'.
With my doo rum a da, fal the riddle ah
Fal the ra riddle i o.

Her shoes were black, her stockings white,
An' her buckles shone like silver;
She had a dark an' a rolling eye,
An' her hair hung down her back.
