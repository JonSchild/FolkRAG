Mr. R. P. Wetherald
RCA Manufacturing Company
Camden, New Jersey

Dear Mr. Wetherald:

Practically everyone in the Library of Congress
feels that you have made a serious mistake by
not including "Whoa Back Buck" in the Leadbelly
album.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge of the
Archive of American Folk Song
