This IS the RAF's Song
     About Terrified Airmen
   The following is the song I alluded to
(see Page 6). It comes from the Northern
Command and was taken down by Quentin
Reynolds of Colliers, Ed Beattie of the
United Press, and Red Mueller of INS.
The word "obscenity" has been substituted
for one word and wherever you see
the word "blessed you may know that
also represents a little cleaning - a substitution.
They say there's a Hudson just leaving
   Norway
Bound for old Scotland's shore,
Heavily laden with terrified airmen
Bound for the land they adore.
There's many a Heinkel around in the
   Skaggerak
And many a Messerschmitt too,
You'll get no promotion that side of the
   ocean,
So cheer up my lad Bless 'em all.
Bless 'em all, bless 'em all; the slim and
   the short and the tall
Bless all the sergeants and W.O.I's; their
    blessed daughters and their obscenity
   sons
Bless 'em all, Bless 'em all, as up the
   C. O.'s obscenity they crawl
They'll get no promotion that side of the
   ocean.
So cheer up my lads-bless 'em all.

   Here is another song:
All day long we haven't flown above six
hundred blessed feet;
The weather it was full of snow and full
   of blessed sleet;
The compass it was swinging from south
   to blessed north,
And we made our blessed landfall in the
   Firth of blessed Forth.
