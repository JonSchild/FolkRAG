Mr Alan Lomax,

Dear Sir,

I received my ten
dollars alright. But
I have had so 
much sickness and 
deaths in the family 
I couldn't get around
to write you. But
I am doing fine at 
present. I want you 
to write me and
let me know your
dads address I'd
like to write him.
I have here a little
piece of poetry
I composed myself.
