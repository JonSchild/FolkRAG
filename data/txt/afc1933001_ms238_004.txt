Dear Alan: From my point
of view it was my need to 
hear from you and not your 
"need" to write to me. Anyhow, 
I thank you for the scroll 
that came to me today. Duncan Emerich
writes garrulously and delightfully.
Why not send him a machine 
to meet me in Denver [and] so 
I could get him under way?
I'll be glad he is to be around 
during the "conference."  Already
I am beginning to dread it.

I suggest that you get away
from Washington early enough
for you to rest awhile here

[*Lots of room for you both*]
