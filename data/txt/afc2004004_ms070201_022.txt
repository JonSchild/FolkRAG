Simbi was gone.
I stood by feeling the beauty of 
the whole ceremony but not aware
until after -- except for a moment 
[while bowing] when I bowed to Law'ence and
saw his eyes a little fixed and glazed
I felt -- that Simbi [was] had been there
in Law'ence.  Later the Doctor explained 
the whole ceremony and what Simbi 
had said.  [He went] Then I volunteered 
[the explana] an account of his, the
Doctor's, possession of two nights
before.
About twelve, after a long session 
of singing drumming and dancing,
the Dr. suddenly appeared in the
door of his bedroom with a black 
handkerchief tied about his neck
a small calabash [and] a bottle and 
a [cocoa] cocomacaque in his hand.
