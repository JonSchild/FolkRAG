Dear Mrs. Roy:
I have been interviewed several times in the past few months in regard to my work in folk-lore, and I always mention the "Cajun" field because it is so rich in vital, new, and colorful material. I am shocked to discover that the Times Picayune quoted me in the fashion that it did, but you must realize that newspaper reporters tend to color their stories to make them as sensational as possible. I have never worked in the community that I had a higher regard for than the Louisiana French. And when we meet at the National Folk Festival (after performance) I hope you will realize how sorry I always been that I didn't grow in a community where French and English were both spoken so that in my work in Louisiana I often had to ask for help in translation from friendly Cajuns.
Sincerely yours,
Assistant in Charge
