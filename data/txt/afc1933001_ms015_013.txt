Robert Kleberg, Esq.
Kingsville, Texas

My dear Mr. Kleberg:

Professor John A. Lomax, Honorary Custodian of our Archive
of American Folk-Song in the Library of Congress, has written to
me of his interesting visits to your King Ranch. Professor Lomax,
as he may have told you, is collecting folk-song material for the
Library. He and his son, Alan, are making recordings for us on a
machines specifically constructed for the purpose. His recordings,
made so far, have proved of unusual interest and value to scholars
and students of folk literature and folk music.

Mr. Lomax seems especially anxious to attend the Spring roundup
at the King Ranch this year, with a view to having some of the
Mexican "compokes" make recordings. This note is merely intended
to emphasize the scientific merit of Mr. Lomax's work, and to ask
for your kind assistance when he presents himself. Your courtesy
will be greatly appreciated by the Library.

Faithfully yours,

Librarian

P.S. Under separate cover I am sending you a copy of the "Musical
Quarterly" for April 1934 where on pages 177 and 187 you will find
a characteristic article of Mr. Lomax's. A book recently finished
by him will shortly be published by the Macmillan Company in New
York.
