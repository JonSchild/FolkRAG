Mr. Robert MacGimsey
San Antonio, Texas

Dear Mr. MacGimsey:

This is in answer to your letter of June 19. I am
pleased to learn that you have received a grant for the
collection of Negro folk music but I cannot tell you definitely
yet whether or not we shall have a machine for
you by July 20. I shall investigate the possibilities and
let you know in a short while. In the meantime, I wish to
make certain things clear.

First of all, the machines are equipped to run on AC
currently only. DC current is very impractical for recording
but a converter run by batteries can be used where no AC is
available. The whole machine is not very heavy, weighing
less than 100 pounds and occupies the space of a large suit
case.

I regret that we cannot accede to the request for
restrictions which you make. Should we cooperate with you
in a recording venture, all the original discs will have to
be deposited in the Library. We will probably accept reasonable 
restrictions with a definite time limit to give you an
opportunity to publish them first. We cannot restrict any
records for as long as you may want them. In other words,
we can make arrangements for your exclusive use for a limited
period of time after which we should have to make the records
available to the general public.

The government allowances for travel by automobile are
five cents per mile. I do not believe, however, that the
Rockefeller Foundation has any set rules about this.

Please let me have your reaction to this letter so that
I can continue to investigate to possibilities of the loan
of a recording machine.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
