Mr. Alan Lomax
562 West 143th Street, Apt. 3 D
New York City

Dear Alan:

I have been "chasing"Mr. Strong for several days only to be told,
when I spoke to him this morning that his foundation is temporarily
embarrassed financially. He kindly offered his personal note if it
was a case of dire emergency but I declined that obvious reasons.

I believe, however, that I shall be able to solve your financial
problem in another way, I discussed the matter with Mr. Bond and he
agreed to a loan of $250 until we can get a grant - subject, of 
course, to the Librarian's approval. I am recommending this loan 
and shall have it before the Librarian when he returns tomorrow. Mr.
Bond further agreed that in the eventuality that no grant is received,
he would not press you for this but would postpone discussion of repayment
until your return and then suit your convenience. This seems 
the best solution.

The shipment of the records and other material has caused quite
a bit of trouble. I think we have it settled at last to the satisfaction
of the mail division and the express company. It left this 
morning.

I am afraid that you are driving yourself to distraction as
evidenced by the enclosed envelope, the missing enclosure (B.B.C.)
and the fact that Miss Rogers has not received your letters. You
will need a calmness (heretofore missing) if you are to imbibe all
the wisdom surrounding you in New York!

I am leaving for New York tomorrow on an important business trip.
You might call me up at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel on Friday or Saturday
(morning only). If I possibly can, I shall try to see you.

Sincerely,


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
