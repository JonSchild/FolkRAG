Dear Mr. Darling:
Thank you for your letter explaining the
background of the Bessie Jones affair.  I
have had another letter from them in Los
Angeles and would greatly appreciate your
paying the $200 that my sister advanced to
them for transportation as soon as possible.
Her name and address are:
Mrs. Bessie Hawes
1628 Palm Court
Santa Monica, California
If it would not be too much to ask, I would
like to know when it would be possible for
you to clear up this matter.
Very truly yours,
Alan Lomax
