come sumpin else. It wasn' t no coon and it wasn't no possum,
but it was a big, grizzly bear.  And me and mapw didn't have to
shift nary gear--we's already in high. And me'n paw and that bear---
and by me being a little younger than I paw I gets in front of
paw. I looked back at paw and the bear was playing nip and
tuck with him.  Every time the [paw] the bear would nip at paw,
paw would tuck in some. By paw  having a little more speed than me,
paw gets back in front of me.  I told him , "Paw, let'shave prayer.
You's a preacher. " He says, Son, prayers all right in prayer meetin
, but it ain't worth a durn in bear meeting."
