Dear Mrs. Brown:
    Thank you for your card expressing interest in
my work and in folklore and local history.

    I am enclosing separates from the Library of
Congress' Annual Reports for 1934-35 and 1935-36, in
which you will find accounts of several field trips
of mine, made in connection with the Archive of Folk-
Song in the Library of Congress (pp. 27 and 20, res-
pectively). For a more complete survey of my work,
I suggest that you consult my "Cowboy Songs", 2 volumes,
"American Ballads and Folksongs", and "Negro Folksongs
as Sung by Leadbelly."

    For some time, the Archive of Folk-Song in the
Library of Congress has been engaged in building up a
collection of records of American folk-music, that is,
the old ballads, reels, hymns, cowboy songs, and the like
that have been handed down from generation to generation,
or have been composed by and sung by people without the
aid of writing or print.

    It is very probable that you may know of some local
tunes which have not yet found their way into our collec-
tion. I should be most grateful to you if you would ac-
quaint me with any such material, as well as any native
singers, fiddlers, and so on, who might be able torrecord
these local tunes for me, should the Archive be able to
send its recording machine to your district. These records
would be deposited here in the Library for the instruction
and pleasure of the American people.

    Should you have any further requests, I shall be happy
to be of service.

    Sincerely yours,
    Honorary Consultant and Curator
