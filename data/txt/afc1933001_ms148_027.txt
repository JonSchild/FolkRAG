Omit the comma before "and" in simple enumerations (as in the preceding
paragraph). 

Book titles occurring in the running text should be capitalized
in the ordinary manner (i. e., the initial letter of the first word and of
every other word not an article or a preposition) and underscored. (If
the title of an article or chapter is cited together with the name of the 
publication in which it appeared, the former should not be underscored but
enclosed in double quotes.)

Titles cited in bibliographic lists or in footnotes cast in bibliographic 
form should follow the technical library practice.

Bibliographic references not incorporated in the running text should 
be cast in the established professional form. (Exceptions: "Report of the
Librarian of Congress," 1938 [19337, etc.] and otherwise cumbersome refer-
ences to corporate and government publications.)

Lists and enumerations should be arranged in alphabetical order,
except where some other consideration that workmanlike appearance supervenes.

Closing quotes should follow, not preced, a comma or period, regard-
less of logical considerations.

Numbers from 1 to 99 and even hundreds and thousands should be spelled
out, except in statistical tables and financial figures. 

The second figure of a pair of inclusive dates or page references 
should be given in full. (E. g. 1861-1865, p. 165-167.)
