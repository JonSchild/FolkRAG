Dear Mr. Lomax:

On April 26, 1941 there was outstanding from
you to Columbia Lecture Bureau of Columbia
Artists, Inc. a debt in the amount of $96.17,
which at that time was assigned to Music
Corporation of America or one of its subsidiaries. 
On March 10, 1942 the balance you owed on this 
account to Music Corporation or its subsidiaries
was $96.17.

This latter balance has been assigned to Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. so that you are now
indebted to us in that amount.

Will you please remit to Columbia Broadcasting
System, Inc. $96.17 by return mail in payment of
your said debt to us.

Very truly yours,
