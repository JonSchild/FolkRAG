APPALACHIAN JOURNEY   -15

have in this book here where a fellow is telling about the
first time he ever heard a fiddle.  And he, he says Lordy, I
thought that was the prettiest, sweepinest music that I'd
ever heard.  I wanted to holler and jump up and down.  I
just couldn't set, sit still on that log bench when that
tune started snaking around the school house.  I let out a
yell and lept off that bench and commenced to dance and clog
around.  And everybody was hollerin' and laughin'.  And
every time he'd touch the bow to them strings hell would
break loose in that school house.
[MUSIC]
AL  You see that hand sliding on that
string?  That doesn't happen in the fiddling of the [old]
country.  That's the blacks for you.  And notice how he
shakes that middle body of his.  I mean there's another sign
of the black influence.  'Cause Tommy, you see, grew up in a 
country right on the border of the deep south where there
was lots of contact between black and white music.
[MUSIC, SINGING]
AL  Hearing the playing of the Thomas
brothers who are tobacco farmers down in the [Piedmont], we
see the kind of thing that the mountaineers were so much
influenced by many years ago.  As close as we can get to it
