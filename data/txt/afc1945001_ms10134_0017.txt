On boarding train from New York City,
in uniform, I was accosted by a
rather unattractive woman who started,
as she thought, cheering me up. I 
was supposed to be on my way
back to camp. (In reality, I am
a member of the R.O.T.C.) Not
knowing the woman or needing her
cheering-up or being attracted to her
anyhow, she was ignored. She then
said "That's all right, you'll
think of me when you get back
to camp." She knew she was 
unattractive too.
