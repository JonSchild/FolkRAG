just got oot from the camp a bit and blew a whistle. And
another 6 or 7 come in with great big guns slung over their
shoulders. They were in hiding -- they weren't out for good.
Whatever their intentions was, they weren't there for no good.
If it hadn't been for the baker coming on the round - as these
bakers goes in the country these days - now a lot of vans is
out it's different - but it was nothing for a baker to be
on the road all day and all night. And the baker coming home
went for help at the first farm. They riddled the wagon where
the two children was into; me parents had to lie flat on their
bellies on the wagon, and they riddled the wagon with shots.
They shot the horse, they shot the bairn's pet rabbits,
and they held the gun at my grandfather'd head because he was
gaeing to gang for help. But the baker come on them unawares.
The baker jumped off at the farm, and the farmer and his servants
- which at that time it was nothing for 6 or 7 farm-servants to 
be at a farm -- they come down and helped.
Lomax: Did they tell at campfires, any fairy stories or things
like that?
Jean: Oh yes. They did tell ghost stories.
Lomax: Those are just as important to get down as the ballads.
They're part of the history of Scotland. See if you could scratch
up one and tell us.
Jean: I remember I used to tell them to the children myself. . . .
I do know a lot, but they're out of my mind for a while. We said,
"O tell us a story". . . . .and they would tellt us.
Lomax: How would they begin. . ."Once upon a time?"
Jean: Yes, that was it. "Once upon a time," that was the way
to start it. If they were going to tell us bairns a story, they
would start maybe by saying, "Once upon a time when pigs and 
swines and monkeys chewed tobacco. . . . ." That was to please us.
We said, "O tell us a story," when we was little at the campfires
at night. Well, maybe to keep us quiet, they'd maybe say,
"Well, sit down and I'll tell" -- somebody ventured to tell us
a story - anybody that could be bothered with us, like . . . .
They'd maybe say, "Once upon a time when pigs and swines and
Monkies chewed tobacco and hens put on their clogs to go and see
the market. . . " This was the start of the story. "Once there was
an old woman. She lived in a little croft, and she had one son.
And this son wasn't very right. They called him Silly John, or
something like that. Well one day, she was going away from home,
and she says, "Now, John, the Factor'll be here today." (You
