Weevily Wheat (cont'd)

Chorus

Oh, I won't have one of your weevily wheat,
I won't have none of your barley,
It'll take some flour and half an hour
To bake a cake for Charley.

Often the figures of a set were so well known that the
chanted directions were omitted entirely, the dancers all 
singing as they "swung corners," "do ce doed," gave "grand 
right and left," joned hands and circled in groups of four, 
six, and eight, promenaded; made the figure eight or other 
figures of the dance.

As he sang, Bob would often jump to the center and cut 
the "pigeon wing," "back step," or "double shuffle"--"Just to 
show some of you slow drags how to dance," Bob explained.

Next would come "Shoot the Buffalo," a little slower in 
movement, but still lively enough to make the girls breathless.

Shoot the Buffalo

And it's ladies to the center
And it's gents around the row,
And we'll rally round the canebrake
And shoot the buffalo.

Chorus

And we'll shoot the buffalo, we'll
shoot the buffalo,
We'll rally round the canebrake and
shoot the buffalo.

Rise you up, my dearest dear,
Present me to your paw,
I'm sure you've got tobacco,
I'd like to have a chaw.
