THE WORKER'S MARSEILLAISE
(Melody - The Marseillaise)

Ye sons of toil, awake to glory!
Hark, hark, what myriads bid you rise;
Your children, wives and grandsires hoary---
Behold their tears and hear their cries!
Behold their tears and hear their cries!
Shall hateful tyrants mischief breeding,
With direling hosts, a ruffian band---
Affright and desolate the land,
While peace and liberty lie bleeding?

CHORUS To arms! to arms! ye brave!
The avenging sword unsheathe!
March on, march on, all hearts resolved
On Victory or death.

With luxury and pride surrounded,
The vile, insatiate depots date,
Their thirst for gold and power unbounded
To mete and vend the light and air
To mete and vend the light and air,
Like beasts of burden they would load us,
Like gods would  bid their slaves adore,
But man is man, and who is more?
Then shall they longer lash and goad us?

O! Liberty, can man resign thee
Once having felt thy generous flame?
Can dungeon's bolts and bars confine thee?
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?
Or whips thy noble spirit tame?
Too long the world has wept bewailing, 
That falsehood's dagger tyrants wield;
But freedom is our sword and shield;
And all of their arts are unavailing!
