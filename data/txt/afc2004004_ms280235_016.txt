Lomax: Did you ever play for a wake?
Barry: Actually no. I'd be crying someway and another. I was invited
to a wake but I didn't take part in it. That was away in Northern
Ireland, and I just happened to be in the fair playing away and
singing, - "The Drummer Boy," "The Hills of Donegal" and "The Bold
Fenian Men." I was up in the square and a woman came up and said,
"Why do you not sing down that square there?"
I says, "I haven't time yet. I have to finish around here."
She says, "Well, if you go down there, there's a house on the left,
and I'll be at the door and I'll wave to you and would you come in
and have a cup of tea?"
     I thanked her very much and said I would. So after a few minutes
here I said I'd take a walk down the hill, and good enough, she did
wave to me, and I went to her. And when I went in, I saw the corpse
on the bed, like. I hesitated. I didn't want to drink tea there.
So she says to me, "Do come in."
So I just took the cup of tea in my hand - I wouldn't eat nothing.
She says, "If you could sing a song here for us now."
I says, "No, with that person dead in the bed." I says, "No, I
couldn't do that. If I was used to it -- but I'm not. I'd cry."
"Well," she says, "We'd like you to sing anyway. Will you sing outside?"
I said, "It might be better. I'll sing outside, if you'll premit me.
It doesn't. . ."
"Oh no," says she. "We usually do, though. We have singers at wakes."
"Well," I says, "In my part of the country, they don't. All sorrow.
Just kneel and pray. But the music -- in fact, if you went up and 
started playing a banjo there, you'd get hurt or something. You
don't do things like that in our part of the country. But," I says,
"There is parts of the country where they do. It's not only in this
little town. I know several more." And so I had. But, trouble was,
whenever I saw lots of people round the doors, it makes me suspicious.
I goes down to look, and soon as I do know what it is - it's a wakex -
and I keep miles away from it.
Lomax: Did you ever hear anybody kening? (Keening)
Barry: Wh at we call keening is a lament. It means, like, all the
time lamenting for somebody, sorrowful.
Lomax: Did you ever hear anybody do this?
Barry: Well I did. They sounded mmmmmm-mmmmm, that sort of way. I
heard that once and I asked these people at this lament. That was at
Wexford, way up, from Munster. But it is a county for that - and
diddling. Then there's parts of Wexford they have the lamentations.
Lomax: Did you ever hear anybody singing a lullabye to a baby.
Barry: I did.
