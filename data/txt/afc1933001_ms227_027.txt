Dear Alan: I am telling
Mr. MacLeish that you have entire
charge of the authors and
of the book. Please see or
phone, put into his hands some of
the real poetry of our songs,
and get him to work on
his job. I imagine that
MacMillan can slip his copy
in at the last moment. But do
you get it written at the
earliest moment. I still
think this idea of yours is
fine for the book. With abject
apologies for sending you another
letter. Affectionately always, Father -
