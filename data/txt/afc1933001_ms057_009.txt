Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I'm very glad to say the machine is working satisfactorily,
though as yet I have not found any sapphire cutting needles. No
mention of them in the memorandum of supplies. The new set of
tubes, cables recor-ered [sic] and general overhauling is
resulting in fairly good recordings.
I told Alan that the Gamut matter was in your hands    Gamut
writes me that you are to have the originals. That would save
the Library one set of duplicates. The additional time for two
sets of originals when I find a group of fine singers would make 
little difference. The possibility of making a little extra 
money I should welcome. Gamut, as you know, furnishes his own
records, needles, etc. Tell me frankly how you feel. I am sure
you know that I did not seek this commission.
I am working out of Houston in this rich territory.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
