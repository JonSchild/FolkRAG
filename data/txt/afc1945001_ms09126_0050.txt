member.  I also belong to a club called
the Russian War Relief.  It really
has children of all races but we
named it that because the
Russians are doing a great part
for this war.  We go from door
to door collecting clothing and milk
money and sell defense stamps.  All
the thing we get are sent downtown
to the Red Cross and they
see that it is send across.  There
are over 1 million children in this
club all over the United States and
we are trying to make it larger
and larger.
