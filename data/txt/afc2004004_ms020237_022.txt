BJ: In the, in the, in the winda. It's sittin ' in the winda.
You put a cat now in that winda; he [ain't] is not in the house an' he's not
outdo's. Hum, hum! It's a cat sittin' in the winda. It sure
ain't in the house. Ha, ha, ha! An' it sure ain't outdo's.
Hu, hu! So it's a cat sittin' in the winda.
Turn it down so I can think of one...I got to think,
I got to think how it go, anyway...
What is this? "Sometime it go all day long, from mornin' to
night. An' sometime it don't go all day. Sometime it jus',
jus' go. But all aroun' in the house. An' it come home at night
an' sit up in the corner wit' it's tongue out."
TL: A hound.
BJ: A hound ain't got no business up in the house at night.
TL: Oh, it don't?
BJ: No-o.
TL: Didn't ya ever let your hounds in and put 'em behind the stove?
BJ: No. Oh, no, oh, no. Unlessen they was mighty lil' puppies.
But this here goes all day sometimes, all day long. Then it come
in the house an' set up in the corner with it's tongue out.
TL: A husband.
BJ: No-o, hah! It sound like 'im, don't it? But it ain't. 
No, it's a husband's shoe...Ha, ha, ha! It's a husband's shoe;
it's a man's shoe. A-ha, he...! Ha, ha, all day long. Then 
it set there with the tongue out. A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha!
What, what is this here. Ah, Le' me see how it, yeah...It got;
le' me see. It got eyes...yeah. "He got eyes an' he cain't see,
an' he got a tongue an' he cain't talk, an' he got a soul an' 'e
cain't be saved."
TL: Shoe.
