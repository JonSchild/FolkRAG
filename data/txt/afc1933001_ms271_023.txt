So Long, It's Been Good to Know You
-Woody Guthrie

I got the news that the war had begun,
It was straight for the army hall that I run;
And all of the folks in my old home town
Were a running up and a running down, singing

Ch: So long, it's been good to know you!
So long, it's been good to know you!
So long, it's been good to know you,
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won,
So I've got to be drifting along.

The crowd was packed by the railroad track
People a-yelling and patting my back;
The engineer was ringing his bell,
I hugged all the mothers and kissed all the gals, singing

I got to the camp and I learned how to fight,
Fascists in day time, mosquitos at night,
I got my orders to cross the blue sea,
So I waved goodbye to the folks I could see, singing

I got on a boat and I started to float,
My old packsack and my big wool coat,
With ten thousand men, we rode the foam,
And sung this song to the people back home, it was

I landed somewhere on a fighting shore,
Seen ten million soldiers and ten million more
And when he was chasing that super race,
We sung this song in the chase, it was

These fascist shores can't last very long,
All of their likes will be through and gone,
We'll throw the clods of dirt in their face,
And walk away from that lonesome place, singing
