audience will be interested and 
moved by your singers, particularly 
if you confine your 
program to the more primitive 
songs, both words and 
music and
let the negroes show they come direct 
from the farm 
through the style of their dress.
The inclusion of all ages from 
children to very old people 
produces a happy effect 
the picture of a negro reverie in the plantion 
[and] the chorus singing 
and clapping were both especially natural 
and effective. I recommend 
the performances heartily.

Sincerely yours,

Curator and Honorary Consultant
