If Mt. Gordon left any stationery
on hand, I think it would

Alan is now running 
the machine near Brunswick,
Georgia, along the sea-cost.
From there he will go down 
into Florida, the only Southern 
State in which we not yet collected 
materials. Meanwhile 
I am following the old Cattle
Trails from Texas to North
Dakota locating and rounding up single 
singers and groups of singers
to be visited again later and 
their songs recorded
