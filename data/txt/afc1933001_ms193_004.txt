OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY     July 20, 1945 

Dr. Allan Lomax 
Asst. Librarian of the Division of Music 
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Dr. Lomax: 

The recordings of the Amish hymns which you kindly sent 
me in the fall of 1938 and also the transcriptions which 
we made from them are practically worn out. I have been 
using them in connection with a lecture on the Old Order 
Amish: Their Folkways, and Hymn Tunes. I should like to 
purchase several copies: one of the Lobgesang "O Gott Vater 
Wir Loben Dich" and any others which will fill the other 
side of the record. I shall be especially pleased to 
receive these within the next two or three weeks because 
I am scheduled to deliver this lecture at the Ypsilanti 
State Hospital, Ypsilanti, Michigan, about the middle of 
August. Your recording and my lecture have had the 
effect of "softening" the attitude of the Amish in northern 
Indiana. I am beginning to be hopeful that we may before 
very long secure their permission to record both male and 
female voices singing these hymns. 

Mrs. Umble and son Roy often speak with a great deal 
of pleasure of your visit here and of their experience 
in helping to secure the recordings. You may be interested 
in knowing that I gave my lecture at [Middlebury] Maryville, Indiana, 
where Professor Sateren of Augsburg College, Minneapolis, 
is now educational director of the Civilian Public Service 
camp. 

Sincerely yours, 
John Umble
