Who repeats ill of his wife dishonors himself 

The oldest man who ever lived died at 
last. 
You weren't home when [?] was [?]
divided
A [hen's?] heart goes with misery
No shame on a man to be weak, but to be 
soft 
Woman's patience - till you count three

Two blacks the [?]y tis sweat
Better be dead than a fat slave
Close the good mother's daughter, were the 
Devil her father 
Worst of luck, alder green
" thing human, malice been 
Worst of d[?], wine without life
But worst of all things, a bad wife
