Dear Al: [*Fields*]

                 The camera is the most exciting thing I've
ever had in my life. I wonder if you knew they
didn't include the portrait lens as you indicated 
in your first letters? I have'nt taken a picture 
with it as yet, but look forward with pleasure.

                                           Yours,

                                        Alan
