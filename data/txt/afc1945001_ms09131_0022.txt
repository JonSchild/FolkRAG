Some people feel that it is entirely President 
Roosevelt's fault that the present war is going on.  
Jokes have been told to the effect that Roosevelt 
is acquiring a great deal of money now.  

There is a joke about a father telling a 
man how easily it was for his son to evade 
the draft board.  All he did was use bribery 
and assure the board that he was engaged in 
necessary work.
