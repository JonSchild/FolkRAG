Say, "I ain't got no hat."
Say, "I'll git you a little hat."
Say, "I ain't got no money to put in my pocket."
Say, "I'll give you some money to put in your pocket."
So the preacher turned around right then and went back
to town and got the little boy a suit, shoes, hat and come back and
give him fifty cents to put in his pocket.  The little boy come on 
to church that night. Old Reverend got up and say, " Come on up, 
son, come right on up to the front." His daddy, sitting back there,
didn't know what was coming off. The little boy stepped up there,
on the pulpit where the preacher was and old Reverend say,
             "Now I have a little boy here, just a lad of a boy, who
is going to sing a song and I want you all to pay strict attention.
Every word of this song is just as true as you see me standing
here."
                 Everybody was looking at the boy and wondering what he
was gonna sing. They didn't even know he knowed no song -- knowed
he'd never been to church. So old Reverend told him, said, "Now,
son, don't be afraid.  Raise yourself up and be strong and I want 
you to sing with uplifted voice."
                 The boy pulled his little coat up on him, you know, 
cut his eye over[R] at his daddy, started off singin..
               Passed by the preacher's gate one day,
               He was playing a game of cards...
                   Old preacher begin to bug his eyes and look...
               He gave me this little hat that fits so well,
               And this half a dollar not to tell...
                    So old Reverend, he jumped out the back window of that
church and they didn't see him around there no more.
