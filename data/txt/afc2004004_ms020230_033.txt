[*GRANDPARENTS HOMEMADE WHISKEY*]
TL:     Is that right?
BJ:     Yeah. Straight-out ol' moonshine! A lot of it, this cheap 
stuff, an' folks goin' crazy an' cuttin' the fool, the place 
stink, ya can smell it a mile 'fore ya git there?   Nothin' but 
that moonshine, colored. Tha's all. That cheap whiskey. 
TL:     Bessie, do a lot of people make that stuff now?
BJ:     I reck- - I reckon they does.  You can hear talk over the air; 
I does, ya know.  Hear talk of - - on the air - - [of] over, you know, 
the radio - - robb[in'] their still in this place and that place. 
You know,                            like that. But I don't, but I 
don't, but I don't deal with the stuff and don't                 [now.]
TL:    When did they pass a law about no more moonshine?
BJ:    Ever since they started sellin' sealed whiskey, far as I 
know.of.
TL:    Even when your grandfather. . . Even then?
BJ:    Um-hum. Yeah. I heard about that from them, 'cause they 
made their own corn whiskey. They, they didn't sell it; just made 
it for their own use.  Made about 10 gallons. Have about 5 or 
10 gallon[s] kags (kegs).  But he didn't use it that way.   Jus'  
have it in a kag. Ya know, they made it and then it -- wouldn't have to 
make it but 'bout once a year, see, like that. 'Cause [we] they jus' 
put it in a kag, was, you know, real kag. An' let it char dere, 
see?   An' stay in that kag.  Take a lil' bit off -- take, take 
about half a teacup full?  Once a day, an' tha's in the winter. 
But that's for the wintertime.  But that's the way they took theirs, 
as, as, as the Bible say, they took it as a medicine. The Bible 
speaks of that, ya know.  If you do take it, take it, it's for yo'
[som] stomach's sake, nor for yo' head's sake.  See?
