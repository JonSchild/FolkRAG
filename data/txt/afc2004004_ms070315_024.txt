The gov. builds the levees & we maintain
them - av. 30 ft. hi. - 300 to
500 ft. wide.

Even before the Civil War - Irish laborers
came over and got jobs on the railroads
"called hoppers" = during the '70's
they covered the country -
Back in the '60's & 70's would
[bar] take contracts for 100 feeet
of 10 or 12 ft levell. - built
with wheelbarrows - called "station men."
Big contractors in Memphis  - like Duffy &
McGhee & Arnold - would [m] bond themselves
to do [some] 10 miles - they would
in turn bid in to sub-contractors
and they would let to the stationmen
who were paid by the yard.
The s-c's would board the station men 0 
and send the jiggerboy
around with a jig of whiskey
