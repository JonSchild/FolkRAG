TO LABOR
Charlotte Perkins Gilman

Shall you complain who feed the world,
Who clothe the world, who house the world
Shall you complain who are the world,
Of what the world may do?

As from this hour you use yur power
The world must follow you.
As from this hour you use your power 
The world must follow you.

The world's life hangs on your right hand, 
Your strong right hand, your skilled right hand,
You hold the whole world in your hand.
See to it what you do.

Or dark or light, orwrong or right,
The world is made by you.
Or dark or light, or wrong or wright,
The world is made by you.

Then rise as you ne'er rose before, 
Nor hoped before, nor dared before, 
And show as ne'er was shown before
The power that lies in you.

Stand all as one, till right is done
Believe and dare and do
Stand all as one, till right is done
Believe and dare and do.
