Hitler call the devil on the
phone one day
the operator listen to all
they had to say.
Hitler told the devil I am not
doing so well these days
I wanted to take the United
States
And all I got was nays.
The devil told hitler you
aren't using your head
for if you were, you would
long been dead.
Franklin D. Rosevelt was
listen and he just laugh until
he cried
Because he was just listen
how hitler were telling thoes
awful lies.
