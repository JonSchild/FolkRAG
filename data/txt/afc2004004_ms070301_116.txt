The Stone of Tigue.

The excisemen come to 
take the cattle - 
Cow's Croon
They find 3 pitiful 
cows + take them away -
And the old man sends 
his curse after them -
Then the storm - 
Why doesn't Tigue like the boy?
The courtroom
The wake at the 
end.  Keening.

Opening Salute to Torey Island + the characters Tigue + Kitty in Pat Came 
Over the Hill.
