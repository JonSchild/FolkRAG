[*Prothero : 1933*]

Dear Lomax:

Enclosed is a letter from Governor McAlister of Tennessee
which brings the distressing news that your protege, Allen
Prothero, died on April 9.

Sometime ago Mildred, at my request, interested herself
in getting this man paroled. When finally Judge Miller, who wished
first to have an opportunity to interview the Governor personally,
submitted a formal request for Allen's parole, he received the reply
which I enclose. We are very sorry, as I know you are, that
we did not secure his release at an earlier date.

The several members of my family are all at home and join
me in kindest regards to you and Mrs. Lomax.

Sincerely,

Richard H. Kimball.

Mr. John A. Lomax
