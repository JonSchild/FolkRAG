One soilder who had been seen quite frequently 
at home on leave was asked how he
managed to get so many passes. He 
replied: aw man! I stay at home and 
furlough in the army, I've got my finger 
in the sarge's eye. 

An Organization of Colored people who were
acting as a U.S.O. Club for soilders were
displaying the double V campaign sign 
very prominently. One colored man
was asked what the sign represented 
He replied: It means that we're going
to mop up for the Japs over there and 
beat all of the Jim Crow out of you 
payers over here. Next day City officials
had the sign removed.
