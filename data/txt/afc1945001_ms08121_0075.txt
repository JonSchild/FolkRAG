A
Anecdote
Barney Ross gave up his fighting
to join the United States Marine
Corp. When he joined he had
dark brown hair. Just before
he left for Guadalcanal his hair
was still a dark brown. He was
there for six months. When
he came back to the United
States he had striks of gray
hair. He watched over his
wounded buddies and he killed
twenty-two Japs.
