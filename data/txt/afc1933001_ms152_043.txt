Evansville, Indiana

Dear Mrs. Bryant:

The programs beginning January 2 again will
continue until April 29. I am sending you, under
separate cover, a manual. I would love to use some of
your beautiful ballads on the air for the programs but
they are already overcrowded with material.

I will never forget your kindness and hospitality 
to myself and Elizabeth and whenever we are near Evansville
we will drop in to see you again. In the mean time give
my best regards and good wished you yourself and your charming
family.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
