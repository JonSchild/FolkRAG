that he was the royal-Bengayal
prize shit-ass of the universe,
a pee-wee, two-bit, example of 
the brainless nit-wits whose one preeminent
possession is brass, possessed in
such degree and acumen that
despite their sycophantic hypocrisy,
they get by in the world of music,
which at best, I think, possesses less
brains and real common horse sense
than any other profession.

Which, having said which,
"And my language is plain,"

I retire into the innocent
oblivion where i belong, being
only an humble devotee
of the beautiful and true - and despising
a liar.
