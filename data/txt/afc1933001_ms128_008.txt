Dear Mr. Thompson:

Thank you for your suggestions regarding
a portable machine. We are not in the market
for such a machine at the present moment, but
when we should be, we will give your model
every consideration. I am anxious to see the
specifications for the larger machine.

Very truly yours,

Acting Chief, Division of Music
