the bride - Colorful 
as all this was feeling 
was that it was the 
last time Young 
folks pampering their 
parents. Steve asleep 
under rosebush. John 
dancing polish not dance 
with youngest prettiest 
girl & then setting to 
to court the fattest 
old lady in the house. 
Very open, wicked, her 
little fat hands
