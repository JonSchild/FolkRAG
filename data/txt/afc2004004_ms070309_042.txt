laying there, never opened her
eyes, breathed normally - I wanted
to see what was she going to say.
  She rose triumphing, shouting and
praising the Lord - She was under

  Even today there are people that have
a praying ground. Under some particular
tree in the garden or in some place in
their room.
    I've always been privileged under
kind white people - I've never even
had a harsh word from them -

ladies she worked for maid
insisted on being waited on precisely
and were spoiled badly. Still are today!
I roomed in the house - didn’t live
In the yard with the servants - you can
tame a lion by love.
