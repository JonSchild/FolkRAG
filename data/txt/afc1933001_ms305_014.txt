Alan Lomax Will Journey on 'Own'

Folk Lorist Leaves on Expedition

Alan Lomax, son of John A. Lomax
of Austin, companion of his
father on many a jaunt through
little-traveled parts of the United
States in search of folk songs of
the negro race, will leave this week
for the West Indies, still on the
trail of folk music for the archives 
of American folk songs of the library
of congress.

Alan Lomax, who is just 21,
graduated in June from the University
of Texas.

He has had well-tutored experience
in work of the sort he is now
undertaking for himself.  In fact,
he has made one trip of his own,
having spent a summer in Georgia,
Florida and the Bahamas,
trailing down the folk music of
the negroes of those sections.

In 1933, while still a student in
the University of Texas, he made
the extensive tour with his father,
perhaps best known of all folk
song hunters and widely known authority
on cowboy songs of the
Southwest.  Mr. Lomax holds the
honorary position of consultant in
American folk song and curator of
the American folk song archives
of the library of congress.

Results of this trip were numerous
recordings now on file in the
library, and a book, "American
Ballads and Folk Songs," which
was published in 1934.

Later, on a grant from the Carnegie
foundation, the Lomaxes visited
prisons throughout the South
to record work songs of the colored
people.

In one southern prison they discovered
Lead Belly, the negro who
sang himself out of prison, accompanied
the Lomaxes on their
search for folk lore of his race
and created a sensation in New
York later when he sang publicly
there.

The two Lomaxes, father and
son, have compiled the songs collected
in their tour of southern
prisons in a book which they have
called "Negro Folk Songs as Sung
by Lead Belly," which is to appear
soon.

Should his present trip bear
worthwhile fruit, Mr. Lomax will
record unusual or startlingly different
songs and tales, on aluminum
discs which will be added to
the files in the library of congress.

Mr. Lomax believes the negro
songs of the West Indies are "probably
as nearly like those of Africa
as may be found on the western
hemisphere."  He is anxious to 
note in what ways they differ from
the negro folk songs of the United
States.

Already there are approximately
800 records collected by the Lomaxes
in the files of the congressional
library.  Mr. Lomax hopes
to add many to the number during
his visit to the West Indies.
He expects to return in March.
