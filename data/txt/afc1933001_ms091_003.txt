My brother and I are both
in the University. He will finish
this spring; I have 2 more
years. I may transfer to
Cornell next year.
    Lee is a lovely baby. He
will be a year old next
week. He is fat and jolly
like his grandfather, and has
curly yellow hair, unlike his
grandfather.
    Please do send us a delayed
Christmas greeting.
    Affectionately yours,
    Kate

allen was scheduled to appear, but
the rascal didn't show up. I was
very disappointed, because I have
pleasant memories of him. Is he
still in Washington? Is Bess
out of Bryn Mawr?
    Mother is very well, thank you.
She has a lame shoulder that 
prevents her from writing letters,
and a tricky heart that prevents
her from indulging in acrobatics,
but she is really quite well. She
asks to be remembered to you and
Mrs. Lomax.
    I bought one of Leadbelly's
records the other day - the Mornin'
Blues, I think it's called. Where
is he now? Is Martha still
with him? (I haven't any idea
you'll answer all these questions,
but we are interested, anyway.)
