That's wrong, I've gone wrong.
Lomax: Start again.
Cox: Eh?
So the whale bein' struck an' the line paid out,
An' he gave a dash with his tail.
He capsized the boat an' we lost five hands
And we did not catch that whale, brave boys,
And we did not catch that whale.

So bad news, bed news, to our captain did go,
When we've lost five jolly, jolly tars,
And the worst, we've lost our prentice boy,
And it grieves him more than all, brave boys,
And it grieved him more thand all.

So come weigh your anchor, my jolly tars,
For the winter star I see,
For it's time we should leave this cold counterey,
So from Greenland we bore away, brave boys,
So from Greenland we bore away.
Lomax: That's a smasher.
Cox: Eh?
Lomax: That's a smasher.
Cox: (laughs)
Lomax: It's a shame that songs like that are given up, isn't it,
Harry?
