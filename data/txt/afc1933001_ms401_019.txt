the streets.  At last the car stopped close to the grim, red building 
of Camp Number One at Parchman.  The days journey was done.  We
could see men in stripes lounging about the buildings.  "Feels sorta

            I was shown a comfortable room in Superintendent Thames' home.  
The negro boy in stripes who carried my baggage said after he had unpacked my valise, and as he turned down the bad covers, "I'll turn 
over the mattress in the morning and make you another sweet bed."
           Meanwhile Iron Head was lodged with the "head shooter," a 
tall black man.  In Mississippi only the trusties carry guns and guard their fellow convicts.  Late that night through my open window I heard a group of negro trusties singing,

                                   "Yonder comes Rosy 
                                     In her morning gown.

                                     How it do hang down."

The ex-bell hop who had shown me 
to my room the night before tapped at 
my door early and stuck his head
into the room.
              "Night's out!"  he announced.
Another day of adventure [???] on
 among Negroes whose gang songs 
are unexcelled.
