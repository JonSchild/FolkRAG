[*3 hrs*]

Mrs:  Well, it makes it more tender.

AL:   We're here in the kitchen of Mrs. Rogers of Ephasis (?), Georgia
      where she is getting   . . .  uh oh ! . .   (some kitchen accident?)
Technician:  Start that again?

From here, Mrs. Rogers begins singing:  ". . . . for a few minutes of 
        freedom. . .chanting the song. . . .  Columbia, the queen of the world. . . ."

AL:   Now what was the name of that?

MRS:   "Marilla's Lesson", yes, a very popular song.

AL:   Who was Marilla and what was his last name ?

MRS:   It's a very strange, I don't know,  . . .  I never figured it out,
           it's a very very old song and I don't know exactly what it means!

AL:   But it struck your fancy.

MRS:   Oh it's easy, and it's got a pretty tune.

AL:   You've been a Sacred Harper for many many years.

MRS:   It wouldn't do to say how many years!

AL:   Does it come down in your family?

MRS:   Oh yes, my father was singing school teacher and he, uh, sittin'
           round the fireside -- there wasn't no television then -- and he'd
           teach us songs, and later on I'd see those songs in the book and
           I had probably been saying some of the words wrong that I didn't
           realize!  . . .  til I saw it written down, then it amazed me, to see
           the words that I had not been saying right!   One song was "Go Preachers"
           and that was a song my daddy would sing "Go Preachers and tell it to
           the world". . .  and it said "true free grace" and  I thought it said
           "Two three grace" . . .  I found that out in the book.

AL:   What part do you sing?

MRS:   Well, I try to sing alto.   I started off as a little girl singing
