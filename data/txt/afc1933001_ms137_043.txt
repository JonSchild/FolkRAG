Mr. Alan Lomax
c/o General Delivery
Duluth, Minnesota

Dear Mr. Lomax:

It is not very easy to find people who can 
sing traditional Norwegian ballads, but I may be 
able to suggest one or two persons who could help
you out.  I shall turn the matter over in my mind,
and if I have any names to give you when you
arrive, it will be a pleasure to do so.
Sincerely yours, 
Theodore C. Blegen
Superintendent
