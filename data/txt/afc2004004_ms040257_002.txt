22. Bird sounds: 

"The thrush says this to her chick": 
Iain 'Ic 'Ille  Mhoire Bhig
Thig dhachaidh, thig dhachaidh
Ciod thuige, ciod thuige
Gu'd dhinneir, gu'd dhinneir;
Dé'n dinneir, dé'n dinneir?
Aran cruaidh cuirc [agus] coirce [*aran*]
Agus meog leis, agus meog leis
Bi clis, bi clis.

John, Son of little Mary
Come home, come home
What to, what to? 
To your dinner, to your dinner
What dinner, what dinner? 
Hard dry bread, oat bread
And whey with it, and whey with it
Be quick, be quick.

"All these birds speak in Gaelic, you know".
