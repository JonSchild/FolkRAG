ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream;
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
Life is but a dream.

Hoe, hoe, hoe your row,
Thro' the summer heat;
Merrily, do your bit,
Cheerily stick to it,
Raising beans and wheat.

Save, save, save the wheat,
Meat and sugar, too;
Corn and potatoes and rice and tomatoes
Are mighty good for you!


THE BELL DOTH TOLL

The bell doth toll,
It's echoes roll,
I know the sound full well;
I love it's ringing, 
For it calls to singing,
With it's bim, bim, bim, bom, bell,
Bim, bom, bim, bom, bell.


MERRILY, MERRILY

Merrily, merrily greet the morn:
Cheerily, cheerily sound the horn.
Hark! to the echoes, hear them play,
O'er hill and dale, and far away.


LOVELY EVENING

Oh, how lovely is the evening, is the evening,
When the bells are sweetly ringing, sweetly ringing!
Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong.
