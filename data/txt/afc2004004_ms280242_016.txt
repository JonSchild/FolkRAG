Davy: It's a very useful thing to learn. You could be standing
in a crowd and you wouldn't want nobody to know what you'd be
saying, and you could say, well. (He talks cant) - it means,
"Come away, lassie" - bennaree dilly is "come away." "Shan halter
in the kin" - means the people in the house is no  good. You dinna
want them to ken, to know what you're saying aboot them.
Lomax: Was there a time when the travelling people were treated
badly in Scotland? When they had to get this secret language for
themselves.
Davy: Well, I don't think that, no. The old cant and gammon, I
suppose it didn't really come from Scotland, as Hamish was telling
me. Mostly it comes from some foreign country or something. Italian
I suppose are the real English gipsy. You get gipsies in England
in the present day, and they don't belong to this country at all.
They're dark-skinned people. No, no, the people in Scotland wasna
treated badly at all.
Lomax: Are there still berklers in Scotlands do you think?
Davy: No, not now. There's too much medical practice now. Too
much doctos. Know everything. Doctors can take out your heart and 
put it back in again. In that days they couldn't do nothing like 
that.  Even if you had an abscess, they couldn't cure an abcess.
They just used to haul your teeth right out. Different ways of
doing things now.
