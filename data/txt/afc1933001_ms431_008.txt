THE PICKET LINE
(Tune: Pollywollydoodle)

The Union is the Place for me, the place for working girls
Who want some time to sing and play, and money we can spend.

CHORUS

On the line, on the line, on the picket, picket line,
We'll  win our fight, our fight for the right,
On the picket, picket line.

I am a Union girl because I want a living wage.
We'll stick together, we'll fight together,
We'll get that living wage.

(Chorus)

Oh the man who scabs is the man who's yellow,
And is a sight to see.
We'll kick him out, we'll keep him out,
With the picket, picket line.

(Chorus)

WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
(Tune: I shall Not Be Moved)

We shall not be, we shall not be moved,
We shall not be, we shall not be moved,
Just like a tree that's planted by the water,
We shall not be moved.

We're backed up by the Union,
We shall not be moved,
We're backed up by the Union,
We shall not be moved.

(Chorus)

We're striking for our freedom, etc.

(Chorus)

We're fighting for our children, etc.

(Chorus)
