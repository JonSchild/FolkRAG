VINEYARD SHORE

(Tune: "Londonderry or Danny Boy")


Where maples grow and fir trees climb the rocky ledge,
Where waters shine in pool and mountain stream,
Beside a road that follows a blue river's edge
Stands Vineyard Shore, a home, a school, a dream,
Oh Vineyard Shore! Send courage out to all who need!
Let right increase and justice be installed!
Till life is strong, by powers of joy and knowledge freed,
So, Vineyard Shore, your dream may be fulfilled, fulfilled.


What dreams may grow, as young vines planted in the spring,
Their roots thrust down in deepest soil of truth,
Till workers all the fruits of understanding bring,
Borne from our borders in the hands of youth.
Oh Vineyard Shore! Send courage out to all who need!
Let right increase and justice be instilled!
Till life is strong, by powers of joy and knowledge freed,
So, Vineyard Shore, your dream may be fulfilled, fulfilled.
