more interesting material, but this must be stylistically consonant
with the old for you to accept it.  There is no reason in the
world why John and Bessie and the group cannot learn to under-
stand the levels of authenticity and the time depth that their mater-
ial represents.  This will protect them from becoming acculturated
any more rapidly than will happen in the normal course of things.
I think you should do everything possible to push John to be more
of a leader of the group in terms of decisions about dates, fin-
ances, etc.  I also think that Bessie should not do all the
MCing, because she is apparently talking more and more, and this
is one of the chief barriers between the group and their public.
I suspect that Henry would make a good, quiet announcer of tunes,
and I suggest that you try him out at this for some of the smaller
dates.
I am going right now to a meeting about a Negro folk touring
company to go to Europe following the successful heels of the
"Black Nativity" group.  If this works out, I think it is going
to furnish a long period of employment for Bessie and other Negro
artists.
Please forgive the unbrotherly tone of this letter, but I am
making it all business -- personal affairs during the next few
days.  Our house is now big enough to accommodate one or two
more Lomaxes at a time, and we would love to hear from you all.
The home address is 361 West 18th Street.
Much love to you all,
