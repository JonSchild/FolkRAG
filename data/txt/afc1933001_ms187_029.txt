Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Please be kind enough to give my "plan for
work" to Mr. Goodschild, inasmuch as I do not know what
address to write to him at.

I regret that I was not able to send it
sooner, but I have been pretty busy. Within the next few
days, I will send you the project of the Czechoslovak war,
military and patriotic songs in their relation to the new
situation.

I believe that I will be able to come to
the Music Division within the next ten days, to continue
working on the Slav folksongs.  I met Mrs. Comhaire; she
told me she is very enthused about your recordings on
Haiti, much the same as I am about your Polish folksongs
and music.

with many thanks for your cooperation, I am

Sincerely yours,

[*Svatava Jakobson*]
