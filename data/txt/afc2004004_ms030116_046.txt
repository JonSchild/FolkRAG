Mind how we do things cause God has said, my friends, "You shall be warned
of judgment."  An in my conclusion, let us learn to be honest an not find
ouwahselves with anything that don't belong to us.  An when the time come
for us to stand before God in judgment we can meet God with a clear conscience
an we won't be tremblin when he come down to judge the world.  God bless you.
May God hep you.
Eliz:  That was a beautiful sermon.
Mrs. D:  mm-hmmm.
Johnny:  (solemn awe)  I was gonna say:  That sermon has a beginnin, a middle,
and an end.  It's a perfect as a poem.  Time will take care of everthang.
The women squabblin over their chile.
Rev. D:  Time will take care of everything. . .A moment ago I tole you
nobody can't do nothin with you when you git the Holy Spirit.  You're 
humbled, chile, when you git the Holy Spirit.  You ain't gon hurt nobody.
Eliz:  Have you ever heard of anybody in church claiming they had the Holy
Spirit and then hurting somebody?
Rev. D:  (Shouting)  I heard of em might-nigh killin each other.  Said they had the Holy
Ghost.  An old woman in church one time got to shoutin.  She stepped on
another woman's foot.  She had all the corns I reckon in the world on huh
feet.   The woman weighed two hundred.  She stretched out huh hell an throwed
huh right up in the pulpit.  That woman couldn't hep it though cause she
step on every corn she had.  Couldn't hep it.  Look like she waited till she
got where that woman was to step on huh toes.
Eliz:  You think she might have done it on purpose?
Rev. D:  (Shouting)  She didn't have no use for the woman thoug h.  She didn't like huh.
It happened that night.  She's was gon shout it out -- couldn't fit it out.
They fell out about a man, I think it was.
(We laugh)
Johnny:  (sententiously)  A lot of women will.
