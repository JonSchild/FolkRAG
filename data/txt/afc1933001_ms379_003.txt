[De white] folks hab somethin' dey call a [close up] closed up season, an' you
you [got to be mighty careful] don' know when you can eat duck an' when you can't. So when I hit de hill an' [tied]

under my jumper. [Dese] Four duck, Two brace [. Dey'll] what would jest
buy a little Christmas fo' dem chillun, an' gib Cindy her shoe,
an'fill my pipe with [terbacco] tobacco. An' by dat time I sho been
ready to light up dat pipe, it was so cold, [de win' was blowin' so cold] an' de wind a-blowin'.

[And den] I meets up wid Eight Eye Swinton. His real name been [Bill Swinton] John Henry, but us give dat basket name to him.

"Eight Eye, I got [ten] four little duck here dis mornin',
an' de folks ain't got up yit to de house where I usually
place my duck, so de cook ain't take em. Where can I git
rid of dese duck?"
An' [Bill] Eight Eye say, 
"See dat same house yonder?"
