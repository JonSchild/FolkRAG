Eppie Morrie:
1) @ 4 and 20 hieland men came frae the Carron side
To steal awa' Eppie Morrie for she wadna be a bride, a bride,
She wadna be a bride.
2) Then oot it came her mother, it was a moonlicht night,
She couldna see her dochter for the waters shone sae bricht.
3) "Haud awa' frae me, mither, haud awa' frae me.
There's nae a man in all Strathdon shall married be with me."
4) They've taken Eppie Morrie then and a horse they've bound her on,
And they have rid o'er Carron side as fast as horse could gang.
