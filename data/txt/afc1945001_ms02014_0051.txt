TO:              William H. Webber                                     DATE:  10-20-42
FROM:        Field Representative - Texas
SUBJECT:    Availability of Rumor Collectors for Future Studies

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

            As requested in your memo of October 3, there is listed below 
the names, addresses and reactions of persons who have cooperated 
with us in rumor collections:

Dr. Frank Gullette - Dentist
Norwood Building
Austin, Texas

            Considered collecting rumors interesting, and willing to
cooperate as far as possible. Suggested, however, that the services
of another dentist be enlisted since his practice is to  heavy to allow 
much time for collecting and classifying rumors.

Victor Cluck - Chamber of Commerce Official
Chamber of Commerce Building
Austin, Texas

            Enthusiastic over collecting rumors and willing to cooperate
to the fullest extent.  Thinks that rumors should be collected for a 
specified week from time to time.

Frances Thompson - Beauty Parlor Owner and Operator

            Extremely interested in rumor collecting and willing to continue,
preferably for specified week from time to time.

Sam McDonald - Labor Union Official
1010 West 24th Street
Austin, Texas

            (Has not been available for contact since the writing of last 
rumor report. Will get in touch with him as soon as possible.)
