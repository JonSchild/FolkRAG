Dear Dr. Beck:

As you doubtless know, I came to Mt. Pleasant last
August shortly after you had left on your Nebraska vacation
and not having found you at home to my very great
disappointment, I made inquiries, found a couple of your
best singers and recorded several of their best songs for
the Archive. I did the recording with this reservation
clearly in mind - that after I returned to Washington, I
would write you and place these records at your disposal
and deposit them in the Archive with whatever restrictions
you cared to impose. I can prepare and send to you, if you
like, a list of the songs and fragments of songs that Bill
McBridg and the others gave me and if you would like to
have copies of the same, that can be arranged too.

My trip in Michigan was full of a great many fruitful
surprises. Among these was my discovery that there
are still a great number of lumberjack singers in the
state with good voices and healthy memories. It is extremely
important that these singers and their songs be
recorded before it is too late and since you have already
done such extensive work in the study of lumberjack ballads
in Michigan, I feel that you are the person who
ought, if you are interested, to do the job. The Archive
of American Folk-Song desires to give as much help to
competent collectors as possible and therefore it may be
possible to arrange for you to use one of our portable
electric recording machines for a period or to send a
machine and an operator to Michigan to work under your
supervision.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
