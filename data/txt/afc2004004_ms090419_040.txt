Fisk, 8. 11. BUCH ASA.
"Lord, John ain't here." Say, "Well, you'll do; I'll take you 
along." She say, "Come out from the bed, John." Say, "Come out from 
that bed."
[So] Well, John come out from under the bed and lit out the back door running, 
bare feet, you know. She said, "Lord, yonder goes John out across 
that field, back of the house." So the Lord got in behind [him] --right across 
the field him and his old marse went, you know. The old lady set in 
the back door [akimbo] and kimboed and watched John gettingnear [back] bout of the woods. 
Left the Lord, as she called, way behind. She called him, she say, 
"Oh Lord, Lord, Oh Lord." Say, "you can't catch John cause John bar-
footed."
