You Don' Know My Mind 

Notes: 

Worked last summer, 
Worked part of the fall, 
Come home an' took my Christmas in my overalls. 

Yonder come a woman got great big legs, 
Walkin' like she's walkin' on soft-boiled eggs. 

Can't back no wheeler, can't shake no plow, 
But I can do anything if you show me how. 

You mus' think my heart is made of stone, 
I took you in, baby, when you didn' have no home.
