Dear Mr. Lomax,
Please tell me if there are any
books published in the United States that 
contain folk music and dances of the 
following peoples:

        Tahitians
[*x*]Fijians
        Samoans
[*x*]Maoris

I am particularly interested in obtaining 
material containing the dance movements
with their accompanying music and words.

I shall appreciate any assistance
that you can give me. 
Yours truly,
[Miss] Elsie J. Kennedy
