2nd Reel of 10/12/61, Song 12                                           [*38*]

                                      GO ON, I'LL GO WITH YOU

CHORUS:            Go on,
                            I'll go with you,
                            Open your mouth,
                            An' I'll speak for you,
                            But, Lord, if I go
                            And tell 'em what you said,
                            They won't believe in me.

                            (REPEAT CHORUS)

                            Lord, you give me a home,
                            You told me to stay,
                            You give me a ticket
                            And you told me to go.                            (CHORUS)

                            Lord, you give me a book
                            And you told me to read,
                            You give me your mind
                            And You told me to be it.                            (CHORUS)

                            Yes, I've got a book,
                            The Bible, too,
                            I can read
                            As well as you.                                           (CHORUS)

                            He told Moses to go on,  (CONTINUE CHORUS)

                            He told Nora to go on,  (CONTINUE CHORUS)
