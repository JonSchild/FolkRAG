me.  I'm just, I'm just afraid I got to slip to leave them.
TL:  What?
BJ:  If I wanna leave 'em, I'm afraid I have to slip off an' leave
them.  That's the way I always have been, ya know?  I never have
been doubted, not never have been doubted, in that...I was
doubted in, ah, well, like, "If I wanna git rid of ya, how will I
git rid of ya?"  'Cause I, I, I tried to treat 'em that way.  You
see?  You just, ah, live right an' do right to 'em.  I don't care
how nasty they are, they know when you're treatin' 'em right.  I
don't care how dirty they are, they know right treatment.  I don't
care who a man is, he want's a good woman.  I don't care how nasty
he is or how much a drunkard he is in the street, he [give] git out with
this woman an' that woman an' drink an' clown, he, for hisse'f
want a good one.  I don't know why, but they are that way.  They
want a good one.  They may git wich you an' drink an' [fly all] flop about
an' do everything.  That's why, that's why I said, an'...
TL:  Is that all a man wants out of a woman, is for a woman to be
good and that's all?
BJ:  Well, ta, ta be good to him, for him's sake; he, he wants ya
to be good.
TL:  Take care of him and...
BJ:  That's right.  An' be good to him.  See.  An' if -- An' you
want him to be good to you, a co'se.  So that's just way it goes.
An' a, but, the point thing is about it is to prove yourself, see.
That's all, is to prove that that's what, that's the reason I say I
was always afraid that I ha-- that I couldn't git rid a them .  'Cause
I runnin' away to prove myself.  Day an' night, anywhere they see
me, see?  Among the company or among the, where I [belong] go along at, I
prove my self.
     An' a woman, I don't trust nary a woman under Heaven,
