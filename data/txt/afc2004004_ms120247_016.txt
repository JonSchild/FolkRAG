I'm going to look at the middle post to see 
if I will be fed, 
They don't want me today 
But they will want me tomorrow,
I'm going to look at the middle post to see if 
I will be fed. 

The next song concerned the mombo, Theoline Marseille, and was led by Avacelia

(52B2(        A Yen Valou
M'ape mande cote Theoline Marseille 
Nou' la-e, Sobo, nou' la-e 
Adamisou, nou' la, n'ape garde, 
Nou' la-e, Sobo, nou' la-e 
I ask you where is Theoline Marseille 
There you are, Sobo, there you are, 
Adamisou, there you are, watching 
There  you are, Sobo, there you are. 
See Over      
  I was told that the following song was not Guinea, 
that is not handed down from in tradition nor yet coming from 
the mouth of a [person] possessed person inspired to sing by the 
Gods (and this for the Vaudouist is the same as a traditional 
heritage, since the gods are Guinea gods and sing the old 
songs, the best songs being the oldest), but was composed by a 
servitor.
(52B3)
Ago, ago, con' ca ou ye,
Ago, ago, Judas-yo nomme nom moin,
(or)
(Ago, ago, Judas-yo parle sous moin,)
M' pas t'a la, yo parle sous moin,
M' pas t'a la, yo parle sous moin,
Ago, ago, Judas-yo parle sous moin.

Look, thus they are,
Look, the Judases name my name,
(or)
Look, the Judases gossip about me,
When I am not there, they gossip about me,
