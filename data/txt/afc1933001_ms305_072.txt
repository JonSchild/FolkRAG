Galax Entertainers Heard
On School of Air Program

Hill-Billy Songs and Stories Go Out Over Columbia
Network From Studios of WDBJ-Broadcast
Will Be Repeated in Afternoon

Roanoke's station WDBJ went on
the air over half the nation this
morning as five mountaineers, tapping
their feet to a man, for half
an hour played and sang hill-billy
songs and told stories from the
Southwest Virginia mountains.

Under the direction of Columbia's
American School of the Air expert,
Alan Lomax, the "Bog Trotters,"
of Galax, equipped with two
violins, banjo, guitar and auto-harp,
plus versatile mountaineer voices,
gave their interpretations of "Cindy,"
"Hop Up, My Ladies," "Foxchase'
(banjo and guitar), "Western
Country or Suzannah Gal,'
"Fortune" (a reel), "Old Joe Clark,"
"Arkansas Traveller,' and Cackling
Hen."

The "Bog Trotters' were on the
air this morning between 9:15 and
9:45 o'clock for the eastern and
central part of the nation and this
afternoon, 3:35 to 4 o'clock, they
will again broadcast over WDBJ
to the west.

Eleventh of Series

Given as the eleventh of the
American School of the Air series
on folk music, the program affords
school children over the nation an
insight into the entertainment of
mountaineers in the southwest of
Virginia and similar sections. Uncle
Alec Dunford, Dr. W. P. Davis, and
the Ward family (Uncle Crockett,
Fields, and Wade), presented some
of the finest square dance tunes
interspersed with typical hill-billy
stories.

The local studios yesterday were
busy all day long with preparing
and rehearsing for the broadcast,
biggest network job ever undertaken
here. William Fineshriber, Columbia's
director of the Folk Music of 
American series on the air school,
is here to produce the show, and
the nation will be by Paul
Reynolds, studio director and announcer
of WDBJ, that "Today's
program was produced and directed
by William Fineshriber in collaboration 
with Jack Weldon, program
director of WDBJ." Mr. Reynolds
also has assisted with the
production of the program, and will
handle the announcing.

Lomax, folk musician for the CBS
series and assistant in charge of
the Archive of American Folk Music
of the Library of Congress, is commentator
on the program.

The folk music series has proved
one of the most successful on the
School of the Air, with highly 
encouraging comments in letters
from children and their teachers,
Mr. Fineshriber said last night.

On most of the broadcasts in the
series, a brief symphonic composition
based on some folk tune is
played by the Columbia Symphony
orchestra, though none is to be used
on the program today. This is
designed to give children a "gentle
introduction to the horrors of the
symphony," Mr. Fineshriber said,
teaching them to look for the themes
in symphonic compositions, and in
this has been gratifyingly successful,
he indicated.
