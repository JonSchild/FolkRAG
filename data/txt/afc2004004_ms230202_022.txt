BLUES - 19

SID:  B'cause that cuts off an' it leaves a ridge about, I'd say, two or
three inches.
NACHEZ:  (THEY ARE BOTH ABSORBED NOW IN DISCUSSING THE TOOLS THEY ONCE USED.  THEY
ARE WORKERS, FIRST AND FOREMOST)  Well, what about the middle- buster?
SID:  Well, that's the thing. . after you use the gee-whiz an' throw that stuff
in the middle, then the middle-buster comes down an' bustes that middle
out an' throws it back up.  An' then, again, they use the middle-buster for
the. .for the cul'ivation-uh. .for fixin' it for cul'ivation.  That's in the
time when after the crop is gathered, then they break up the lan'; then they
got the-thuh-the tu'nin' plow to go along. .
NACHEZ:  You use that before you use the middle-buster, don' you?
SID:  Yeah, yeah-the tu'nin' plow goes along an' cuts off half of the row on one
side then comes back on the other side an' cut the other half off.  Then
the middle-buster goes down an' takes that middle out.
NACHEZ:  In other words the middle-buster lays the rows. . down . .
SID:  That's right.
