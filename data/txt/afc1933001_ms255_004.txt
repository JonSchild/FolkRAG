Took Sal to de party-o- 

Sugar in de ground, ground on de ground, 
Went to get de sugar out roll de ground around. 

I went down to Sally's house 
to take her out to de party 
we got to de gate and de gate was locked 
and dat started up de party 

I don't care where Sally goes 
Just so I can her to de party-o  
I take Sal an' you take Sue 
They aint no difference between 
de two 

I
[?] as I can my new house done 
Goin to build my chimney higher
So all de folks round here wont know
When I am buildin de fire
