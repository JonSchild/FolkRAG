Dear Friend,
The enclosed check is your payment 
for singing on "I Wisht I Was in
Heaven" and "Little Sally Walker."
These two songs are going to be 
released on a record, with some
others that your group recorded
for me, by Prestige recording company. 
The series will come out
before Christmas, and one record
will be sent to the leader of the
group so that you can get together
and hear yourselves singing on
the record.
My best regards to you and all my
friends in Como.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
