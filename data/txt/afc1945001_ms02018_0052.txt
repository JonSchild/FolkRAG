Report on Rumors - 2

Selective Service

1.  It is inevitable that 18 and 19 year-old boys be drafted but 
the Administration is afraid to do anything about it until after the 
election.  (Outstanding lawyer with wide contacts and many civic 
activities.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
2.  Married men, some of whom have children, are being drafted 
when young men without dependents are not being taken.  (This was heard 
in practically the same form four different times.  (1)  Married man with 
working wife.  Phoenix, 8-8-42.  (2)  Married man with wife capable of 
working.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.  (3)  Unmarried man with dependent sister.  
Phoenix, 8-14-42.  (4)  Married man with wife who works part-time.  
Phoenix, 8-14-42.)
3.  The Government promised us long ago and again recently that men 
with dependents would not have to go until all others had been taken.  
But my husband is having to go and we have three children, aged 9, 10 and 
11 years.  And I have several friends who have smaller children whose 
husbands are being taken.  We feel that the Government is double-crossing 
us.  (Waitress.  Phoenix, 8-15-42.)
