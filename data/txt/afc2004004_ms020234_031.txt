BJ TAPE 20, p. 28

Didn't know this boy had come home.  Then he called for 'im an'
everything an' tol' 'im to call 'is maids, [an'] servants around an'
tol' 'em to kill the fattest calf they had.  That means they [was] would
prepar[in for a]e a big meal.  An' they did.  An' they had -- Then they
call for [t]his, for [t]his friends around, to come home and make
merry with 'im.  "Cause he['s] was so glad he had come back, his son
had come home.
        An' then, an' they gathered around.  They had a big band,
a big, big, [a big] dance, I'd say.  An' they all, all made merry; they
[an'] eat.  An' this other son, that stayed home, he puffed up.  He
got angry.  An' jus' went an' told his father that he'd been with
him all these years.  He never did pick -- take his stuff an'
leave.  He never did leave notime, ya see?  "An' now, " he say,  "You
never give me a [piece] feast, an, an, this's my brother, left thee, an'
went away an' spent all his money.  An' now he come home an' you
give him a feast."
         Then his father had to tell 'im, show it to 'im.  Said, said
"Your brother had been...dead!  Jus' as good as," said, "Dead."
You know, didn't die or anything; he was without.  Without, you
dead, you know?  "You, your brother has been, been gone
away and went down to nothin'.  An' he lost -- An' den he [met]
made up his mind that, before he would die, there, starvation
field, he would  come home..  An' you should be glad of it."
         But the other brother was s-- was, was puffed up.  "You never
give me a feast.  I never left ya.  I always stayed chere witcha!"
Hah, you see!  He didn't mean anything, (?) but yet an' still
the brother didn' see into it until the father told him about it,
see.  "Cause he was really puffed up.  An' so he wouldn't -- 'Cause
his brother had left.
