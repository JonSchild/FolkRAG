GRUZLEWSKI, DOROTHY   A
Rumers
1. I heard over the radio that 
Hitler is supposed to be suffering 
with some kind of brain 
trouble. I wish it were true for 
everybodies sake as well as mine.

2. There is a rumer around the 
school and inside as well, that 
the students will be getting 
out early because of the war 
and that the boys will have 
to go to war.

3. The late dispatch from Washington 
over the radio said that starting 
April 1st meat, can fish and possibly 
cheese will be rationed.
