Reporters selected for the rumor project should be reliable 
and intelligent. They should not be chosen simply because 
of their expressed interest. While it is probably all right (sic) to 
announce that reporters are being chosen[* how many?*], the major recruitment

his opportunities to overhear rumors. Frequently, there is a 
strong tendency to build up a large staff of reporters on the 
assumption that because only some of them will function properly, 
the larger the dragnet the better the results. While there may be

when they are not individually selected, the wasted effort in 
training people who are not originally good material, all would 
suggest that staffs be developed slowly and carefully.[* nuts*]

center of a conversation and would therefore have difficulty in
