Dorothea Baykin    Mar. 15, 1943

English

A very scared young boy was running away from
the front lines as fast as possible. A captain stopped
him and asked, "Where are you running?"
"The young boy, who was a private, replied" "Don't stop
me now, boss, move."
The captain: "Do you realize who I am?"
Private: "No, who are you?"
Captain: "I'm a Captain."
Private: "You're a liar"
Captain: "I beg your pardon" (very indignantly)
The private looked up to see just who this was
detaining him, and much to his surprise found out 
he really was a captain.  Being flabbergasted the private
said, " Oh, you are a Captain."
The Captain replied, "Yes, aren't you ashamed?"
Private: "Heck no, I didn't know I could run 
so fast."
Captain; "How do you mean?"
Private: " Well, I must be almost back to camp
to pass an officer."
