Wee O'Hara:
As I came doon through Glasga toon I met wi' Wee O'Hara,
I gie'd him a lick o' my Dundee rock, he gie me a hurl in his barren
And noo the bonny wee barrow's mine, it doesna belong to Wee O'hara
The fly wee bloke he stuck to my rock, so I'm sticking to his barrow.

Dum-a-dee-a-di-do,
Dum-a-dee-a-daddy-o,
There's a babby in the house
And I'm his mammy-o.
2)  And [I'm] yon's his daddy-o.
