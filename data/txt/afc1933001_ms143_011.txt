Gentlemen: 
I am making a study of Amish hymns and hymn tunes and have an 
opportunity to make some original recordings among the Amish 
in Iowa during the first week of April. Would it be possible 
for me to secure the loan of one of your recording machines to 
do this works? 
I am willing, of course, to observe whatever rules you have 
drawn up for such loans and for the disposition of records made 
during the recording. In order to secure the cooperation of 
the Amish groups in Iowa to make these recordings, I must give 
them absolute assurance that the recordings will not be 
commercialized or played over the radio. 
Sincerely yours, 
John Umble
