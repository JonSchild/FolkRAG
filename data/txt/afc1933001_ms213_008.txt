Clair and Dick Fleming about other 
matters I have told them your 
address. Should they phone you, 
please be especially nice to each of 
them. I have no better friends.

I wrote Macmillians that the 
Oxford [?] people in Light [?] 
had stolen without our permission 
eleven songs. That was a month 
ago. No reply has come. They 
hold the copyright. If you could 
punch them up, you might wangle 
#50 or so from that bunch 
of highbinders. I addressed my 
letter to Macmillan Pub. Co. I don't 
Know who handles such matters.

Johnny's address is 1044 
Davenport Hotel, Spokane, Wash.

Good luck.

Lovingly,

Father
