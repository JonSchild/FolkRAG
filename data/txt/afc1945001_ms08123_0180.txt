Gas and Oil
For the operation of
thousands and thousands 
of tanks, planes, and motor
trucks, gasline and oil
are very necessary. It is
plain to see that unless 
some restriction was
put on these products,
the fighting forces would
have to do without them.
This would be a drawback
in our fight for
freedom. The people of
America should be willing 
to give up their 
pleasure driving in order 
that our fighting forces
may fight a successful
war against the Axis.
