the quiet stars in the darkness of the night they often sang songs.
Sometimes they sang to quiet the cattle when they were restless, for
it had been found that the singing voice had a wonderful influence
over the restless and frightened animals traveling in a region that
was strange to them.  So long as the cattle could hear some voice
crooning a cattle lullaby they had no fear of the howl of the wolves
or the scream of a Mexican lion or any of the sudden noises of the 
night.  So they were soothed to sleep and soothed after they were 
asleep by what the cowboys called dogie songs.  Never a rain storm
at night but that all the band of cowboys were rousted from their beds to "talk"
to the cattle and many a stampede was stopped by singing to the dogies.
I used to lie awake at night and hear the cowboys, only a
short distance away on the prairie, singing to the cattle. Many a
time I have gone to sleep with this music, soft and lonely, lulling
me to slumber. Soon I began to pick up the words and also sing these
songs. I learned other words and tunes from the sons of neighbors
older than myself who each year went out on the round-ups and up the 
trail to Kansas. When they came back home to Bosque County to spend
the winter they brought with them new songs with became current in
our community.
As a freshman student to the University of Texas, I took
along with me in my trunk a little manuscript roll of cowboy songs.
One day I showed them to [my] a somewhat startled English Professor, a Johns Hopkins
doctor of philosophy, learned in the lore of Beowulf, in the hope that he might find merit in them.
