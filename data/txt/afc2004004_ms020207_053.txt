Reverend Roe. Reel 11. P. 4
done me lots of good. I had a doctor for me and paid out a lot of 
money on my kidneys, and he didn't give me any good until I got the old 
remedies and went to taking it, and I [was just] got me all right; I haven't 
been bothered any, you know, since. I found out, you know, what they 
[*They were good*]
would keep me healthy, the they would do me good, and I just keeps 
em and keeps using em; I uses em now. 
A: Have you cured many other people?
R: Thousands of peo le, I've cured
A: [And] I suppose that's helped you very much in your church work.
[*Roe cures people*]
R: Oh yeah. They call me from all over the city now. I won't go out; 
I tell em I'm too old to go running around. [I tell em] If they come 
over, I'll fix em u p [with] somepin, just some tea, you know. But I can't charge, 
you know, if the people give me anything, cause they'd put me in 
jail. But I guess I do em lots of good -- they all say so -- cause 
lots of em they go to the doctors and they don't get any better, they come 
to me and I fix it for em, and they come back [tomorrow morning] & tell me "Well, I'm all right." Some-
time they give me something. Sometimes a long time afterward, they may
give me a present of some kind or may be some money. And I8ve stopped the high blood
pressure, [oh, of just lots] on just 1000's of people. And I started telling you about 
[the shoe boy] Shug over here on Sherman Street, but I stopped. He [went] was sent home to 
die, and a fellow came after me, he just believed I could [cure] [cyove?] him. And I  
went over and I give him some herb-medicine and then I give him a stuff 
that I make up to put on to just [a] to rub[bing stuff] yourself you know. And it soon stopped 
those scales [cured him] from cumulating, and he went down, he was [a swooning] swollen oh just up
so['s] he couldn't pass his clothes on him. It all went down, and he 
got up, and the old white man that he rented from, after they had give 
him up to die, you know, he thought this boy soon'll wold be gone, he just 
[wouldn't] as well put him out, he come by one evening and so he had got up then 
and walked out in the yard. And he asked what had happened to him & he told him to [tel] him what I had 
done for him. And he went over there 'cross the creek and told folks.
