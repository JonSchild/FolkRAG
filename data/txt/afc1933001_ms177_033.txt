Mr. Fletcher Collins
Route 4
Burlington, N.C.

Dear Fletcher:
   
           Harold Spivacke has asked me to
obtain from you a curriculum vitae, one
page in length. By this he means to say 
that he wants a brief life history, with 
particular emphasis on how many pounds
you weighed when you were a baby and on
your career in community recreation work.

           He says he is quite serious. So, 
indeed, am I.
    
                     Best regards,
          
                    Alan Lomax
                        Assistant in Charge
