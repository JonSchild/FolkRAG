A few more days, or years, at most;
     My trials will be o'er;
I hope to joint the heavenly host
     On that eternal shore;
My raptured soul shall drink and feast
     In love's unbouded sea;
The glorious hope of endless rest
     Is ravishing me.

O, come, my Savior, come away,
     And bear me through the sky,
Nor let Thy chariot wheels delay-
     Make haste and bring it nigh;
I hope to see Thy glorious face
     And in Thy image shine,
To triumph in victorious grace,
     And be forever Thine.

No. 56

There was a little family lived up in Bethany,
Two sisters and a brother composed this family.
With prayer and with singing, like angels in the sky,
At morning and at evening they raised their voices high.

They lived in peace and pleasure for many lonely years,
And laid away their treasurer beyond this vale of tears;
Though poor and without money, their kindness made amends;
Their house was ever open to Jesus and His friends.

Although they lived so happy, so kind, so pure and good,
Their brother was afflicted, and by it thrown in bed.
