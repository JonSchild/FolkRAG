The Old Chisholm Trail

Most famous of all cattle routes that led from the region 
around San Antonio, Texas, to Abilene, and Fort Dodge, Kansas, was the 
Old Chisholm Trail. Along its winding paths poured northward, between 
1866 and 1890, a million Texas mustangs and twelve millions of Texas 
longhorn cattle, a breed now extinct as the dodo, except perhaps in 
some remote canyons of Old Mexico.

Driving these longhorns gave work to the cowboy, and the lonely 
trail life bred his songs. By far the longest and one of the best known 
is the ballad of The Old Chisholm Trail. I have several hundred stanzas 
in my collection. Every singing cowboy has something to add. For in its 
entirety this song describes the experiences possible on a cattle drive 
between Texas and Kansas. It is as long and real as the trail itself. 
One cowboy, after singing 72 stanzas to me, said he had only just well 
started. Unfortunately few stanzas may be printed. The cowboy was plain 
spoken and his material was unrefined "collops out from the rump of nature."
Such a song as the Chisholm Trail ballad found a home throughout the thinly 
settled region that stretched from Texas to the Dakotas and Montana where 
the longhorns were sometimes driven to be fattened, their flesh hardened 
and sweetened before they were shipped east to market. In my search for 
western songs I found stanzas of this ballad in every state west of the 
Mississippi River. The Texas cowboys scattered them as they went up the 
trail or drove the  ponyyard  back home when the cattle had finally been sold.

The song's movement is akin to the rapid gallop of a horse; the 
refrain suitable for a group to roar out as the cowboys sat in a circle
