Nashville, Tennessee

Dear Mr. McDaniel:

   I have never written to you to thank you for your
kind letter of July 21st.  The expedition left shortly
thereafter and went first only as far as Knoxville.
There we chose the community of Blairsville, Georgia,
as one being actively affected by TVA and here we
recorded enough material for two or three documentary
radio programs.

   I am very sorry I missed talking with you and
looking through the Writers' Project files.  I shall
however, be in Nashville within the next two or three
weeks and shall come and call on you.  In the meantime,
I hope you will accept my apologies for not having
written you sooner.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
