I'm jest de architect an' I'm gradin' dis road
For my Father's chillun to pass along.
I'm hoeing a grassy row in dis ol' worl'
An' I must be baptized.'
So ol' John baptized him while de angels watched.
An' church, I know, Yes, I do know,
When ol' Death tie his black hoss to my gate,
Come a-stealin' into my house on his velvet slippers,
An' pull down de shades of darkness in my room,
De same One dat walk 72 miles dat mornin'
Is goin' to be sittin' on my bedside den;
He goin' to say, 'Death, onloose his heart-strings gently;
I told him I'd be his dyin' bedmaker,
An' I want you to let him die easy.
He's my Father's chile, Death, an' befo' very long
Me an' him's goin' a-trippin' down to ol' Jurden agin.'

"Church, hit's a fine thing to be baptized. I'm
glad dat de Lord seen fit to call on me to do dis job
here on earth. So as dese young folks come out here and
are baptized today, remember that God is pleased. No
doubt dey have all swam in dis pool many times, but today,
the spirit of the Lord is hoverin' over it an'
makin' its waters holy."

The candidates were escorted out into the pond,
one at a time, by the two deacons[,] and Rev. Reese baptized
them. The services ended with the spiritual,
"It's de Ol' Ship of Zion", sung low.
