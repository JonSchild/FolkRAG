B

When I was new but sweet sixteen
     In beauty jist in bloomin' O
O little little did I think
     At nineteen I'd be greetin' O.

For the plooman lads, they're gey weel lads,
     They're false and deceivin' O
They sail awa and they gang awa
     And they leave their lassies greetin' O.

For if I had 'a kent what I dae ken
     And teen my mither's biddin' O
For I widnae be sittin' at your fireside,
     Cryin' hishy-ba my bairnie O

O hishy-ba, O I'm your ma
     But the Lord knows wha's your daddie O--
But I'll tak good care, and I'll be aware
     Of the young men in the gloamin' O.

Allegro Modto
When I was new but sweet sixteeen in beauty jist in bloomin' O, Oh
little little did I think at nineteen I'd be greetin' O, for the 
ploomen lads, they're gey weel lads, they're false and deceivin' O. They 
sail awa', and they gang awa and they leave their lassies greetin' O.

in the Pole Inn, Glenlivet, in March 1956.  Alec's title is "Mary
on the Banks o'Spey"; his text closely resembles Mrs. Morrison's.
    Jeannie Robertson comes of tinkler-gypsy stock, and her people
are well known on Speyside.  It seems likely that the song will have
