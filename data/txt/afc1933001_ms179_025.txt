Chicago, Illinois

Dear Jack:

I have rather less to do with the OFF than you
do, I'm afraid.  It's completely separate from
the Library and we only feel occasionally a
gentle stirring at the foot of the mountain
which we presume originates up in that Olympus of
big-time publishers and radio production men.

I hope you'll have luck in getting a job there
but my opinion is that you won't.  Sorry.

Regards to you both.

Sincerely,

Alan
