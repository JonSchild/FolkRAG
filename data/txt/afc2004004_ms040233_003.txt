But Kingsburgh was obliged to take him to task. Poor
Betty promised to behave herself better. Accordingly
at the next brook, the unfortunate gown was draggling
through the water! They could not help laughing ; and I
heard the old gentleman say, "They do call your
Highness a Pretender : If you are one, all I can say 
is, that you are the worst of your trade that ever
was seen."
172. ...Mrs McDonald was now ready, & went towards
the hall, but her nerves were also upset by the
unfortunate object of our [anxiety?] : so she called to to her
husband to bring the keys, then he opened the door 
and brought his wife into the room. The Prince, who 
had taken a seat, rose up, & saluted her according
to our [Highland?] fashion, as being the lady of the house.
Oh! how frightened she was! She told we afterwards, 
for under Betty's hood she experienced the roughness of 
a man's chin!
175. ...Well, there we were, a cosy party of 4, & my
heart was joyed to see how much our Royal Charlie
was pleased with his company, & what justice he did to
our plentiful yet frugal meal. He called for a
[?] of stiff brandy-and-water, to the health &
prosperity of Kingsburgh & his lady, & I came in for
my share of the toast also.
