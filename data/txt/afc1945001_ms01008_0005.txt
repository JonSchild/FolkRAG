What was the situation? At that time--the very end of October, which happened by sheer coincidence to be the week before the election--at that time the country was crawling with rumors, which apparently some citizens believed. There was a story that came in to Washington from various parts of the country, in slightly different forms--a story that the whole Pacific fleet had been sunk, but that the administration was going to hold up the news till after election. There was another story, reported from upstate New York near the end of October, that the Solomon Islands had actually been lost about the middle of that month. Every day the navy was issuing, and the newspapers were publishing, communiques reporting continued action in the Solomons; but presumably people who swallowed that particular yarn thought that the navy was writing fiction.  On the night of October 26th a United States Senator, whom his constituents might reasonably have supposed to be well informed, said (if press dispatches quoted him correctly) that our navy was almost out of commission in the Pacific.  It happened that that very day, our navy had inflicted a defeat on an enemy fleet off the Santa Cruz Islands--doing them heavy damage and forcing them to retreat to their bases, from which they did not emerge to resume the attack for more than two weeks.     Not so bad, for a navy that was almost out of commission; though it was not very kind to the Senator for the navy to come up with so prompt a refutation of his story.

Well, these rumors--these phonies--were being spread around the country at the end of October; and certain people in Washington had to spend most of their time answering citizens who wanted to know if it was really true  that we had suffered all these terrible disasters, but that the administration was holding up the news till after election.  Now, it does no good to a nation at war if its people become convinced--for whatever reason, at whosever prompting--that their government is suppressing bad news because it is afraid of the public reaction.  So when, on October 31st, the news came in that the damaged carrier had been sunk, the President gave orders that this be announced immediately; and it was.  But our naval commanders in the Pacific doubt if the enemy, though he knew he had seriously damaged the ship, would have known that se was lost if we had not told him.  In this case, as the President said the other night, we may have given valuable military information to the enemy, in order to persuade the American people that we were not holding back worse news.  That is the sort of problem the Japanese government doesn't have to worry about; it can tell its people anything it likes and get away with it. 

In the war of 1904 against Russia, the Japanese started out with six battleships.  Two of those battleships were sunk in a single day by mines--a heavy loss; it would have been a great advantage to the Russians to have known it.  But no Russians were near when they sank; and neither the Russians, nor the Japanese people, nor anybody else, was permitted to know that those two battleships had been lost till the war was over.  Concealment of this news was certainly in the interest of military security, but such concealment would be impossible in a democracy.  Perhaps indeed it would undesirable in a democracy.  But in a country where the people rule, the people must make up their minds whether they want to damage their own collective interest by telling the enemy what he doesn't know; or whether they are willing to trust their government to tell them as much as it can, as soon as it can, with safety.

We do not want to give any military information to the enemy; we do want to tell the American people as much as we can, without endangering our own forces, or helping the enemy.  Remember that, the next time rumors start going round--even if is happens to be just before an election. 

Most of the American people seem,as one radio commentator puts it, to want their news to be brutally frank, no matter how bad it may be.  That is a healthy feeling; but I hope this appetite for frankness works both ways.  Some people, in their zeal for brutal frankness, almost seem to feel that the government ought to put out bad news, whether it has any or not.
