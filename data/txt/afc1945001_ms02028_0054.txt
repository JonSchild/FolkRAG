Ordnance Plant

Woman worker, union, 8-10-42: "This union official told me, on the q.t. of course, that the ordnance plant is turning out stuff so fast they have to lay off every once in a while because they don't have any place to send it - the warehouses are so full in the east because of the shipping situation. They give as their excuse priorities, but that is just not true."
Catholic priest, 8-14-42: "The language women use at the ordnance plant is terribly vulgar."
Catholic priest, 8-14-42: "There is a very definite appearance already of a serious moral effect, particularly in sexual relationships among people at the ordnance plant." 
Business man, 8-14-42: "You continue to hear constant stories about moral conditions out at the ordnance plant, which everyone seems to feel are very bad." 
Employment official, 8-15-42: "There is a general story about the ordnance plant that they can't get into operation because of the brass shortage."
