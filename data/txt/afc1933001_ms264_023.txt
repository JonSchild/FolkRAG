Stones in My Passway, Johnson,
Robt. Johnson, Perfect 7-12-67, (Dal 377)

I got stones in my passway and my road seems dark at night, (2)
I have pains in my heart, they have taken my appetite.

I have a bird to whistle and i have a bird to sing, (2)
I got a woman that I'm loving, boy, but she don't mean a thing.

My enemies have betrayed me, have overtaken poor Bob at last, (2)
And they's one thing, certainly, they have stones all in my pass.

Now you tryin' to take my life
And allmy lovin', too,
You laid the passways fuh me,
Now what are you trying to do,
I'm cryin', "Hoo---,
Hoo--let us be friends,
And when you hear me howlin' in my passways, [mama] rider, please open yo' do'
an' let me in.

I got three legs to truck on, oh, please don't block my road, (2)
I [feelin' the same about my] rider, babe, I'm booked an' I've
got to go.

I've been feelin' saved by
I've been betrayed by my rider
