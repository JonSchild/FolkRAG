Reel 36 (contd.) Macpherson 

Release my hands from out my bonds 
And gie tae me my sword 
And there's nae a man in a' Scotland 
But I'll daur him at his word." 
For some cam' here tae see me hang 
And some to buy my fiddle 
But before that I will part we' her 
I would break her through the middle. 
Sae rantingly, sae wantonly, etc. 

It's an awfu' pity. You could easy get the words.
