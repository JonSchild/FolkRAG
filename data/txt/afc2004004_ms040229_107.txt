Notes from [Cov?] [?aedelica]

p. xxi -- Poor clo [tr?]
Forth goes the many a [t?] [wi?e]
or the [macha] of [?] [uist?] ...

--The crowding onto poor land
The big bearts to eat the little beasts, The
little beasts doing the best they may.

Quote  for [?acfur] - "[Grod mar] , old things
are passed away, allthings are become new."
Ministers against fiddlers - "Better is
the small fire that warms on the little day
of peace, Than the big fire that burns
on the great day of wrath."

(I have copied the [A?] Book
extracts.)
I must go now as I'm due in 
the office at 7 pm. for this
"clam blast"  I'm frozen +
famishing!!  I've handed
your coat to the man at the door
can't wait any longer.
