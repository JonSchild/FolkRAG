Chain Gang Negroes

"Ninety-nine years on de hard, hard ground,
'Member de night you blowed de woman down?
De Jedge he found me guilty, de clerk he wrote it down;
Next cold winter mornin' I was penitentiary bound.
Here I am for de rest of my nachul life,
And all I ever done was to kill my wife."

One night recently in the auditorium of the Press Club
Building of washington I played some phonograph records of
Negro work songs I had made for the Library of Congress from
the singing of Negro convicts in the South.

"They were so pathetic," said a lady to me afterwards;
"so like the singing I have just heard in Florida - Negro
chain gangs, you know?"

"Just what do you mean by a 'chain gang'?" For I had
not understood the term when I started out to visit Southern 
penitentiaries.

"Oh, all these Negro men were tied together by a chain
running from one leg to another and, just think, at each end 
of a line of these working men a guard sat on his horse with
a shot gun in his hands!" she went on in tones of horror.

As it happened, I had recently come from a week's stay
at the Florida penitentiary. Afterwards, I had travelled the
entire length of the State visiting the gangs of Negro convicts
at work on the public roads. I had talked with the guards,
with the various assistant wardens and with the superintendent.
