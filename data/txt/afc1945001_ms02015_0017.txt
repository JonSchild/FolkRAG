en masse, however, key people in their organization should be approached to help 
select those qualified to be enrolled.  It is far better to start small and grow 
slowly, than to start with a large group and be unable to use them properly (as well 
as [being] having a lot of dead wood to keep track of).
            D.    An analytical staff should be put under the direct supervision of some 
research specialist, preferably a psychologist or sociologist who should recruit the 
staff needed as the needs become apparent. 
            E.    Programs of counteraction should be planned by a central committee 
following each completed analysis and the appropriate steps should be taken. 
            F.    The chairman of the central committee should communicate with the OWI
as soon as possible, and the supervisor of rumor analysis should establish contact 
with the Bureau of Intelligence, OWI, as soon as he is appointed. 
            G.    In summary: 
                    Rumor committee should
                        1-   impress community with its responsibility
                        2-   have represented on it key people (including all minority 
                               groups that exist in the community in any large numbers) 
            It should function through 
                        1-   volunteer (but carefully selected) rumor spotters
                        2-   careful rumor analysis
                        3-   major educational campaign
