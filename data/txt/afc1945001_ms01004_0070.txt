CANADA
OFFICE OF
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC INFORMATION

OTTAWA, CANADA
July 4, 1942.

Eugene Katz, Esq.,
Chief of Correspondence Division,
Office of Facts and Figures,
Library of Congress Annex,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Katz:

The Canadian Government has recently set up a Committee
on Morale, to undertake research in connection with certain serious
problems of morale that exist in Canada.

At the present time we are interested in three principal
problems:
(a) Rumors and loose talk.
(b) Industrial unrest.
(c) Race tension (French-speaking versus
English-speaking.)

The Committee feels that it would be advisable for one or
two of us to visit Washington in the near future to find out what type
of organizations the American Government has set up to deal with the
problem of maintaining national morale. It is very likely that another
member of the Committee and myself (both of us are trained psychologists)
will visit Washington at the end of July or early in August.

Mr. Hadley Cantril, who visited Ottawa last weekâ€“end, advised
me to write you for information regarding your branch. When we visit
Washington, we should very much like to have an opportunity of discussing
with you the work you are doing. I should appreciate any information that
you may be able to give me in advance of our visit to Washington, and should
welcome the opportunity of meeting you when we arrive. In two or three
weeks time, I shall be able to let you know what days we plan to be in
Washington, and perhaps it might be possible for us to make an appointment
before we set out.

Yours sincerely,
J. A. Irving
J. A. Irving,
Research Secretary,
Committee on Morale.
