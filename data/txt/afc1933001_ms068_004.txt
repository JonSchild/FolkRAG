Dear Mr. Lomax:-

     If the "Snow Bird" with words by F. C. Woodward
is not of record with the music it is possible for me
to supply it. The music is now in preparation from
my recollection of the song as sung in the 'sixties.

     It is a childrens song, but to my knowledge
it was not generally known in my childhood. 

     Very truly,
          George S. Hoke
          George Storer Hoke
