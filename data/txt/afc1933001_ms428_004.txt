Loch Lomond

1. By yon bonnie banks and
By yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright
on Loch Lomon',
Where my and my true love
Were even wont to be,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks
of Loch Lomon'

Oh, ye'll tak' the high road and
I'll tak' the low road, 
And I'll be in Scotland before ye;
But me and my true love will never
meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of 
Loch Lomon'.

2. 'Twas there that we parted
In yon shady glen
On the steep, steep side of
Ben Lomon'
Where purple in hue,
The Highland hills we view,
And the moon coming out
In the gloaming.
Refrain

Believe Me, If all Those Endearing
Young Charms

1. Believe me, if all those endearing 
young charms,
Which I gaze on so fondly today,
Were to change by tomorrow,
And fleet in my arms,
Like fairy gifts, fading away,
Thou wouldst still be adored as this 
moment thou art,
Let thy loveliness fade as it will;
And around the dear ruin, each wish
of my heart
Would entwine itself verdantly still!

2. It is not while beauty and youth are
thine own,
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear,
That the fervor and faith of a soul
can be known,
To which time will but make thee
more dear!
No, the heart that has truly loved
never forgets,
But as truly loves on to the close;
As the sunflower turns on her god,
When he sets, the same look which
She turned when he rose!

Gentle Annie
1. Thou wilt come no more, gentle Annie,
Like a flow'r thy spirit did depart;
Thou art gone, alas! like the many
That have bloomed in the summer of
my heart.

Chorus
Shall we never more behold thee?
Shall we never more,
Never hear thy winning voice again,
When the springtime comes, gentle
Annie,
When the wild flowr's are scattered 
o'er the plain?

2. We have roamed and loved 'mid the 
bowers
When they downy cheeks were in their 
bloom 
Now I stand alone 'mid the flowers,
While they mingle their perfume
o'er thy tomb.

3. Ah! the hours grow sad while I ponder
Near the silent spot where thou are laid
And my heart bows down while I wander
By the streams and the meadows where
we strayed.

All Through the Night
1. Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee
All through the night;
Guardian angels God will send thee, 
All through the night,
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,
Hill and vale in slumber steeping,
I my loving vigil keeping
All through the night.

2. While the moon her watch is keeping
All through the night;
While the weary world is sleeping
All through the night.
O'er thy spirit gently stealing,
Visions of delight revealing,
Breathes a pure and holy feeling,
All through the night.
