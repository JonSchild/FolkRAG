If there are many rumors in a community about Lend-Lease, for example,
the most effective way of handling such rumors might be to 
launch an information campaign on Lend-Lease--lectures, feature 
stories, editorials, discussion groups, Sunday articles, etc.

Sometimes an information gap cannot be filled temporarily,
because of military security. When a warship is in an American
harbor, for example, that fact cannot be published without aiding 
the enemy, even though the warship and its sailors are visible to 
many people in the port areas. Extravagant rumors about this ship,
or the crew, or the cargo may arise from such a situation. But 
these rumors would not spread unless people repeated what they saw
or what they heard. The Office of War Information is in possession
of ample evidence that the enemy, or his agents, often does not
know what hundreds of Americans do know about a given war port or
war plant: the repetition of facts or rumors, in such circumstances,
often makes it easier for the enemy to find out what he did not 
know, or simply suspected.

Types of Rumors

The 4,500 rumors analyzed by the Office of War Information
fall into five general classes:

a. By far the greater number may be called "hate 
rumors"; they express prejudice, animosity, or hostility
for groups other then the enemy.

b. The second group may be classified as "anxiety
rumors"; they reflect uneasiness or fear and commonly
take the form of unfounded reports of United Nations
