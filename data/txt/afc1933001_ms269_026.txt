We, besides, need funds with which to aid part-time collecting prospects of collectors outside our Archive staff. We need funds for the duplication of Archive collections, so that we can make it available to the Defense Program and to musicians, educators and etc. who want this material. We need funds for duplication of already existing collections outside the Library.

As this material is brought in, it will require additional staff as follows:

1. Two cataloguers, 2. One stack boy, 3. One field director.

Ofcourse, a great many of these staff problems might be solved if adequate W.P. A. help was provided on a reasonable and permanent basis.
