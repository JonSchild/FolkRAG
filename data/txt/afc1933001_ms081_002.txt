Dear John Avery: 

Mental telepathy is great thing and I 
was just reading a letter which I had written to my
son when you telephoned this morning. 

I am enclosing my check for $5.00 to cover
cost of book and expressage of the book by you and
Alan about Lead Belly which I know that Sonny will
greatly enjoy, particularly when autographed by you
and Alan. Sonny's address is as follows: 

Geo. A. Hill, III
Children's Hospital School
Baltimore, Maryland

I wrote him this morning about the new publication 
by MacMillan and also about the cowboy song
that you thought would particularly appeal to him, -
"My Doney Gal".

I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed our
visit yesterday which enabled me, for the time, to recapture 
many early and pleasant memories and to express
anew my high esteem and friendship for you. 

Sincerely yours,

Geo. A. Hill. Jr.
