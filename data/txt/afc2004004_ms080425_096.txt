Time Code:  Tape: #227 Sacred Harp p.5
All sing: "...come with me along my journey..."
Mr. R.: That was good! And always remember that the tenor part 
carries the melody of the song. The other parts, the 
treble, alto and bass just carry the harmony. For 
beginners who are just learning how to sing, i suggest 
you learn to sing on tenor first. OK, Philip, you and 
your friend Sean come on. This young fellow can't 
hardly wait.....
