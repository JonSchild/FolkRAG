Fisk, 7. 2. HAFFER.

H: I compsed that song last May.

A: And how did it go?

If you will stop and listen,
I'll sing to you a song
about the appaling disastor,
Ab ut the war going on.
I'll tell you how it started
And when it all began.
I'll tell you about this suffereing
But when we can't tell when it'll end.

Not only xxx I and you,
Got the rich and the poor,
Every nationality
Don't know what to do.

These days everybody got trouble,
Not o nly I and you,
The rich and the poor,
Every nationality
Don't know what to do.

It was in the month of September,
Nineteen hundred thity-nine,
War broke out in Europe,
Made everybody troubled in mind.

Germany invaded Poland,
Whipped them in eighte[n]en days,
Throwed their leaders into exile,
And reduced the people to slaves.

These days got everybody troubled, etc[c].

(Fought together side by side)
Now England and France allied,
Came to Poland's relief,
Fought together side by side
Til France was fianlly beat.

Now after they'dsigned the armistice,
And France's soldiers went home,
England was left with the bag to hold,
And left to [g]fight alon[g]e.

These days, etc.

These days, etc.

Germany and Italy, together with Jay-pan
Made and signed the Three Power Pact
In an effort to rule the land.
Denmark, Norway, Holland,
Belgium and Jugoslavia, too
Were all invaded by Hitler,
And placed under German rule.
