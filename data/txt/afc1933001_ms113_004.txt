Dear Mr. Botkin:

On checking through our Albums I find that we have 
two copies of record number 8 and no copy of record number
7 in Album 2. I will be delighted to swap with you and am sending
off our extra number 8 under separate cover.

The leaflets for the Albums were received with delight,
so much so, in fact, that we would like to ask for another set
if you can spare one. They are really valuable to our script-
writers as well as to the music department; and if you could
send us another set, we would all be grateful. 

I will certainly let you know if we record any more 
material like the W.C. Handy show, and I hope you will remember
us when you get new material into the Library which we might
be able to use. we are particularly interested in foreign language
music of almost all kinds.

Please give my regards to my friends in the Library. 

Yours sincerely

Bess Lomax
