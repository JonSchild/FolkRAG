To duplicate part of the immense Barbeau Canadian
collection in Canada; to duplicate the Barry collection in
Harvard (mostly New England songs); to duplicate the Herskovits
collection of songs from Africa, Trinidad and Dutch Guiana and
Haiti, which will give us a pretty complete picture of the
development of West African music in the Western Hemisphere,
the whole background of our Negro songs.  Your personal Negro
collection will top the heap.  To duplicate the Virginia ballad
collection, the Chapel's West Virginia ballad collection,
Kirkland's East Tennessee collection and such others as there
remains funds for.

Recording trips to the Tennessee Valley for the documentation
of a Tennessee Valley community; two Mississippi Delta
communities, a study to be made in collaboration with Fisk
University of the singing habits of the Negro as related to
community living.  To finance Vance Randolph to record his
large and wide-spread ballad collection in the Ozark region;
to send records and other help to John Faulk for his project;
to record the songs in the migratory camps in the Rio Grande
Valley; and to help Brownie McNeal record his large collection
of Mexican Corridos; to help the Wisconsin Music Department
continue its study of folk songs in all the languages in the 
United States; to help Eloise Winscott in her New England
recording trip.  To send a recording trip to South America
for six months or a year with an additional $3500 voted by
Congress to the State Department for Latin-American
co-operation.

In this regard, Congress has also appropriated $6000
for sending records for radio programs from the Library of
Congress to Latin-America.  $3000 of this will be spent in
making up a set of 25 pressings of the best Archive records
for Latin-American distribution in sets, two or three to
each country.  We shall also make up a series of programs on
American folksongs for radio transcriptions, with a commentary
in Spanish and Portuguese.

We intend, besides, to press within the year about 50
additional records for general distribution for those who
write in for folk song recordings.  These will be available
in albums and singly for about 50 cents or $1.00 apiece.
