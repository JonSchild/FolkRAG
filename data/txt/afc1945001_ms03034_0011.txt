To Morale Wardens: 

Propaganda, rumor, and public opinion are vital problems of the home 
front in time of war.  In order to take some positive action against enemy propaganda 
and rumor, the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety has instituted a 
Division of Propaganda Research.  This was deemed necessary because roughly fifty 
per cent of the rumors which were collected during the first few months of the war 
followed directly the Axis short wave broadcasts. 

You have been recommended by your Union as a person qualified to aid in
this work, and are hereby appointed Morale Warden. The idea of morale wardens was 
set forth and approved by a recent meeting of both C.I.O. and A.F. of L. leaders, 
called by the Division of Propaganda Research. The morale warden was conceived as 
a person of sound judgment and high intelligence who could undertake the duties outlined below. The morale warden is not a spy nor a police officer. His job is to 
report facts relating to public opinion, rumor and propaganda. 

The duties of a morale warden are four fold:  (1) to report all manner of 
rumors to this office.  (2) to fill out questionnaires on your impression of public 
opinion on various issues connected with the war.  (3) to aid in the distribution of pamphlets, posters, and bulletins which this office will send you.  (4) to act on 
your own initiative to check the spread of Axis inspired rumors. 

You will be asked to make a report to this office every two weeks. 
Stamped envelopes and regular forms will be sent you for this purpose. 

If you are willing to accept this appointment as Morale Warden, kindly 
fill out the enclosed questionnaire and return it to this office. On the accompanying 
sheet please note any rumors which you have heard of late, rumors about racial 
minorities, sabotage, the British, etc. 

Providing you are willing to undertake this work, we will send you every 
two weeks, in addition to the regular forms for your report, a bulletin setting 
forth timely facts about rumor, enemy propaganda and trends in public opinion. It 
is hoped that this bulletin may be either read to your union meeting or posted in 
your union headquarters. In addition we will send you posters and pamphlets issued 
by this office as they are published. 

We hope very much that you will be able to aid us in this work. You 
should find it much more interesting than the average sort of voluntary defense 
work, and your services can be a most valuable contribution to our effort to control 
enemy propaganda. 

Yours very truly, 

R. H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research

George C. Wiswell, Director 
Public Information Division
