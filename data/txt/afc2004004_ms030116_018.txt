     I don't think it's right for this state to be so tight against the 
citizen people -- people that don't have a cote record. Fur their pro-
tection. You walk in the woods barefoot, you gon carry a stick to hit 
the rattlesnake. 
     Ain't nobody gon rare up against no hardware. (a gun) We have the 
po'rest pertection ever wuz, I'm tellin you straight. 
     In N.C. every man or woman bettah be off the street after twevle 
o'clock. If you can't give no perminint reason why you're out, somebody 
bettah send for you in the mawnin. 
     Some folks brought up in decent respectable homes is been out of 
work so long they done got case hard. They'll stick you up, take all you 
got. Throw a gun on you, tell you to shove them yo cash register. 

     What is ten dollars? What is twenty dollars? What is three hundred 
dollars today? You can spend that fore you can pop yo fingers. Some 
peoples stick you up for a package of cigarettes -- don't make no sense. 
I don't want my brains knocked out by them kina people. 
     Ever time somebody walk up close to you, you think they're gonna 
kill you. You walk out wid killin on yo mind. That ain't no way to 
live. You kill somebody an the lectric chair is comin up. 
     The jedge don't take no consideration. 
     We're not put heah to be killed like dogs or snakes. We're human 
beings. Yet somebody rushes you, an you've killed them befo you know it. 
You didn't wanna do it.
