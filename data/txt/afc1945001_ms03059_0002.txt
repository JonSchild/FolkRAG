Gentlemen:
I am attaching a report as suggested in the directive. During this period, August 3 to 8, there appeared to be very little conversation relative to the war effort. This is apparently accounted for by the deep concern over the situation in Russia. The main topics of conversation were the battles in the Russian Caucasus and the possible effects to the allies of a major defeat of the Russian armies.
Very truly yours,
D. L. LaBreche
