my machine, visiting especially 
en route, Mississippi, Florida, 
South Carolina, Virginia with 
stops in Tennessee and Kentucky
It will take me some time
to get there, but I'll be along 
sometimes. Alan is in the University 
here and will not travel with 
me.
Some time ago Professor Herzog 
write me that he was shipping 
to the Library the cylinders on 
which I secured in 1907-1910
many western songs. Little of 
this music has ever been written 
out. When I get there I hope 
we well be able to work out 
some way of transcribing it .
You can write me here
and your letter will be forwarded,
Sincerely yours, John A. Lomax
