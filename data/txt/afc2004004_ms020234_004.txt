[*"ROUGH BOYS"*]
BJ:     The way he was dressed, I reckon.  An’ the way he looked.
He wasn’t         . Wh-when you play with them rough boys --
I call ‘em rough boys...You play with them...
TL:     The thing that makes them look rough is the way that they
dress?
BJ:     Yeah, their appearance.  [Every, every]Any, anybody, you know,
anybody, that, that’s a strike.   You know, I 
mean, you know that.  So .    'Cause ah, that’s just the way 

An’ The way they talk, “Aah...aah.”  Heh, heh!  They wanna act
more man than what they are, you know, some of ‘em.  So that is...
I never could hardly stomach those boys no how...None at all, I’m
tellin’ ya!

[*ELDEST GRANDCHILD*]
TL:      Bessie, let's get back to the grandchildren thing.   I don't
know how much of it went on, so I'll start over again.  You said
you got your first grandchild before you got your son?
BJ:      Um-hum...Um-hum.
TL:      And which one was more important to you?
BJ:      I, I say my grandson still feels like he, he's the big
man of the house.   Because he's the first one, first boy in the 
family...He is the tallest, too...Yeah, he's about, almost 7 feet.
Yessir.  He's almost 7 feet.
          An' they all have been children to me, ever since they've
been in the world.  Ain't none of 'em did me no harm, ya know?
[Yeah] No, no kind of sass or no kind of nothin'.   Just good, that's
all.
TL:      And that's important.
