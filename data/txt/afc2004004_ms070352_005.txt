[L.C. Fisk Field Trip]

Music
Reference Department /////
August 5, 1942

Mr. Alan Lomax who is engaged in field work on the musical survey
of Coahoma County, Mississippi, undertaken last year cooperatively
with Fisk University, has requested that funds be provided to enable
him to extend his present trip for two weeks.  The purposes of such
extension would be:
1. To continue for one week longer his present work.  The Fisk
University field workers have been in the area for several months, and 
according to Mr. Lomax, "much material has been located which I have
as yet been unable to record, and much of this material is crucial to
the completion of this study...We have mapped out the main outlines
of music in this county and will be able to use our material for recommendations 
for any type of morale work in the middle South."

2. To record the Sacred Harp or "white spiritual" music of the 
southern mountains in collaboration with Dr. George Pullen Jackson
of Vanderbilt University.  This is a type of music for which the 
Archive receives constant requests, and Dr. Jackson is the leading
collector [collaborator] and authority in the field.  The localities visited will
be approximately along Mr. Lomax's return route to Washington.

The proposed budget is as follows:

Per diem, August 8 to 22, 14 days at $5.00                  $70.00
1000 miles travel at 5 cents a mile                                 50.00

100[0] 16-inch records                                                  150.00
[75 duplicates, 50 for Fisk University and]
25 for Dr. Jackson                                            [375.00] 125.00 
4 sapphire needles                                                          20.00
Incidentals                                                                       75.00
                                                                        [740.00]  490.00 

Overhead of Recording Laboratory                 [148.00]   98.00 
 TOTAL                                                            [$888.00] 588.00 

I recommend that this expenditure be approved.  The fact that
Mr. Lomax is already in the field and has not been able to exhaust
the possibilities for productive work, represents an opportunity which 
I feel should not be overlooked.  [Both of the groups of records
described will contribute materially to the ability of the Music
Division to meet the demands of morale agencies for advice and 
assistance.]

Respectfully yours,

Harold Spivacke, Chief
Division of Music
