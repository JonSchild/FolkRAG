BALLAD HUNTER FOR ALAN LOMAX TO IDENTIFY:

1. 2nd. item on Side II, "Blues and Hollers".
identified in script[s] as "Gar Mouth" record.
We cannot identify "Gar Mouth" or the name of the song.
If it is in the Archive we can get the other data as
long as we have the title and singer.

2. 1st. and last items on Side III, "Chisholm Trail".
The songs are "Trail to Mexico" and "Whopee Ti Yi Yo,
Git Along Little Dogies". We think the singer is Woodie
Guthrie in both instances, but would like to affirm this.
Apparently they are not in the Archive-does Lomax happen
to know any recording data-date, place, collector, etc.?
