 Doodles, rabbit run.       R-81 cont.

â€¦...Well, in the spring of the year I sow soybeans and peas in
strips here.  And this strip here was peas here in the spring,
and they took all the peas out, that volunteer college up there,
you know.  ^^^....Already we got most of the peas and most of
the soybeans up.  We recently sowed this patch of, this strip
of oats and I got another strip on the other side.  And of course
in afew das, I be sowing rye grass and clover corn.....for
the rabbits.  They love soybeans and peas in the summertime, and
in the wintertime, I sow wheat and oats and clover and I just
got these two strips sowed in wheat and I plant in the next few
days some clover and rye grass- they like that too and I found
out here that you don't have any problem about having rabbits
if you have the right food for them and the right kind of habitat.
So that's why we got all these weeds and things, and all these
brush piles where they can get in and get away from the predators
that chase rabbits and last year I had a real good crop of rabbits,
I guess 50 got out of the pen.  The wire rusted around the 
bottom, I guess I lost 50 last year, but I got that fixed, got
em stopped, so I guess we got a good crop this year and look like
we got plenty of rabbits.
AL:  And you just keep this place for running rabbits in.
Man:  Yeah, that's all I got it for, hardly ever run the
pack in here because actually, if they run him too hard, they
fun him against the fence and kill him.  We don't want no rabbits
killed if we can help it.  We like to take care of them and we got
several predators here that gets our rabbits -- cats has been pretty
