30) Bring back his sword," said Jock o' North,
"And freely to him gie;
Or I swear a braid Scotch oath
I'll gar five million die."

31) "And where's the lady?" said John O' North,
"It's fain I would her see."
"She's locked up in her ain chamber
The king, he keeps the key."

32) So they hae gaen afore the king,
With courage bold and free.
Their armour bright gace sich a light
It almost blinded his eye.

33) "Where is the lady?" said John O' North,
"It's fain I would her see.
For I hae sworn a solemn oath
She's gaeing to Bennachie."

34) "O take the lady," the king he says,
"You're wecome ot her for me.
For I never thought ye had sich men
From the fort o' Bennachie."

35) "If I had kenned," said John O'North,
"You werena sae muckle as me.
I would have brought you bigger men,
Whose size is three by three."

36) But wae betide the little boy
That tidings brought to me,
Let all England say what they will,
It's hanged he shall be.

37) "O take the lady," the king he said,
"You're welcome to her frae me.
O take the lady," the king he said,
And the boy he shall go free."

38) "A priest, a priest," young Johnny cried,
"To join my love and me."
"A clerk, a clerk," the king he cried,
"To seal her tocher wi'."

39) But out it spoke young Johnny then,
These words pronounced he;
"O he has lands and rents and neuk
He'll seek nae gold from thee."
