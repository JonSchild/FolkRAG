Mr. John A. Lomax,
    Library of Congress,
    Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
    
    We, at the University of Denver, are planning for a regional folklore
conference during the week of July 21-25. As principal speaker and counsaler,
we hope to secure a national authority to be with us for at least two days
during this period. If it would be possible for you to come, we would be
greatly delighted.

    We know, of course, that there are many demands upon your time, but
it may be that your plans include a summer in the West so that attendance
at our conference would not require a great deal of travel. We would be
glad to entertain you while you are in Denver and to give you an honorarium
of one hundred dollars. We would expect you to give brief talks and to take
part in the discussions.

    If it will be impossible for you to come, will you be good enough to
suggest others who we might secure for this type of leadership.

    Sincerely yours,
    L. J. Davidson
    L. J. Davidson
    Chairman, Department of English
    Literature.
