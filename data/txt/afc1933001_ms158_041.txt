The plan submitted by Peter Seeger is a survey of
folk instrumental techniques which is very interesting but
impractical of accomplishment in connection with the
Carnegie grant recently received. This grant does not
provide for the purchase of any moving picture equipment
which, I might add, would be considerably more expensive
than estimated by Mr. Seeger.
Mr. Seeger's second suggestion for "spot broadcasts"
has been under consideration in the Archive for some time.
In fact, Mr. Lomax already experimented with one such broadcast
last year on his American School of the Air program.
