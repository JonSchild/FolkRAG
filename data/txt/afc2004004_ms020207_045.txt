Reverend Roe.  Reel 10.  P. 2
[as] there is a Hell and a Heaven.
[*Hell should be preached*]
A: Do you believe in scaring the sinner and making him --
R:  Well, I believe this: that the fear of punishment and the hope of
reward have more effect on human conduct than anything else, and when
you offer him the reward [from] through Christ and show him the punishement
unless he accepts Christ, why, I think that constrains him.
A: Do you look on the Devil as a real person that walks the world?
R: I do, [I swear it] a spirit. I look on the Devil as a person and I believe
he gets in people just like the Holy Spirit, the weaker spirits
get in people just like they did when Christ was here, and they must
be casted out before [he] we can ever be a good m[a]en or good wom[a]en.
A: Do you believe in, that people have actually seen the Devil with
their own two eyes?
[*Devil*]
R: Well, I don't think that he['s] is a visible - [in] he's spirit, [still] the devil the spirit.
There's no man, I don't believe, has ever just seen the Devil with their own
two eye, [nor] they never have they seen God. But God have been a  [view] revealed to us
through Jesus Christ, and the Devil have never been because he'd have
scared us all to death in the world if he ever hada been.
A: I guess you've realy seen people that were possessed of the Devil
and you couldn't reach them in revivals.
R: Oh, yes. Make em mad, they'd get mad, you talk to the about religion. 
[You] It's just a Devil gets in you when the Devil possesses you,
why, you just as bad as you can be. Yeah, It's nothing but the Devil
that makes men do evil, and men can get possessed with devils and
become robbers, just become anything that's bad. And the only way
that that man will ever be converted, the Devil have to be casted out
of him.
A:  Well, Reverend, the way that your poeple have to live right here in Dallas, right
here in this town now you know were talking about how things were in
Louisiana, how about the way they have to live right here in Dallas?
