TAPE 51: SEAN MCDONAUGH. Carna. County Galway.
Noreen, My Love:
Sally Ogh: Seamus Ennis says: Sally, yo ung red-haired Sally is
probably one of the most moving of our love songs. Young people
tell me that a man was charged in court with the murder of his
wife, Sally. When charged, he composed this song in the witness
box and sang it to the judge, and was released.
"Am I not a pity, going to Karraghenn
And crying and keening and making sorrow,
Carrying my baby on my fore-arm
And not even having a drop of milk to give to him?
I am very weak - there is no point in denying it.
I am not even as good as the mist. . ."

The Roving Galway Boy.   Music
1) From Galway Bay we sailed away it was in the month of May,
My true love she stood a-weeping, while standing on the quay.
My true love she stood weeping and bitterly did cry
"O he's gone and God be with him, my roving Galway boy."

2) From Galway Bay we sailed away, the weather it being fair.
And when we reached the coast of Clare we fell in deep despair,
The anchor it was lifted and the weatherhold mounted high,
Then I thought of lovely Erin and my roving Glaway boy.

3) At a Galway Street the tears came down, our ship is going to sail.
We bound for Philadelphia with a true and pleasant gale,
But when we landed on the shore, no friends there could I spy,
Then I thought of lovely Erin and my roving galway boy.

4) Twas scarce six months had passed and gone, a letter he sent me home,
Enquiring for his absent friends and the love he left at home,
He sent her home her passage, which accounts for all her joy,
She is now in Philadelphia with her roving Galway boy.

5) So now he's settled down at work, 5 pound a week he's paid,
So cheer up. lovely Mary, and now dont' get afraid,
For while there's life, there's always hope our fortune for to try
And there's gold in store for Mary and her roving Galway Boy.
