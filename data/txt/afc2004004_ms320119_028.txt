ow, came here, I guess and from New York I think, and they, they like that French 
music.  They, they miss not one dance when they was playing the French music.  
[They like the.] rhythm.  They like the, the tune, you know.
LOMAX  But when you were a kid you were supposed to be ashamed of that,
weren't you?
:  Oh well I never was ashamed of the French language, never.  I think
it's an honor to be able to, you know I was a, in the [BACGROUND TALKING]. . .
during the Second World War, and a lot of people through Casablanca came there w[?????????], 
you know. And I, well I carry a conversation with him, you know,
and he says yeah, you understand those French people?  I said yeah, sure I do.
:  Did you study that in school?
:  No, I say I didn't.  But you see there was a French girl who married
a Cajun and who, she came and lived close neighbor to us.  And she was always 
at home.  I learned her language, you know.  She was at home every week, you 
know.  So I enjoyed having her, to learn her language, you know.
What, they told me something, you know, they said exactly what they meant, 
they don't use the same expression but the same word as we do.
LOMAX  Cajun is a language of its own, isn't it?
:  Well I think so.  It's a melange of several languages.  You find
a lot of Spanish.  I've even traced some Latin words going back to the Latin of
Julius Caesar and some of the old verbs still are predominant today among the. . .
but you won't find in modern French.  It, it's really a combination.  We got a 
little bit of African in our Cajun that we got from the negro.  What else?  Then 
we got a little bit from the, well naturally from the English.  And all that put 
together gives a very interesting language.  The accent itself varies from one 
place to another but it's not all that important.  Like in the [UNCLEAR].  And 
when I was a Merchant Seaman we went over there.  And all them people, they're all 
tall, tall, tall, and they're Mohamed and Muslim, Hebrews and everything.  There 
were some [UNCLEAR].  And they pulled that cart with a little, a little horse.  
And with those seamen, Merchant Seaman, going back to the ship, and that little 
two-wheel cart, in the back there was a rubber sheet you call that.  And [UNCLEAR] 
there was a big sackful of rum.  And going back to the ship about 2 o'clock 
in the morning, so we do like this, you know, and that two-wheel cart, they got 
a strap like this so the, it don't go backwards.  But it start going like this, 
you know, then the horse, the two front, two front that wouldn't touch.  They 
had Muhamed and he got on top of them two [UNCLEAR], you know them two things met
in [UNCLEAR], to put some weight in the front so if the little horse [UNCLEAR]

LOMAX  Listen, I think we had a terrific show.  Let's look at some of
it now, no?  Let's, can we, can we look at a little bit of it?  Just cut it and
look.  [MIKE OFF]

And we are now beginning tape number 1387 with Michel Doucet.

LOMAX  The big and important continuities in music, as in all the arts,
go person-to-person.  You can't write music down, all of it.  You just write a
little scheme.  The rest of it has to be learned from a master, how to play it,
how to put it together.  That applies to classical music and it also applies to
folk music.  And if we're going to keep our folk music we have to have people who 
want to devote themselves to sitting at the feet of the masters of their particular 
kind of song, the one that they want to continue and keep on, learn it long 
and painfully, learn it with joy, learn it with the belief that this music and 
how it's played, exactly how it's played, is the real way to play music, their
