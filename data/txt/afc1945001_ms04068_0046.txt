"A couple of school teachers who are working for the summer at Hill 
Field told me that the place is terrible. They have guys working days out 
there who work nights at another job in town, and all they do at the Field 
is sleep so they will be rested up for their night job."   [*Salt Lake City Utah  8-5   (21)*]
