Dr. Carlton Smith
Chief of the Music Division
New York Public Library
New York City

Dear Carlton:

                    On Tuesday, April 29, I will be in Nashville, Tenn.
for the Fisk Jubilee; on May 2, San Antonio, Texas for the 
Texas Folklore Meeting: on May 16, at that wide place in the 
road, Clarksville, for my brother's first wedding; and after
that, until June 10, I will be in parts unknown. If June 10,
isn't too late, I'll be glad to do what I can to help your
show along.
                       
                      If the Archive of American Folk Song gets the proposed
funds for next year, I'm practically certain the Library
will back a study of National Minority Music in New York City,
headed up by you, Cowell and Sacks. We would expect to pay
for material costs, at least, and expect you to find financial
support for it after it got underway from the city or from
another place. I'll suggest that Henry Cowell come to see you
about it. Until the 10 of June, 

                                                         Best regards,
 
                                                                  Alan
