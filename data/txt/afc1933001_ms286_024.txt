our study, to arrange this material, to
classify it, to limit the field so that
we would know just what our material
and our field were.- to map the geographical distribution of
species, etc. Put the material in historical patterns,
relate to history, etc.

The second stage - since much of our material
was alive and kicking - was to
observe its life-process in its own environment -
to discover how the material
functioned, grew, decayed, etc.

The third stage - it seems to me - would
be to experiment with out material. To set
it up in various relationships, planned in
advance, to make predictions about the
outcome of these new relationships and to
attempt to verify the predictions
by observing the results of the newly established relationships.
