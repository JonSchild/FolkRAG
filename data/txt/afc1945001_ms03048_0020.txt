Philadelphia Office                             Report made August 15, 1942
Rumor Report - week of August 10, 1942
2. Unless you are vouched for by a German society, or unless
you are of German extraction, you cannot get a job in the textile mills
around Reading. Most of the mills are owned by Germans.
Reading--8/13/42. Railroad worker. American citizen of Irish extraction.
Excellent character.
3. German un-American activity around Allentown is getting
so bad that a W.P.A. educational project was ordered stopped by the
W.P.A. office, in Philadelphia, whose workers couldn't stand the pro-German
attitude in that area.
Allentown--8/11/42.
NOTE: (We checked with the W.P.A. office on this, and they told
us that they had to close a W.P.A. educational project in 
Coplay, Pennsylvania, because of the un-American activities
of the notorious Sanger Bund, which operates
in that area).

D. Rumors Concerning the War Effort
1. The "dollar a year" men in Washington are working with
the big steel companies and are seeking to establish monopoly
corporations.
I can prove this too. Why do you think Higgins' firm
couldn't get steel to make ships? Because Mr. Higgins had worked 
out a plan for building ships on a mass production basis, which
cheapens the cost and speeds up production. But this was a threat
to the old established shipyards, which were subsidiaries of the 
large steel companies, such as Bethlehem Steel, which are using
older methods.
Philadelphia--8/14/42. Business man, excellent character.
2. There are many machines in defense plants, and defense [*7b*]
plants themselves standing idle because hundreds of machinists are
being shipped into the Army by Draft Boards who don't consider [*1*]
anything except filling their quota.
Philadelphia--8/13/42. Defense worker. 42 years old. Average
intelligence.
3. It's just about impossible for a woman over 35 to get
a job in the defense plants here in Philadelphia, because the bosses
want young and pretty girls around the plants.
Philadelphia--8/12/42. Middle-aged housewife.
