I do not mean by this that the thing has become a fiasco. But
it may become one, and before it does steps should be taken to push
things along as rapidly as possible, either toward action or straight-forward 
cancellation. As late as April 6 Mr. Williams advised me that
"the plan is temporarily suspended, but the Washington agencies involved
have not abandoned it." Does this mean that we should continue to "sit
tight" for a while longer?
