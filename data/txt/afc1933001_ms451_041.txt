SPRINGFIELD MOUNTAIN

Springfield mountain, where I heared tell,
A likely youth I've known so well.

One Friday morning he did go,
Down to the meadows field to mow.

He mowed around, all around the field,
A pizen serpent tore on to his heel

His cries was heared both fur and near,
But none of his people did appear

Before some hunters the worker found,
The day went off and the night came on.

When Andrew Bailey went to seek his son
Was lying on the ground as cold as a stone.

His eyes and mouth was closed fast
His arms was folded crost his breast.

Go wrap him up in double sheets
Go raise him up both head and feet.

In eighteen hundered and sixty-one,
When this sad accident was done.

Oh, let this be warning to you all,
Let this be warning to both young and old.

Sung by Mrs. Lee Sheeans, Wooten,
Leslie County.  Octo 4, 1937
