Dr. Spivacke,
Division of Music,

In re, contribution of the Archive of American Folk Song
          in event on conscription.
     May I suggest that the total plan which I suggested in a memo
submitted to you some time ago be considered. The burden of
this memo was "to make it possible for the American people to
explain for themselves what America means and has meant to them."
The [?] words and the music have already
been made by the people and presumably they like it. It remains
for this program to put this material together and make it
speak for the whole people rather than for any special region or
group.
     If, however, it is not possible for us to embark on a total program, 
I submit the following suggestions for an immediate
and emergency conscription program.
     1) The AAFS can draw upon its large stock of tunes and songs
for material for song books for camps. These song books may be
designed according to the needs of the regions in which the camps 
are located, according to the racial and occupational make-up of the camps.
I feel, for example that where any large group of second-generation Polish
conscripts are located, Polish songs should be sung. The same 
for Negro, Mexican, Greek, Finish, etc.. conscript groups [?].
     2) I need not overstress my opinion that "God Bless America" and
Kate Smith are both extremely dull and mediocre. They have both been elevated
to an artificially astronomical position by the power of mass
advertising and the star system. One of our contributions to the integration
of the people and, specifically, of the conscripts would be to
find and help encourage all sorts of poetry, songs, and
talent of all sorts among the conscripts and to give it publication 
or a place to be heard. We can work through the NYA, the WPA Arts Program 
or whatever other agency will be concerned with the recreational activities
of the men to encourage and foster the poets and singers of the camps.
     3) I am not to narrow a specialist to realize that much of the material
with which I have to do, I mean folk song and ballad material,
possesses only an historical or scientific interest.
Many of the songs and tunes, however, possess remarkable
potentialities for adaptation into other more familiar or sophisticated
or contemporary idioms.
     There are great number of the romantic and delicate mountain
love songs and war ballads which, if adapted for such a singer as Maxine
Sullivan or Francis Langford, could have an extrodinary success. This would
mean a departure from traditional singing style and so on, but 
I believe, nevertheless, that the resulting songs would
be more useful than they are in Cecil Sharp's ten dollar treatise
on "English" fork songs of the Southern Appalachians.
     There are besides a great number of tunes which only need orchestra-
