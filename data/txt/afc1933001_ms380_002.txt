The Vision of Eddie Wesley
A Tale of God's Doings

[crossed out: Hell; handwritten above: shit]

I was called to preach. Yassuh! It were revealed to me in a vision.
How reveal? Tell yuh.

Been tellin me in the church what successful preacher I was. Dey
had even ordained me deacon. When I testify, dey say, I see through the [handwritten: text]
mo quicker and mo clearer than anybody. Jes let de preacher read through
a tex' an' I analyze it. So one night, you understand, I drempt it in
a dream that I was standing befo a big congregation an' I spread out my
arms an' they all kneel an' pray. I study bout that an' figger God call me
preach. So I study roun' awahile and decide to tes' my vision an' so I
prayed to de Lord to send me a sign, to send a burnin' star to the Eas'
an' mak' it stand there when I got up nex' mornin' for me to see. Well, suh,
I look out de door nex' mornin' an' there stood a great big star, brightest
in all the sky, just tremblin' an' shinin' there with light. I begin to study
an' worry 'bout that so de Devil he tempt me, say,"[crossed out], "say, "That ol'
star rise there every mornin'." Well, nex' mornin' I look an' there weren't 
no star. But ole Devil he say, "[crossed out], you got up late dis mornin'" An' so
the nex' mornin' I gits up at three clock an' I go in de dark on the
front porch an' set there all rop up in a blanket till sun-up but no star
come.

Den was when I tole de ol woman 'bout it an' she tell me, "Honey,
you better git to preachin'. God ain' gonna call no fo', five times."
But I tell her we want to make certain sho dat I is call an' so we make up
between us for me to pary to the Lord to show me the sign agin. That evenin
evening' I prayed again. 00000000000000 an' ol' woman was to be witness. [handwritten: arrow]
Nex' mornin' I got up an' [crossed out: wnet] in the kitchen an' was makin' de fire in the
stove when I hear ol' woman call from frong porch, "He did it. Lawd
have mercy, Lawd Have Mercy!" An' goin' on lak dat an' I rush out an' sho
nuff there is star burn bright in the East. My ol' lady want me to go [handwritten: to]
preachin' right away then an' tell evybody 'bout [illegible] God's sign. But
I say I'm goin' tes' God jes' one mo' time. Nex' night I didn' pray an'
mornin' after from three clock to sun-up , weren't no star.

I know then that God had put his sign on me an' had called me to 
preach. An' the ol' lady she kep after me [crossed out: 'bout]; scaid, you unnerstand.
But I didn' have no proper clothes for preacher. I couldn' read or write.
But it was mainly I [illegible] didn' have no high muckety-muck close. I know that
I start preachin' an' beggin' my congregations for a collection to buy me
clos, then pepole begin to say I'm preachin' fer money. An' I don' like
to do things like that noway. I likes to be my own man. Been used to it,
earnin' my own livin' since I was ten years old. So I tol' her soon as I
could git my cotton srop in an' lil money, then I buy me close an' go to
preachin' like God said. Well, suh, dat's where I made my mistake an' a 
turrible mistake it wuz, too. Wasn't mo'n three Sat[?iz] den tell dis trouble
come on me an' dey sont me down here. It was God done [handwritten: it]. Cause, when he 'cide
to do an' promise to do, he gonna do......

I was standin' in the[?x] short line near fellow mont' or two ago an' he 'gin
to cuss God an' he rip an' snort somethin' terrible, cussin' God evry which
way. I didn' eat no supper. Wasn' hungry no mo'. I got on 'way from that f[xxx]
feller an' turn aroun' an' [xx] look at him two, three time. When I got to 
the corner of the buildin' I peek arou'n [x] look at him every whichaway. I
watch him tell he go into supper. Well, dat night I prayed to the Lord for
that man an' you know ain't never heard him cussin' God since. [Crossed out: Hell; handwritten: Shit], naw.
