The rumors in this group were obtained from a Federal employee who is
very much interested in the Parent-Teachers work, and he promised his cooperation
for this five-day period. His findings are attached just as he brought them
in to us. He, too, realized they were not just what we were asking for, but
said these were actually everything he had heard since we contacted him for
his assistance.
