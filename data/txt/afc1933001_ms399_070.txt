Weevily Wheat (con'td)

Charley here, and Charley there,
And Charley over the ocean,
Charley he'll come back some day,
If he doesn't change his notion.

Charley loves good wine and ale,
And Charley loves good brandy,
And Charley loves a pretty girl
As sweet as sugar candy.

The higher up the cherry tree,
The riper grows the berry;
The more you hug and kiss the girls,
The sooner they will marry.

Over the hill to feed my sheep,
And over the river to Charley;
Over the river to feed my sheep.
On buckwheat cake and barley.

How old are you, my pretty little miss?
How old are you, my honey?
She answered me with a "ha-ha" laugh,
"I'll be sixteen next Sunday."

Charley he is pretty and sweet,
Charley he's a dandy;
Charley he can kiss the girls
So complete and handy.

Where do you live, my pretty little miss?
Where do you live, my honey?
She answered me with a sweet to be,
"In the loom house with my mammy."

Run along, my pretty little miss,
Run along home, my honey,
Run along home, my pretty little miss,
I'll be right there next Sunday,

Papa's gone to New York town,
Mamma's gone to Dover,
Sister's wore her slippers out
A-kicking Charley over.

Come, my love, and trip with me,
'Tis Monday morning early;
First my hand and then my heart--
'Tis true I love you dearly.
