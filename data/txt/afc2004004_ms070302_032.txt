Roll the Old Chariot Along

They sing anything with a bit
of a slow metre-
It's dying out as [I] more
mechanical means come along
There's only one chap now
(his wife's died & he's left the 
island - gone North)
He taught it to our gang of
quarrymen out here.
-
Inigo Jones used some of
this stone in his [counsel] banquet
hall - but quarry didn't 
really get going till C. Wren
started work on St Pauls
came from the East
