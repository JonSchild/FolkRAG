Mr. Richard Chase
Proffit, Virginia

Dear Richard:

Thanks for the information about
Horton Barker. I shall incorporate some of it
in the albums. Barker will receive two copies of
the records that he is allowing us to use. I
am delighted that your books are going along as
swimmingly as they should.

I looked over the folk festival program
but could not bring myself to attend even one
session, since they all looked even worse than
they did last year.

Cordially,

Alan Lomax
