Dear Barnicle:

Two questions: What was the name of the boat on which we 
sailed to Cat Island and back? What was the name of the 
lady at the Old Bite whom you fed during our stay there 
and who, besides, as you recall, was one of the Captain's 
numerous wives? These two pieces of information are going 
to be put on the Bahaman pictures which I have finally 
had mounted.

I have at last got a very good stenographer at the office 
and have the opportunity now to accumulate the background 
material that should go in with our recordings. An important 
part of that will consist of Georgia, Florida and 
Bahama stuff which I can still remember and which you have 
in your notes.

Would it be possible for you to lend the Library these 
notes, for, say, a month or two this summer, and return 
for this loan we could furnish you with a typed copy for 
your own use; and the notes, themselves, could be restricted 
in any fashion you care to stipulate. The same would 
be true for any or all of the Kentucky material you care 
to let out of your hands for the time being.

I feel a little bad about asking you for any more favors 
for the Archive, since you have done all of us many favors 
and we have never been able to give you the records you need 
so much for your classes. I think you know the conditions 
I have worked under. Things are beginning to move very rapidly 
here now and the first thing we will get is a dubbing 
outfit that will be parctical and ready to go in the next 
week or so. The first thing that the dubbing outfit will 
do will be to make you the duplicates that you need, and 
then my conscience will be a little less heavy with my 
obligations to you.

It seems rather likely now that the Archive will soon get 
a real duplicating set and perhaps we will be able to bring 
Charles Seger into the picture as director of the work here. 
You know what that means for me and what it will mean for 
folklore work in general in America. Among other things, I  
hope it will turn me back to freedom and the sort of life 
Elizabeth and I really like to lead. Of course, it may be
