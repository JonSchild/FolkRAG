The man on the frontier, on the farm, depends on his
animals, yarns about them, will fight for them, especially
his hunting dogs. Down in Mississippi the farm boys have a
song about Old Blue, who was a good old coon hound.

I raised a dog and his name was Blue,
And I betcha five dollars he's a good one, too.
Saying, "Come on, Blue, boo-hoo."

Shouldered my ax and I tooted my horn,
Gonna get me a possum in the new ground corn.
Saying, "Come on, Blue, boo-hoo."

Old Blue treed, I went to see,
There sat the possum on a 'simmon tree.
Saying, "Come on, Blue, boo-hoo."

That possum clumb down on a swingin' limb,
Blue barked at the possum, possum growled at him.
Saying, "Come on, Blue, boo-hoo."
