I.
To this event the ages ran: 
Make way for Brotherhood, make way for man!

II.
HOLD THE FORT

We meet today in freedom's cause,
And raise our voices high.
We'll join our hands in union strong,
To battle or to die.

Chorus:
Hold the fort for we are coming,
Union men, be strong!
Side by side we battle onward,
Victory will come.

See our numbers still increasing,
Hear the bugle blow.
By our Union we shall triumph,
Over every foe.

Fierce and long the battle rages,
But we will not fear;
Help will come whenever needed,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer.

III.
THE INTERNATIONAL

Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!
Arise, ye wretched of the earth,
For Justice thunders condemnation;
A better world's in birth.
No more tradition's chains shall bind us,
Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall!
The earth shall rise on new foundations,
We have been naught, we shall be all.

Chorus:
'Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his party.
The International Party 
Shall be the human race.
'Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his place.
The International Party 
Shall be the human race.
