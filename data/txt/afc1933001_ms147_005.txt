Dear Dr. Spivacke:

I want to express to you and to Messrs. John and Alan Lomax
the very pleasant and informative visit which I had.

As yet I have not had an opportunity to talk matters over
with Mr. Walker.  I hope to do so next week, and it is my
believe there should be some developments of interest to
both of us.

In all probability, there will be no reason for you not
permanently retaining the records which we shipped to you.
I shall settle this definitely when I talk to Mr. Walker.

Very truly yours,

R. P. Wetherald
