Dear Mr. Goldstein:

In answer to your letter of August 5, I would be
glad to grant you the options suggested in your
letter under the terms of the previous agreement.
I feel that the young white guitar players you
mentioned would made an interesting contrast with
the Georgia Sea Islanders but that they might be even
more interesting with John Lee Hooker or some other
guitarist, in which case we might work with the
idea of building a permanent company.  Perhaps,
though, you suggested these people because you
think they have good drawing power in your region.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
