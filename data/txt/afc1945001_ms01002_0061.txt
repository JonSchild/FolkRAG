4.

invasions of air raids, of military defeats, 
etc., are characteristic of this class. The 
recent air raid scares on both coasts are 
excellent examples.

c. Emotional coloring 

1. The wish rumor. Here the emotional expression 
is that of simple wish fulfilling. It 
narrates a happening or condition which the members 
of the group have desired.

Example:  A Japanese aircraft carrier was 
destroyed during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
Japanese destroyers, through faulty construction, 
capsized during maneuvers. 

2. The hostile rumor. This class expresses 
hostility against certain persons or groups. In 
time of war it is very closely related to the 
wish rumor since the wishes of the group are so 
centered upon successful aggression against the 
enemy.

Example:  Tokio has been bombed. The Germans 
are "dying like flies" in Russia. Hitler is 
a homosexual. Roosevelt is a paranoiac.

3. The anxiety rumor. This class consists of 
stories of a frightening and pessimistic character.

Example: America will never be able to recover 
the Philippines. New York and Boston 
will be bombed on New Year's Eve. We lost 
4 battleships at Pearl Harbor.

IV. What is the "personal equation" in rumor transmission? 
Individuals differ with respect to the types of rumors 
they accept, and with respect to their propensity to 
transmit rumors. We may safely assume that the pessimist 
tends to accept anxiety rumors, the optimist, wish 
rumors; that persons harboring a great deal of anxiety, 
whatever its source, are more susceptible to rumors 
than others; that idle, bored and disorganized persons 
will accept rumor and transmit it as a means for creating 
excitement and relieving monotony.

Although in any particular instance the motivation for 
passing on a rumor may be complex, we may note here 
several typical patterns.

a. Exhibitionism. This consists of drawing attention
