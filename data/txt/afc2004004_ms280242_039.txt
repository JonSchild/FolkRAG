mouth, like myself at the present moment. But I had a few pounds
and could do with a better horse. So there was an Irish traveller
there - he wasna a tinker. He'd a wagon, too, and kept a good-looking
lot of ponies - piebalds. So me and him had a deal that
day. I would give him 12 pound or 14 pound as I remember, - got a nice fat
cob, tried it out and all. It run up and down alright, got good
sound legs and everyhting - not much wrong with him. Good beast.
So I was there the whole week at the fair, got a good few pounds
playing up and down, because you can't go wrong at the Puck Fair
because people's mostly drunk for a week. But now I was there till
the last of the fair. The tinkers and gipsies moved away and as
people gradually faded away from the town, I was the last to
leave, because they always held me back - the counrtymen, to play
a tune for them, me being a Scotchman. I used to give them all
the highland tunes and such-like and they used to laugh - terrible
time. Oh, but well, they paid for it. But terrible boys for the
booze, used to drag me in the public house and try to force me to
drink whisky. All this carry-on. But I'd never drink too much - 
lost my senses maybe. But I go one morning out the wagon door
looking for the old horse down the boureen, as in Ireland you
call it - lanes in England - and begod, I couldn't find the old
pony at all. Now I was stuck there. I went away searching this
way and searching that way - looking for the old pony, but I
couldn't get it at all. Terrible. But the wife says to me, "Did you
get out last night?"
I says, "No, I just slipped up the backroad to a place up there."
"Up the boureen?" she says.
She said it couldn't disappear.
I said, "I dinna ken. I've been looking the past two hours for
it." Summertime, you know, but I thought the pony was stuck in
some old ditch or someplace. So I travels and takes the winklers
with me - that's the bridle in Scotland - puts it on my shoulder
and walks away up this road. Couldn't find no trace of the old
pony at all. O I went maybe about ten miles, and come back to 
the wife for a cup of tea. "No trace of the pony. I couldn't get
it," says I, "at all."
"That's terrible," she says.
Anyway, there's a car coming down - we were mostly staying at the
side of the road with the caravan - just across the road on a 
broad piece of ground. In Ireland there's no much restriction on
travellers or tinkers camping because they can camp anywhere in
Ireland. It's not like Scotland or England. This car was coming
down the road, and the man stopped and says to me, "Are you
looking for a pony?"
I says, "I am. A pony about 14 hands high. Thick cob. Short stumpy
tail."
"Away about 15 miles back the road," he says, "a pony standing at
the roadside along with a couple of donkeys. Maybe it's no your 
pony."
