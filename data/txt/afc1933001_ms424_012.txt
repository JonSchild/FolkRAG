THE INTERNATIONAL

(Sheet Music - Published by Rand School)


Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!
Arise, ye wretched of the earth,
For justice thunders condemnation,
A better world's in birth.
No more tradition's chains shall bind us,
Arise, ye slaves! No more in thrall!
The earth shall rise on new foundations
We have been naught, we shall be all.

Refrain: 'Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his place,
The international party
Shall be the human race.
'Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his place,
The international party
Shall be the human race.

We want no condescending saviors,
To rule us from a judgment hall,
We workers ask not for their favors;
Let us consult for all.
To make the thief disgorge his booty,
To free the spirit from its cell,
We must ourselves decide our duty,
We must decide and do it well.

Refrain: 'Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his place,
The international party
Shall be the human race.
'Tis the final conflict,
Let each stand in his place,
The international party
Shall be the human race.
