4. A soldier, a private who said he had recently been demoted from
sergeant, was overheard telling a group of young women that in his outfit,
a national guard unit, the company commander had just "busted" all non-commissioned officers in the outfit and appointed in their places draftees
who had been recently trained under the non-commissioned officers. He
said that an appeal had been made to the regimental commander by some of 
the demoted non-commissioned officers and that the Colonel stated that
the company commander had a right to take this action and that nothing
could be done about it. The soldier said that "there were plenty of 
fist fights" over the incident. He claimed that while he was sergeant 
he had been recommended by at least two officers as capable of performing
the duties of a commissioned officer. He said that the company was completely 
demoralized by the company commander's disciplinary action, and 
he insisted that the only reason the company commander had for demoting 
the non-commissioned officers was the officer's dislike of national 
guardsmen. 

5. On Wednesday, August 5, and on Friday, August 7, women shoppers
in two grocery stores were heard discussing what they characterized as 
"shameful waste" of food at Fort Jackson. One woman of middle-age who 
was buying meat on August 5 said a friend of hers working at Fort Jackson
had told her that he had seen practically a whole leg of lamb thrown
away on a recent Sunday because so many soldiers in the outfit were on 
pass and those remaining for dinner were unable to consume all the lamb
placed before them.
