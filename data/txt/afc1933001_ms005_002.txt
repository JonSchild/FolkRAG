JOHN A. LOMAX ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS DALLAS TEXAS
June 1, 1933

Dear Mr. Engel:

I am ready for the
field just as soon as I
can get a machine in
either Dallas or New Orleans. 
I can get the physics department
of a university
to check my machine
We will bring it with us
to Washington in our car. 
I'll notify you later just
where to send it. Perhaps
we had best try out both
aluminum and celluloid
records. About 25 of each.
