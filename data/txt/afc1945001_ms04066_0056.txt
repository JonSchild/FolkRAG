August 6 - The next comment was overheard in a bus on the way to
Lincoln. Two gentlemen were talking: One said: "Those saboteurs should have
been shot on the spot instead of taking up all the valuable time they have.....
..and maybe that's exactly what they want to do too......slow up our progress in
every way possible. Just think of all the time they have been given......it's too
bad it couldn't have been handled with more speed. We will have to pay with
some of our own boys' lives, but that is to be expected. They should deal with
them entirely different....shoot them and keep it out of the press." [*13*]
