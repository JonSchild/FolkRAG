a simpler mans folky idiom. You
sounded almost like [a] the wise-
cracking Howard Mumsford Jones of
Harvard and you blamed near
ruined the boll weevil song in
your hurried chase after the next
stanza. You forgot, too, that
this song, while jovial in some lines,
is also plaintive in tone. The
Negro makes a bid for your
compassion, prospectively he mourns
the lean belly left in the wake
of Mr. Boll  weevil. You'd
better listen to me again Christmas
after the fourth round of
egg-nog. Sing and talk as you
did for your friend Bill Kittrell
and beware of acquiring a radio
manner. In other words, don't get
frightened anymore. I could hear that
cold., too. You won't catch colds when
you sleep a-plenty. Relax!
