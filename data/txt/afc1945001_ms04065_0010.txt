Conduct of War.  Cont'd.
"There is a letter from a woman who signs herself Patriotic Mother.  She
is from Jewell, Iowa.  She says that she lives in a hotbed of people who are
criticizing the president.  He, they say, is lackadaisical about the conduct
of the war.  He stalls and we have lost the war in the Atlantic because of
his indecision.  However, Patriotic Mother doesn't believe these things.  She
is evidently very much for the president and is disgruntled by anti-administration 
talk."  Aug. 6 - Editor of Women's Page Column, Des Moines Tribune  Iowa 8
