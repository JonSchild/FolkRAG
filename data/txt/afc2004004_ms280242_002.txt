The Merchant and the Beggar's Daughter:
1) A merchantts son he lived in wrong,
To a-beggin' he has gone.
He mounted on a noble steed, a
And away with pleasure he did ride.
Chorus:
Fol-ol-di-dooral-aye-do, 
Fol-ol-di-day.

2) A beggar wench he chanced to meet,
A beggar wench with low degree,
He took pity on her distress,
And says, "My lass, you've got a pretty face."

3) They both inclined to have a drink,
Into a public house they both went. 
They both drunk ale and brandy, too,
Till the both of them they got roarin' fu'.

4) The both inclined to get into bed,
Then under cover they were laid,
Strong ale and brandy went to their head,
And both now slept as they were dead.

5) Later on, this wench she rose,
And putting on now this merchant's clothes,
With her hat so high and her sword so clear
She's away with the [gadjy's money] gadjy's lowee. ( man's money - tinker cant.)

6) Early next morning the merchant arose
And looking round to find his clothes,
There's nothing left into the room
But a ragged petticoat and a wensay goon. ( old-fashioned gown)

7) The merchant being a stranger to the toon,
He put on the old coat and goon,
And down the street he songly ( in a rage) swore, 
He would never lie with a beggar no more.

I learned it from my sisters and brothers.  My old father used to 
sing it.  It's a real tinkers' song.  There's no much tinkers bar 
the Stewarts and the Hutchinsons has that song.  There was some of 
those tinker girls was very good-looking.  They'd go away all day 
wiyh a basket, hawking, and one girl would say, "We'll have a 
little drop before we go home."  And there would be a ploughman
sitting in the pub, and he would buy something, studs or bootlaces, 
and then the girl would get a cigarette from him or a few shillings
to have a drink -- and they'd rob him of his money - and he 
couldn't say anything about it because he shouldn't be there
