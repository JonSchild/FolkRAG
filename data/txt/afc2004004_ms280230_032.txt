5) O ye shall gang in gay attire
Well buskit up saw gawdy,
And yin to wait at every hand
Gin ye'll  leave your collier laddie.
6) I can win my five pennis a day
And spend't at night full brawly.
And make my bed in a collier's neuk
And lie doon wi' my collier laddie.
7) Love for love is the bargain for me,
Though the wee courthouse shoold hauld me,
And the world before me to beg my bread
And fare for my collier laddie.

The Brewer's daughter:
1) A brewer's daughter who lived near,
As true a story as you shall hear,
Up to London she has gone
To look for service, and she's found one.
2) Her mistress having an only son,
And Bessie's heart he had fondly won,
And Bessie being so very fair
Has caught his heart into a snare.
3) Early one morning her mistress rose
"Come, Bessue, dear, put on your clothes.
Get your clothing and come with me,
A foreign country there is to see."
4) Two weeks later her son lay dead,
She tore her hair, she banged her head.
Come, you neighbours who all knew me,
I did this thing, but I rue it now."

Sur Hugh of Lincoln:
1) The rain rains down through Maryland town,
Sae does it in the Pao,
Sae does the lads of Maryland town
When they play at the ball.
2) Then oot and came the Jew's daughter,
Said, "Will ye come in and dine?"
"O I canna come in, I winna come in
Without my playfreres nine."
