"Look at what they're doing in Idaho -- taking the married men
already.  That doesn't seem fair when we've got single men in Utah and
other states who aren't in, but that's what they're doing -- taking
the married men in Idaho."
....

"I'm ready any time they want me but, brother, I'll raise a hell
of a stink if I go in, married , before they get guys like _______, _______
and ________ _________, who are single and have occupational
deferments."
.......

"Say, how do you guys like ______________ ___________ stay out of the draft?
He's single.  I understand the sugar industry had him deferred, had all
of their men deferred.  To hell with that noise.  If I fight , those
guys fight.  Let the women run the sugar industry."
....
"There's a lot of talk around this town about guys like _______
______ and  _________ _______ and _________ _________ keeping out of the
draft.  Hell, those guys should  have gone long ago.  What kind of a gag
are they working to get an occupational deferment in the jobs they're
doing?"
....

"Guess you've heard all the fuss about ________ __________ and _______
_________ staying out month after month just because they've got 
somebody pulling strings for them with the draft board."
