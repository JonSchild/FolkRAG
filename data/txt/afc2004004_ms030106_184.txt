If you don't shake, don't get no cake,
If you don't rock, don't get no cock.

I said, if you don't shake, don't get no cake,
You don't rock, you don't get no cock.

If you don't fuck, don't have no luck,
If you don't fuck, don't have no luck.

If you don't [fuck] ?, don't have no luck,
If you don't fuck, don't have no luck.

Invincibly cheerful, this music.
