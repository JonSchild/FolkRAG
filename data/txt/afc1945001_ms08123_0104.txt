1. Sentry: Halt - who goes there?"
Rookie: Oh, you wouldn't know anyway. I'm 
new here"

2. A couple rookies were talking about their 
experiences with mosquitos. One said 
"I was in the [feel] field down in 
the Guadal canal jungles when two 
of the smaller species of mosquitoes 
flew off with a team of horses that 
pulled our artillery gun. When we 
found them, they had eaten a 
horse apiece and were pitching 
horseshoes to see who would get 
the harness!"

3. One rookie said that his beautiful 
but dumb wife wrote him,
that after carefully figuring up 
her income tax, she found to her 
amazement that the government 
owed her money!

4. Sargeant: "So your feet were out from 
under the covers, eh?"
Rookie: "Yes, sir."
