1.  DETECTION AND ANALYSIS OF RUMORS

In order to deal with rumors, we need to know
certain things about them.

A. What?

What rumors are in circulation? Characterization
of rumors in terms of 1. content, (subject matter)
2. imputed source, (authority cited) 3. degree of
recognition as rumor by reporter, 4. intensity of
belief.

B. Who? Where?

1. Social groups accepting and diffusing the
rumor. Characterize groups according to:

a. Nationality
b. Race
c. Income
d. Education
e. Occupation
f. Connection with the war effort
(work in defense industries,
kin in armed forces, etc.)
g. Degree of contact with authoritative 
information sources.

2. Areas in which rumor is current.

a. Region
b. City
c. Proximity to strategic military,
naval or defense area.

C. How? Rumor Patterns - Origin, Growth and Death

How did the rumor start? Who started it? How
did it grow? How did it die?

Due to the degree of complexity of the phenomena
involved in "How" and the present limitations in
O.F.F. personnel, facilities and funds, it will not
be possible to do very much on (C. except in some
occasional tracings of the rumor to its source
(viz. Gustav Siegfried broadcasts, etc.). Later
on, more intensive investigation is indicated.
