As I pointed out above the whole basis of folklore
is democratic and the people know this instinctively. Besides, however,
all of the material worth considering in American folklore treats in one
way and another of democratic feelings, yearnings, strivings, struggles
which have always been part of the lives of our people. The American people
have developed a language for telling the story of democracy which is beyond the reach of pamphleteers and propagandists. Let the people
feel that they are telling themselves that democracy is worth defending,
and building and making their own. Don't tell the people that democracy
has brought them this or that and that democracy represents this or that
high ideal invented by philosophers;
let the people tell their own story to themselves in
their own way. This should be the bias, the leaning of any cultural
program at this time.
4) Specific Recommendations.
I) That a folklore division be set up in the Library of Congress
to carry out the following functions:
a) Research and indexing projects should be fostered and continued.
The
indexing projects initiated by WPA must be completed so that material
already available in print and on records will be easily available.
b) Large scale field work must be planned and set in operation so that
parts of the country that are unknown to folklorists may be explored
for material, singers and performers as yet unknown located, techniques of
community amusement further studied.
c) The results of the this research must be examined and
index with the needs of the defense program constantly in mind and this
should lead directly into creative work of all kinds, much as the
work of the Legislative Reference Bureau proceeds at present.
d) To plan, write and produce a number of documentary radio programs
and movies; to set up and publish a large number of mimeographed
compilations of material to take the place of the expensive collections
or the rare publications which take folklore materials out of the reach of
even most students once it is in print.
II) Certain Radio Programs Should Be Produced.
a) A program to be titled "LISTEN TO OUR STORY." A dramatization
of the local history of certain specific towns, communities, counties,
or cities based on documents in the Library of Congress. This program
is the be broadcast directly to an audience assembled
in the auditorium of the local library.
The rest of the nation may listen in if it wishes. This suggestion of the
Librarian's appeals to me as one of the most
successful ways of getting away from the coldness and impersonality
of al radio.
b) A program to be entitled "Out Our Way." A documentation of life
in America transcribed in the field with a sound truck and put together
at the dubbing table in the Library. A series of American
portraits drawn by the people and having the directness and the authenticity
of real people rather than actors and of fresh sounds rather than
sound effects. American can get acquainted with herself through a program like
