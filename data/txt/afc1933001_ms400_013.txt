Adventures of a Ballad-Hunter

cotton or did some other form of work in which it was not possible to 
adhere to a regular rhythm, his sons rose and fell with the free and
easy movement of his breathing. These songs were not designed for the
ear of the Lord, nor for the ear of the white boss. In them the Negro
workman was likely to speak his free and open mind. If he touches on
religion at all, his mood is likely to e at one extreme submissive
devoutness; at the other, a horse-laugh: 

Mary, Marthy, Luke and John,
All them 'ciples dead and gone.

He complains about the hot sun and his long hours:

Looky yonder, the hot broiling sun turnin' over,
An' it won't go down, Lawd, Lawd, it won't go down.

Got up this mornin' so doggone soon,
Couldn't see nothin' but the stars an' moon.

His throat dry and full of dust, he remarks:

Well, I b'lieve that water-boy musta been drownded
Out in the sea, Lawd, Lawd, out in the sea.

He shivers in the spring norther:

Told my Cap'n my feet was cold,
Goddam your feet, let the wheeler roll.

He remarks upon his poor pay:

Work all day and Don't get enough,
Buy my tobacco an' buy my snuff.

He reviles his faithless woman:

Won' cook me no breakfus', won' wash me no clo's
Lord, won' do nothin' but walk de road.

When I first met you, Mama, yo' dress was a great big hole,
Now I give you my good money an' I can't touch you with
a ten-foot pole.
