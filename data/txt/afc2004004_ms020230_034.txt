[*WHITE EMPLOYERS & WHISKIES*]
TL:    Bessie, what kind of liquor do most people you know drink?
When a guy wants to go out and drink in the evening, what does
he usually buy to drink?
BJ:    I don' know.  Because, you see, it been years an' years since
I drankted whiskey.
TL:    (?)
BJ:    Uh-huh.  An' I don' know what they change to now.  I don't
know what they doin' now.  Uh, but I do know it's, when I was in,
in that attitude an' out there amongst them, I know we [drinkin] drinkted
just -- they [drinkin] drinkted, an', an' everybody now I watches -- they
[drni] drinks it, jus' 'cordin' to what they like.  That's what I
think.  Accordin' to what they like to drink.  An' 'cordin' ta -- an'
then, sometimes, like, ah, y'all here now an' I know peoples I
used to work with an' been in their houses, I see they got all
kindsa diffrunt whiskey there.  'Cause most of 'em house set like
a barroom, ya see?  Um, an' um, an' hit's jus', ah, ah, you know,
so if somebody come, why they can serve diffrunt [kinds] things.  See,
in that way.  Ah, an' some of 'um, like Miz -- um, some white
folks I work for?  They don't have not nary a bit.  An' sometimes
they have one -- I know one lady I work with, she, they had a quart
a whiskey an' it['ll] last almost a year, ya see?  Because jes' certain
peoples that they'll offer it to.  'Cause they don't have it
in the house -- they, they don't drink it, themselves, ya know --
an' so that's just there an' certain times, somebody come in an'
they put lil' water with this glass. . .It done last, I don't know
how long, that one quart.  Then that quart was given to him; he
winned it. They winned that quart.  Don't have no money to waste
up on whiskey.
