INTERVIEWER    Who did the black fiddlers learn 
from?

MAN                   They learned from their masters and 
                             the foreman on the plantation and 
                             very early that they already their kind
                             of square dance, the Virginia Reel
                             is a black version of the square 
                             dance, a good deal livelier than the
                             somewhat more sober ______ dances and
                             they adapted this reel and jig to a 
                             far more sophisticated style, I mean
                             far more ____________ and jigging, they
                             synced them up, you know they synced
                             them up and they also played very 
                             heavily bowed rhythmic fiddle and one
                             of the things I found on this trip 
                             was a black fiddler and his banjo
[*Thomas Bros      playing brother who played the tunes
            NY.*]         as you will see in the style that
                              really pre-dates modern music in
                              many ways.

                              They knew the early version of Old
                              Joe Clark and the knew the early 
                              version of Lychburg
                              Town. (singing). .Going down town,
                              going down town, going down the
                              Lychburg town to sell my tobacco
                              down.
