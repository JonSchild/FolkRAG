TL:  Chinkey pin?  I don't know what that is.
BJ:  Well, that's a nut, you eats in the woods.  An' it grows up
an' you, an' you can jus' go out there an'
pick chinkeypins an', an' carry 'em home an', if they half-green,
you can put 'em in the stove an' let 'em parch like peanuts an' eat 'em; that's
all.  Just chinkeypins.  But they be's a lil' fuzz, a stickey,
lil', lil' thing.  An' then you open 'em; hit opens up.  An' they'll
fall out theyself, ya know, when time comes.  But if they're green --
you can jus' pick 'em when they're half-ripe, ya know?  An' then
eat 'em.  Jus' chinkeypins.

It's hard to git rid of.  They're nothin' but wild chewfers.  'Cause
my children pulls 'em an' eats 'em.  Since I told 'em what, what,

everything; got the same nuts [of 'em] on them. Yeah.  That's all.  Just,
just growin' wild, ya see.  That's all.  'Cause chewfers'll do the
