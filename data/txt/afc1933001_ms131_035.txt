4.
whether you would fine anything there that would make the
expense and trouble of the trip worthwhile. Wherever you
go, I sincerely hope you do find that!

    Before I stop, I'd like to ask one more question: has
anyone collected any significant amount of folksong from
the south-central part of Pennsylvania? There, it seems to
me, is a region of great importance. If a respectable
amount of stuff could be gotten from some colony of Scots
in that part of the state--in southern Lancaster County,
for instance--I should think it would throw a good deal
of light on what sort of pieces the Scotch-Irish have
carried with them and dispersed throughout the South in
their great migrations from central Pennsylvania thro'
the Valley of Virginia, and on southward. Perhaps nothing
considerable survives in that region nowadays--but I hop e
something might be found, and especially some tunes be
recovered. Has anything been done there?

    I wish this letter could have consisted of something
more definite than questions,and vague utterances about
what I should like to say in answer to your very kind invitation--
but as I am placed just now, I cannot say anything
else, than that I do not know how I am going to be able
to spend the summer. Perhaps I shall know more definitely
at some time in the near future. If so, I shall make haste
to write you; and in any event, I hope to be able to meet
you sometime soon.

    Yours very sincerely,
    Samuel P. Bayard
