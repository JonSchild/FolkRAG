Mr. G.P. Putnam
10042 Valley Spring Lane,
North Hollywood, Calif.

Dear Mr. Putnam:

In the absence of Dr. Spivack, Chief of the
Music Division, I am unable to give final answer to
your inquiry. I will leave your letter on his desk and
you may expect to hear from him by air-mail early next
week.

Duplicates of a small portion of the Library
collection have already been made. These records are not
satisfactory as high fidelity recording specimans because
many of them have been out on portable apparatus both as
masters and duplicates and besides they must be played
with an especial type of needle (either thorn or casein)
and with a light and flexible pick-up. If, however, with
these various disabilities understood, you still desire to
audition a group of records I see no reason why the
Archive should not draw upon its unrestricted list to lend
you a group of twenty records.

Tomorrow noon I am going away on a two months
field trip for the Archive and I shall leave a group of
twenty selected records in Dr. Spivack's care to be forwarded
on to you as soon as necessary arrangements can be
made. Of course, I am now aware of the use to which you
plan to put these records; but I think it advisable, if
your interest is in any wise commercial, that you consult
further with Sr. Spivack in regard to restrictions and
so on.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge
Archives of American Folk-song.
