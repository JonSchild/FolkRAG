HOW UNRRA BOLSTERED TITO     19

have been sending over to Yugoslavia,
Tito's regime has collected nearly
$6000,000,000 without cost to itself.
People must eat. They must have
clothes. They must keep from freezing
to death. UNRRA has supplied the
wherewithal, as I have shown earlier
in this article, to fill these needs adquately
for the 15,000,000 people of
Yugoslavia. But Tito, with the aid of
Russia and through our own blindness,
has taken over control of these
supplies.  With them he has re-equipped
and strengthened his army.
With them he has kept his own political
machine well fed, well clothed,

well house. With them he has plundered
the people of Yugoslavia, forcing
them to give up their belongings
and their freedom to keep alive.
And while he has been doing this,
his army of propagandists has conducted
a violent campaign against the
United States and the other Western
democracies.  When hungry people
protested against the high prices they
had to pay for food, clothes and medicine,
his government-controlled newspapers
said, "Well, there is capitalism
for you! Isn't it terrible to think that
rich Americans should force us to pay
such outrageous prices!"


TOLERANT

BY LOUIS FRANKLIN OVERSTREET

WITH alien gods
I walk along
the zig-zag path
of darkness
and of light,

and see about me
everywhere
sweet magic
I never glimpsed
in youth--

when I was single-minded
and knew I knew the Truth.
