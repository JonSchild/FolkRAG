Here's another verse of Mary Jane's "Who Built the Ark?"

I love this one, the "er" is necessary:

Says er po' sinner man or you runs away
Er but you got to come back er at de
Judgerment Day
Er you gotter go 'fre dem bars of God
The balance is dare er you must be weighed
Er says offer you balance dem balances too low
Says er down in er hell you show will shorely go
My Lord, Who Built dis ark, Nora, Nora, Lord!"

(Then something about - digging a grave with silver spade
And a link of chain for to link er me down
Er in de winding sheet for ter mind wind me up
Er friends all standing round
Dirt come tumblin' down and de coffin sound
Er in de creepin' things was on de ground.
My Lord, who built this ark, Nora, Nora!

I just adore that one and I'm crazy for you to hear it. So
many verses I can't recall half. Then there's another song they sing:
"Didn't You Hear my Lord Call" - something about no evil in my soul, etc.

Sincerely,
