Mr. John Avery Lomax,

    Washington, D. C.

Dear John Avery:

    Alice and I are carried away by the gift you have
made us of the lovely edition of your book of songs. We
appreciate the value of the gift and your spirit of affection.

    Since seeing you in February I have been out of
town and have been very busy with my office business. The
matters which you wrote to me about regarding folk music
in our military camps has been considered by the proper
authorities in the War Department and something along that
line will be made effective for the purposes you suggest.
Please give our love to Miss Terrell and accept the assurances
of Alice and myself that we want to see you whenever you are
again in the city.

    Very sincerely yours,
    Ike
