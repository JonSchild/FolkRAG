September 10, 1940
Dear Father:
     My vacation has been somewhat interrupted to say the
least. I've put in seven working days out of the first two
weeks, but this one I'm going to stay out of town. The enclosed 
letters of permission, all call for your attention.
I suggest that you go hard with Mr. Seigmeister, keeping
Mr. Beck, who gave you the song " O Meeshegan" in mind and that
you go easy on Lehmer. He's a nice young and important
musician who works with Roy Harris--Harris is No. 1 American
composer and a completely loyal Lomax fan.
     The Program hasn't sold as yet, but will be definitely 
sold before the first of October. We made a great hit. The
job which neither you nor Bess not Deannie could make anything
of is a job in the Library of Congress Radio Project as folklore 
and folksong consultant at a considerable advance in salary.
This will come through the end of October, but it's not completely
certain yet.
     Buy Bess a tuning fork and strike it in front of the microphone 
before every record is begun. This is very important
and is a suggestion of Harold's. Also remember in recording
Negro signing, to try to get a picture of the various parts of
the harmony by changing the position of the microphone so that
each singer's part is recorded over and against the other.
Elizabeth is calling and I'm going home.
Much love,
Alan
