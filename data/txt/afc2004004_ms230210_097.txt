Vieux Fort.   VIII
1)  Libert, Libert-o   ,                        conte told by Vitalis Victor.
              Begins with song as above. The story is about a girl 
who didn't want to love anyone. Her mother agrees--whatever
is your wish is my wish. Then she changed her mind and she
married Libert , but the king got interested in her. Whilst
lying next to his wife, Libert someone calling...

               Libert, Libert-o...
Then Libert opened the door and he turned into a mule. He placed 
his front and back legs in position and then he farted. His
 wife said, "Aye aye aye."
           Libert, Libert-o.
Now Libert is turned into a mule, he can't answer. He can only 
say...
          um-um----
Libert farted again and then he fell down on the pitch(road).
And he begins to sing...
           Aye- yi-yi congo   gilon,
                  [St] Jubilant  (Victor then improvises)
      The wife is dancing with her husband... t e mother does not know...
she opens her dress... O my husband( obviously copulation is occurring
...o Omy darling wife...Madam is groaning...It feels like he's usin 
his four hooves... My mother did not want you to be my husband...
