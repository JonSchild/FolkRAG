I'm All Out an' Down
[Becky Dean]

Sung when we was chillun. Used to be a li'l' boy come to
mama's house an' he could' set down without he begin to
sing that song.

Honey, I'm all out an' down,
Honey---.

Mules an' de hosses, nicklin' for dey corn an' hay,
Wimmen in de bottom, shoutin' 'cause it's mos' pay-day.
Oh, Lawdy,
Oh, Lawdy,
or,
Oh, Baby,
Oh, Baby.

I'm goin' tell you like de Dago tol' de Jew,
If you don' want me, baby, I don't want you.

Women in de bottom, holl'in', "Wo-haw-gee."
Men's in de levy camp, holl'in', "Doncha murder me."

When I was skinin' for Johnny Ryan,
I would put my 'nitials on that mule's behin'.

The he looked around and this is what he told her:

I'm broke, baby, an' I ain't got a dime.
Ev'y good man, get in hard luck some time.

"I'm goin' to town, what you want me to bring you back?"
"Bran' new pair shoes an' you a bran' new Stetson hat."

Ain' but the one thing I want you to do, 
Want you to treat me, mama, like I do you.

I'm goin' away, baby, won' be back 'til fall, 
Find my rider, won' be back stall.
