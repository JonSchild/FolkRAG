I.  Rumor No. 9 was heard in Bristow, Oklahoma, August 6, 1942.
1.  "I was talking to a man who has been working in that Air
Depot in Oklahoma City.  He told me that a fellow carried
the same two-by-four ( 2"x 4") in and out of buildings and
around the yards so long it was getting slick.  Sure looks
like they would put those people to work if they are going
to pay them such un-Godly wages."    [*(19)*]
