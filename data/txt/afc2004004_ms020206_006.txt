Reverend Roe  -  Reel  3  -  P.  5

it lift you up and you just can't help it. Sometimes, I was preaching here
some time ago one night, and I don't know, I just got lifted up, and the 
people come up there to sit me down, stop me. I hadn't been preaching
unusually long,  but the people begun to shout, you know, and go on.  And I've
seen on several occasions when they stopped the preacher, when the people
just get shouting and going, you know, and they have to stop him and sit him
on down so they could keep the people quiet or they'd hurt one another.
But I believe this emotionalism, some call it, but now I don't know about
that, when the Holy Spirit came down on the Disciples, on the day of
Pentecost, they was cuttin' up terrible, they said they's drunk, they drunk
on the wine, drunk on the wine (laughter).
[*Spirit of God makes you drunk.*]
A: Hadn't had any wine.
R: Hadn't had any wine. And they wasn't have any saloons. So they's something
to it, there's something to it. I believe the spirit of God gets on, and 
here's another thing about it:  you may doubt some things and be afraid of some 
things; but when that spirit gets on you, it makes you bold. You'll just go
on and say it, that's all, if it's the truth. And you notice, it was so with
the Disciples; it was so with Daniel; it was so with the Hebrew children.
That's something, and the faith of God held them up, and they talked and they
stood up. They put um in the lion's den and in the fiery furnace, but that
didn't change them. Their faith was so firm in the God they believed in until
the lion didn't bother them, the fire didn't burn them  --  yes, sir, so there
must be something to it.
A: Well, there is something to it.
[*Spirit of God brought Rev. Roe a long way*]
R: There must be. I know one thing; it has brought me a long ways. I know I
have nothing behind me to help me; I didn't have no college education. What
little I had, I just picked it up along, three months schooling,  you know I
