and plants which are bravely producing 
war materials. But most outstanding 
among us is the negro boys who 
are fighting to help keep this a free 
country. This war will decide for us 
negros whether Christian Church 
as an institution will survive. This 
war will decide whether negro Americans 
will have the right to continue their
much earned freedom or will sink into 
slavery.
This can be no question as to where 
anyone of us stand in this grave world 
crisis. The democracy which the United 
Nations fight to preserve has its deep 
foundation in the principles of Jesus
Christ. Our nation is builded on 
Christian principles. We stand behind 
our nation and our people for victory 
over Hitler and Slavery.
