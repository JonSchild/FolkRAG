tors, writers, and directors for
stage, screen, and radio, it might
not be long before someone else
would hit on the same plan. Without
further delay we went out and
obtained options and contracts 
with all the leading folk singers
of the country and began to make 
active plans for an immediate 
shooting schedule."
   The ten shorts to be made (they 
will run about ten minutes each)
will include the backgrounds of
such songs as Southwestern ballads,
mountain ballads, mountain
dancing, both white and negro spiruals,
work songs, Arkansas Traveller 
songs, colonial songs, frontier
songs, and even the well-remembered
"blues" songs. As each
is made, a location will be found
that will most closely approximate
the setting in which the original
was popularly sung. Brandon
thinks he can get all of them right
in Rockland County.

Will Geer in Cast
    Among those taking part in the
first film, "Tall Tales" is Will Geer
of "Tobacco Road" fame. Geer is
now a resident of Rockland County.
He and his wife are building a 
home on the Stetler place on Brewery
Road, Clarkstown. Geer played 
"Jeeter Lester" for the last two
years of the show's run in New
York City. Burl Ives, a featured
singer for CBS who appears on the 
"Wandering Stranger" program
now, Josiah White, guitar and blues
singer, and Winston O'Keefe, an 
Irish-Texan who has colelcted and
sung Southwestern ballads for
years, are others.
   Co-director with VanDycke is
William Watts, stage, movie, and 
radio director. The former was director
of a documentary film called
"Valley Town" and has directed 
numerous educational and commercial
short subjects. Van Dycke also
assisted in the direction of another
famed documentary film,
"The River," and helped film and

direct an equally well-known picture
"The City." All these are in
the tradition of showing authentic
backgrounds for unadorned stories
of human life and customs.

Others Take Part
     The chief camera man is Herbert
Kerkow and the sound man
and editor is Irving Lerner. Upon
the completion of this series of
folksong shorts Lerne is slated to 
leave for Hollywood. The scripts 
for the ten shorts are written by
David Forrest, a veteran radio and
individual film company script
writer. Facilities for the production 
are by the Documentary Film 
Pictures, Inc., and the locale for
the first film furnished by Myron
Dulmer, owner of the farm.
   In making such a film, dependent 
as it is on continuous good weather,
a lot of funny as well as heart-
breaking things can come up,
Brandon explained. There is always
the breathless moment when, 
with everything in readiness and 
the camera trained on the tableau
being enacted, a stray dog, cat, or
chicken wanders unconcernedly on
the "set." All hands have to drop 
their work to shoo the unwanted 
extras away.

Schedules Conflict
   Each day presented a new problem
in itself, particularly when
O'Keefe and Ives were scheduled
to appear on different radio programs
a half-dozen hours apart.
The shooting schedule had to be
made up to fit the wild dash to and 
from the George Washington
Bridge and the radio broadcasting
studios. O'Keefe was ordinarily 
due to step before the mike at
11:45 o'clock, Ives at 5:45 o'clock 
each day. One day, as Burton recalls
it, four scenes had to be 
shot within the span of time between
the time O'Keefe could arrive 
at the Dulmer Farm and the
time that Ives had to leave.
   Despite the fact that the weather
reports all indicated "cloudy with
showers," Cameraman Kerkow set 
up anyway. Finally everyone was
on hand. They went through their 
rehearsals while Lerner fiddled
with the sound equipment in a
portable recording room in a station
wagon.
   It grew darker and darker.
Thunderheads piled up on the
horizon and distant flashes illuminated
the farm. Then, miraculously,
the storm swept aside, the sun
came out, and with little time left
they were able to take the four 
scenes before Ives leaped into his 
car and dashed for New York.

Sideline Support
   The hands at the Dulmer dairy
grew so interested in the business
of movie-making that frequently 
they deserted their ordinary tasks
to look on in silence as the four
men, all clad in farm costume,
overalls, and broken shoes, went
through their rehearsals and the 
scene.
   The scene for "Tall Tales" was 
taken in the farmyard of the Dulmer
Farm. It was taken against 
the background of a huge barn,
the doors swung open. To the right
was a huge silo scarred and
weatherbeaten, to the left a hay
mow. To the right of the spot
where the scene was enacted was
the milk shed, for the purposes of
the film transformed into the cook 
shack of a southwestern ranch. A 
dishpan and a drying shirt, together
with several ancient wooden
chairs, and a horseshoe pitching
court completed the set.

Last Scene Taken
   The director and his assistant,
together with Louise Barlow, the 
script girl, conferred about the 
camera as the final scene of the
men singing was being taken. the
singers and actors kidded each 
other as the waited to begin work,
Ives meanwhile tinkling out a tune
on the guitar. White struck up an
old hymn, "Throw Out the Lifeline",
and Ives and Geer were
quick to join in.
   Director VanDycke finished his 
calculations and called the group 
to get ready. Ives strode up to 
the peg closet to him, grabbed a 
horseshoe, and tossed it at the
other stake, near the camera. He 
wasn't supposed to make it. A disgusted
look came over his face. A
second later White tossed him the
guitar and asked him to "sing a
song instead."
   He stepped over to the chair, 
put one broad foot on it and broke
into a song while the other two
smiled their approval. "O.K., cut,"
called Director VanDycke. The 
camera stopped whirring and that
scene was "in the can."

Other Films to Follow
   Shortly, if all goes well, this
scene will flash back from the 
screens of the nation's theaters as
a part of the entire film. And, if
acceptable to the public, the other
nine films will follow in short
order. Its first showing, however,
will be to the Dulmer family and
friends, right in the barnyard
where it was made.
   If the entire series is successful, 
a feature production embodying an 
entirely new approach will go before
the camera, according to
Brandon's present plans. In the
meantime, says Brandon, if any 
resident of the county has an idea
for a location in Rockland that will
fit any of the songs to be made,
he or she is invited to inform
Brandon through The Journal-
News.
