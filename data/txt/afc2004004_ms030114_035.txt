You don't do like your teacher tell you - you got to take some advice
from somebody - know what you got.
Q:  In church why can't you sing blues?
A:  Folk music and blues is a whole lot of differences.  That's like your
singing some type of love-tet.  If you do like the people wants yo uto do
you won't do NOTHING - you know that.  Folk music is kind of like a love tet-its
telling a story.

Talk about the blues that leads you to the point of where a person
is worried about somebody.

On LITTLE BOY WHO MADE YOUR BRITCHES:  that's an old fiddle tune.
I heard that when I was a child.

Q:  Tell me more about Blind Boy Fuller?
A:  I didn't know too much about him but I met him several times.  I couldn't
get into the "in times" about the life of him.  He was a very nice
fellow to me - all like that - nice fellow to meet.
He made good money singing on the streets.
Q:  Where did you stay when you came up with Fuller to New York.
A:  We stayed on the corner of 133 and 7th avenue.
Q:  Did you like that recording session?
A:  I didn't enjoy it too well and I enjoyed it alright too, I couldn't 
hardly catch on to it until latter on.
Q:  How did they run the sessions.
A:  They'd give you beer to drink but I didn't want any liquor.  I played a steel-bodied
guitar.
Q:  Why didn't they ask you back to record.
A:  I'll tell you, there was a difference between me and the "man".  He
paid the rest of them but didn't want to give me all of mine.
That was the difference.
Q:  What about CARELESS LOVE?
A:  Knewla Jackson put that out.
Q:  How about Blind Lemon?
A:  No I couldn't tell you anything about him.  I heard his records.
Q:  Big Bill Broonzy?
A:  I met Big Bill Broonzy one time before he died.  I was up there in
Harlem, 125th street.  Brownie Mcgee had a music studio.
I didn't have no opinion about Big Bill, 'cause I found he was fine.
Q:  Willie Walker?
A:  I knew Willie Walker you see.  We all lived in the same city together.
Greenville, South Carolina.  He was a master guitar player.  I didn't ever
learn his piece.  He was also a good singer.  Most I heard him play was the
blues like Crow Jane.  Him and Simmie Dooley both were good guitar players.
Simmie Dooley, he lived in Spartenburg S.C.
Simmie Dooley played with Pink Anderson.  I met Simmie several times.
He could play the guitar good too - though not like Willie Walker.
I ain't never heard anybody on a record yet beat Blind Blake on the
guitar.
I like Blake because he plays right sporty.  Lemon plays like he wants somebody
to feel sorry for him.
