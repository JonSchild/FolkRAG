Chester:  Well, I didn't have no profession, but I grew up
in the country, first my name, Chester Wooten, and I
grew up in the country, went to school in the country. I'd
go to school in the morning, a lot of times, me and the boys
would play hookey after we got to the schoolhouse, we'd go
in the woods and stay til school was over. That's how I
got my education. We just had a good time in school--
Sometime we would get into fights before we got home, got
my nose smashed, and I'd be bloody when I get home. But
we had a good time. We grew up during the Panic, had hard
times. But we would work hard in the fields, come in at night.
We'd all get out on the porch after we eat supper, get out
on the porch and my daddy'd start singing and we'd join in,
and we'd sing til bedtime. Lot of time, our neighbors would
drive in and help us- we'd have a singing before we went to
bed.
