Wa hington, D.C..

Dear Duncan,

The delay in copying the material I ordered was so
considerable that I had forgotten the whole matter and had made
a lot of complicated and difficult and expensive arrangements
to find substitutes for what I would never receive from the
Library of Congress.

Would you then be able to hold the records and the
check I sent until I determine my present position and needs?
Let me know if this presents too great difficulties.

Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
