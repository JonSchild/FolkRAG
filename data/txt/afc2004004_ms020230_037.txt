TL:    Is that what you make for yourself?
BJ:    No.  I, I makes the medicine; if I want that t' be in there,
I put it in there to keep from sourin'.  But I don't. . .
TL:    What do you make that medicine out of?
BJ:    [Jus'] Diffrunt things, whatever, 'cordin' to whatever I make it for.  You
can make it for cold; make it for just, for, for your health; or
ya can make it 'cause ya think ya need it; you. . .jus', jus' what
I think I want.  But I know diffrunt herbs.
TL:    Each one's different, according to herbs, right?

a person should remember to do is to have a stomach full, of
food,an' that hangover won't worry 'em or anything.  'Cause they
have sumpin' to feast on.  [Just anything] That's the main eatin', [an'] to have sumpin'
in you.  But you take them peoples don't be et nothin' an' tired
an' systems runnin' down an' everything, an' that stuff'll kill ya.
