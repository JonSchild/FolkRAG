Dear Mr. Spivacke:
Your letter of August 14 on my desk when I returned
at the end of August.  I am still interested in obtaining
a copy of "O Gott Vater Wir Loben Dich."  On the other
side of the record I should like "Froelich So Will Ich
 Singen," or perhaps it would be better to leave it to 
your judgment to select a number quite different from the 
first mentioned above.  I believe the latter is merely a 
repetition of the same theme carried through the first 
two lines.  I am particularly interested in securing a 
hymn used in connection with the Amish communion service. 
 Mr. Lomax may have recorded that one.  I presume that it 
is impossible to secure a record on an aluminum or steel
disk at present; hence, I will be happy to receive any 
type of recording available.
Sincerely yours,
John Umble
