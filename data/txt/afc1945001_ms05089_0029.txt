" Something must be wrong with our planes, seems like every day 
I read about more army and navy plane crashes. It's a shame. I would 
hate to be father of one of the air corps boys as long as the papers
continue to print about every crash. It would not be so bad if they 
would not print that stuff." Minneapolis, August 5. [*43*]
