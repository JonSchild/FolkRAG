Q. What was the first tune you all published?

Q. tell us about this.
M. Someday Sweetheart was a tune that an old racetrack friend of mine,
Kid North - he only could play one tune and he told me that I could
have the tune since he found that I was a writer and we had been
friends then for quite a while. He was the former trainer of Joe
gans, the old champion from Baltimore. Then he had been in race track
business for a long time.
     The title of the tune that he wanted to give to me - which apart of
it was taking for Someday Sweetheart, the title was named Tricks Ain't
WaLkin No More It went something like this. I don't remember the words.
Of course, I can't sing anyhow. I always have to clear my voice. Whiskey's a
swell thing. (sings)
Tricks ain't walking no mo (2)
Every time I see that woman
She meets me, 
I'm gonna tell you, she's got that lovely [*fee?*]
But Tricks ain't walking no more
Why they're passing right by that whore.
I've never seen things so bad before
Cause Tricks ain't walking no more,
I'll tell you, tricks ain't - etc ...
Aw (scat)
I want you to be mine
If you'll come with me and be with me
I'll love you all the time
So won't you be mine?
I'm gonna take you to grind
Just then her man would come
And would run
That would be the end for me
(2) Cause Tricks ain't walking no more
