about.  (But you learned how, even out in the country, how
to get about by yourself)  That's right.  How to travel.
I'd go so far, you know, every day, until I learned how
to go all the way to where I wanted to go to.  I travelled

of rapes an things.  You know?  Men look on women and
wish to have 'em.  All such things like that happen.
All such things.  Well, no you know, there wan't no cause for
that.  The Bible tells us that Man made to ask, and Woman
made to deny, of she want to.  Then too, Man should not want
everything that his eyes see.  An you have read the papers
