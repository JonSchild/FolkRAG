Dear Sir:-

Your program is
interesting, so I would like to
do my bit in helping it to continue
to be so.

There is a lady at 79 [Please]
Pleasant St. Auburn, Maine,
who has a nice voice for a
woman of her age who knows
ever & ever so many old
songs that they used to sing
in Aroostook Co. Me. when
she was a girl. She is now
nearly 67 years of age.  She
is a sweet, nice looking, refined,
jolly, stout lady.
