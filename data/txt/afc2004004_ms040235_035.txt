new creation of his own, which is South
Down with a difference. Just listen to
this:

I work in a famous factory whose story you may know;
In one united action we laid the bosses low;
And from Greenland's icy mountains to Injy's coral strand
The strike we had a Duple's was the finest in the land.

The bosses aimed to cut our pay and break the Union's back
And one fine day the active blokes were told they'd got the sack
but twice five hundred workers said "For this we will not stand;
"We'll strike at Duple's Bodies for the finest in the land."

Each week the local news came out and put the bosses' case
So we went to see the editor and made him show his face.
"You're just a bunch of reds" he cried and waved a lily-white hand
But the lads who struck at Duple's were the finest in the land.

For eight long weeks we fought it out and kept our kids alive,
They told us they would lock us up under order Thirteen O Five.
But eight unions stood together in one united band
So the strike we had at Duple's was the finest in the land.

In years to come the engineers'll remember and they'll say
"What they did at Duple's, well we can do today.
Yes we can do the same as well, its plain to understand
Though the lads who struck at Duple's were the finest in the land.
