Beyond the head, Beyond the Law - 

"How well for the birds that can rise in 
their flight
And settle together on the one bough at
night
It is not so with me and the boy of
my heart
Each morning the sun finds us rising apart -

Song of a Seduced girl from Galway - 
Arise and put a fence about the field you
spoiled last night
If the cows get in the meadow, 'twill go
hard upon the grass

People who believe in fairies - who
have the mystic vague gift of poetry
are as wiley as can be imagined

Whiskey salesman knows how much
poteen is being brewed by the quantity 
of his orders.
