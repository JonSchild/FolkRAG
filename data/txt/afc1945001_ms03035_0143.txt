RUMORS IN DETROIT, MICHIGAN
Reported by Bert M. Grim

A member of a club at a luncheon in the Fisher
Building stated that he had been given good information
that there was absolutely no tire
shortage necessary; that we have plenty of tires
and rubber to last five years if the government
would quit playing politics with the large rubber
companies and allow the synthetic rubber to be
produced.

He stated that one could buy all the tires if the
right parties were contacted and the gas rationing
was merely a bluff and would never be put into
effect in Michigan, and he said that one had to but
look at the traffic which is just as heavy now
as it had ever been and no one even the officials
themselves were paying any attention to the government's
request to conserve on tires and rubber.

This man was a small manufacturer and failed after
war was declared due to the fact that he could
not get materials. He seemed to be a good citizen
with possibly a little bitterness thru his recent
experience.
