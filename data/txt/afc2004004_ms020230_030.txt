what it was made of.  That's what it is.  So that's the way to make
whiskey.
         And in dis pipe, you know, where it run down, you got to 
have a, let it run through a trough or through a tub or through 
sumpin' where water comes to keep the pipe cool.  Ya see?  If ya 
don't, ya gonna git it scorched whiskey; the whiskey'll be schorched.  
Taste funny.  You see.
         An' let it run -- [Hit] I mean, hit'll run on out here.  An' you put 
sumpin' down here to ketch [it with] the sweat.  Just natchully sweat, that's all.  And when it sweat, sweat, sweat until it gets where it's weak, then
you know it's done run out.  See?  You can let some a that weak 
sweat go with that strong, 'cause that first, you cannot drink it.  
Ya can cut it in two; 's too strong, see?  That why they ha' to let it. . .
they call it "low wine."  So much so. . .Some folks call it "seeped (?) 
whiskey" 'cause they got a whole lotta run in there an', see, 
there's a whole lota. . .mixed it together.
