Convocation Is
'Community Sing'

Lomax Discusses
U.S. Folk Music

With his audience contributing
to the singing, Alan Lomax, assistant
in charge of the archive of
American folk song at the Library
of Congress, initiated the University
into the "easy art of folk
singing" at yesterday's convocation.

Promising not to get them into
very serious difficulty, Mr. Lomax,
accompanying with guitar, taught
the audience choruses of the "Ballad
of the Boll Weevil," "Long
John" and "Goodbye Old Paint."

Prior to the song-fest, the
folk-musician soloed with a New
England ballad, satiric love
songs and lumberjack ditties. He
also sang a ballad, popular
among the Okies, about Pretty
Boy Floyd.

"Although it is the common belief
that folk songs are no longer
being sung, in 7 years 20,000
songs have been collected from a
'musically sterile' country," Mr.
Lomax said.

"Folk songs and folk lore are
essentially democratic. They grow
by accretion and result in the concentrated
essence of what the people
believe," he concluded. "This is
a democratic process and important
for us to know when democracy
is threatened as it is today."
