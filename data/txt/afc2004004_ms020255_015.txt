BJ: Oh, yeah, uh-huh. 
AL: But wouldn't he have to go to the devil for help to do that? 
BJ: Oh, oh, sure. That's sellin' your soul  out to the devil.
That's right. You sol' out to the devil. 
AL:  How do you actually -- how do you do that?
BJ:  You kin sell your soul out so many ways.  I was tellin'

their soul, years ago, you know, ta, ta the devil.  Killin'
