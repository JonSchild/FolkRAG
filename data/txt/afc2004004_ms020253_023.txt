TL:  Now what's this?  It's all about...?
BJ:  My married life.
TL:  Your married life?  But why didn't people know that you
were married.  How did this work, exactly, in the beginning?
[*1ST WK. OF BJ's 2ND MARRIAGE*]
BJ:  Well, it jus' [was] work like I tol' ya.  Um, when we first
was goin', startin' to goin' together, I was cookin' for them
already, ya know, before I even got the Holy Gho!
An' so when ah, an' then they begin to talkin', talk like that
I was, ah, doin' other things with 'im.  But I wasn't, ya
understan'.
TL:  The people around town?
BJ:  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  An' his, his, ah, brother an'
his sister-in-law, ya know, all them was[I] talkin', ya know.
That is to throw me, 'cause they didn't think I was goin' to
get no husband nohow, ya know?  An' everybody thought I was,
I suppose, I was lyin'.  An' so they was just kinda outdone
about that anyway.  The devil!  That's just the devil stirs up
things, ya know.  Anyway, they jus' kept on jabberin' an'
jabberin' an so.  Well, that Saturday when I an' George -- when
George got ready to marry -- I an' George was, got ourse'f prepared,
ya know.  An' he come up to me.  We -- I was cleanin' fish,
gettin' ready to sell fish that night for the church, as we
usually does.  An' ah, he walked there an' tol' me to come an'
go with him.  An' I got to the car; he had borrowed our Pastor's
[*(THE WEDDING)*]
car.  When I got to the car, I asked him where was he goin', he
said, "Come on, I'm goin' to 'Chobee to marry ya."  But nobody
down here, ain' told nobody right, right there; girls that
he'p 'im an' everything with the fish, they didn't know it.
Said, "Come on."
