archivist rather than merely as an
Honorary. If this is not the proper
time to bring up such matters or should
you prefer for any other reason not to discuss
them, please pass up this section
of my letter.

I wish you could 
happen by to enjoy some
of our novel experiences
with these interesting people.

I write this letter in
my lap on the road, under
conditions not conducive
to satisfactory correspondence.
Pardon my prolifity.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
