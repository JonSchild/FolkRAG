Evictions in Gweedore -1
Father James McFadden
-
The people subscribe to have 
a stonecutter go at night and 
put the following inscription
on the reverse side of a
bailiff's tombstone

Adam Laughead here does lie
His soul is not embalmed, nor his soul on high,
For such a wretch no devil would endure
May kites, crows and all birds
that rove and live on Crudden blood
Rise up his body & on his carcass feed 
Poison all his breed - Amen
-
Theres many a dashn' girl makes
a poor draggle tailed woman
