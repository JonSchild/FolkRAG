The Signing Up, of a One leg man.
   One day a man went to sign up
for the Army.  he had but one
leg.  He then ask the head man
what was he doing to do in the army
with only one leg.  The man told
him there was a lot for him to do.
So he said to the one legged man
(see that man over there pumping
that water in a pail, he said yes
I see him.  So what!  The head man
said  will you go over there and
tell him when the pail gets full,
you see he is blind.
