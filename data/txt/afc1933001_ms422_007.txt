THAT LOCAL O' MINE
(Tune—"Hi Ho the Merrio")

Ask me why I'm never blue,
Let me give the credit to
That Local o' mine—
Ask me, did it do the trick?
Look at me and see how slick.
Things are gonna be fine—

Chorus:
I wake up each morning
Singing merrily,
I'm for the Farmers Union
As long as it's for me!
Now I can laugh at trouble,
I'm as happy as can be,
I'm for the Farmers Union
As long as it's for me.

Just like a rooster I keep crowin',
We started and we've got to keep it goin'
So bring along your scalpers,
Bring 'em C. O. D.,
I'm for the Farmers Union
As long as it's for me.

Ask me if I like the chow,
If I think it is a wow —
Up and eager for to go,
That's a very good sign—
That Local o' mine—
Do I love it, I'll say so.

Chorus:
I could live on screenings
Or even tanbark tea,
I'm for the Farmers Union
As long as it's for me.
I could fight a bull or bear
Or Sampson on a spree,
I'm for the Farmers Union
As long as it's for me.

And now I'll eat my neighbor's biscuits
And tell him truly they're real delicious,
Let him bring his neighbor
And his family,
For I'm for the Farmers Union
As long as it's for me.    —Carl Nelson.

FARMERS UNION SONG
Tune—"The Battle Cry of Freedom"
By Mrs. Jos. E. Eckert, Garrison, N. Dak.

Yes, we'll rally to the Cause, boys, we'll rally once again,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!
We'll rally from the prairie; we'll rally from the plain,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!

Chorus:
The Union forever! We'll control the supply,
Create selling power, the middleman defy;
If we rally to the Cause, boys, rally once again,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!

We will welcome to our members the loyal, true, and brave,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!
And although we may be poor, not a man shall be a slave,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!

Let's all answer to the call, from the East and from the West,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!
And we'll prove a loyal crew, for the Cause we'll do our best,
Shouting "Co-operative Marketing"!

AMERICA

My country, 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the Pilgrims' pride,
From every mountainside
Let Freedom ring.

My native country thee
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love;
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.

Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees,
Sweet Freedom's song;
Let mortal tongues awake,
Let all that breathe partake,
Let rocks their silence break,
The sound prolong.

Our father's God, to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing;
Long may our land be bright,
With Freedom's holy light,
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God our King.

ORGANIZE, OH, ORGANIZE
(Tune: Maryland, Oh, Maryland)
By Andrew J. Fedje, Milnor, N. Dak.

I.

Ye farmers of this mighty land,
Organize, oh, organize!
It is bulwark ever more to stand,
Organize, oh, organize!
For with the flag of right unfurled
In spite of darts against you hurled,
You still must feed this hungry world,
Organize, oh, organize!

II.
If you would come into your own,
Organize, oh, organize!
Or be forever overthrown,
Organize, oh, organize!
Yes, everywhere, thruout this land,
The tillers of the land must stand
And be a farm united band,
Organize, oh, organize!

III.
Firmly to stand against each wrong,
Organize, oh, organize!
Your only hope is Union strong,
Organize, oh, organize!
To break the bonds of slavery,
That bind you now from sea to sea,
And from oppression to be free,
Organize, oh, organize!
