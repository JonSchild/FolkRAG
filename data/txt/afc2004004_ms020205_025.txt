Reverend Roe- Reel 1 - P. 4

seventeen years old and I'm now seventy-seven, the 18th, years old now and I
haven't taken a dram since.
[*A moral boy*]
I never gambled in my life. In fact, I've been very careful in my life.
I've never been a rogue, never stole, anything, and I think the reason why --
when I was just a boy, I don't remember how old -- I remember my sister, we
thought a deal of each other, and we were seeking religion. Of course, we
[*Seeking religion*]
hadn't been enlightened. The only thing we knowed was to go and pray and trust
in the Lord. And I remember we went together one night out in the pine thicket
out at the edge of the old orchard and that night, it was just about just dark
I went a little further out in the thicket than she. And I was praying that
night. There was something, I don't know, mysterious, seemed to happen to me
that sort of changed my whole life, and from that time on I never could partake
of those things. You see, there'd been something that kept me, however
I didn't join the church at that time, but I always religiously inclined
and I attended Sunday school and church. And one of the reasons I didn't
join the church was because there were so many different denominations and
they was preaching different doctrines, I didn't know who was right.
[*First year of work for himself*]
I set out to find out; I began to read my Bible. And when I was twenty-one
years old my father didn't give me anything--he just told me I was grown and
I could go for myself. I went to work for a Mr. Lee there. I worked for him
for twenty-five dollars a month and I lost one day that year - the 4th of July.
My father asked me to let him use my money, and at the end of the year he
would pay me. But that year I bought one of those navy blue suits; they
cost ten dollars at that time, and they didn't wear out. And when I had
finished the year and went home, my father told me, says "I've sold all the
cotton but one bail. So you take that cotton to town and sell it and you
pay Mr. Glass a little debt I owe him, and the balance is yours." And when
I had paid the debt, I had $17.50. And I had &17.50 and a navy blue suit for
my year's work.
