BJ TAPE 20, p. 30

"They ain't no God."  It's sumpthin' in they min' tell 'em it's
a God.  But they got that 'bellious mind outside, that, "I ain'
gonna do it;; I'm gonna say no."  That's Satan; that's the father,
this, ah, that's they father.  'Cause Jesus say, "You jest like
 your father."  
         But yet an' still, some folks say, "God is everybody's father."
But that's just as big a lie as ever was told.  Gid ain't
everybody's father.  If He was, they, they'd serve 'im.  Ya see.
The Lord told some of his, the mens, when they was talkin' to,
about diffrunt things.  He said, "You just like your father."  'Cause
they didn't believe.  Said, "If you don't believe me, you's just
like your father.  'Cause my Father ain't your father."  You see
what I mean?  Said, I'm like my Father, you're like yours."
Said, "The one you serve is yours;  that's all to that."
