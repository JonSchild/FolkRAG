Reverend Roe. Reel 2. P.3
to go out by my pastor and carry on a rival until he could come.  I went in there on Sunday, you know, and there was Monday and Tuesday and he came Wednesday.  Well, the feeling that came over me when I was in that light, it came back to me, and, you know, I wasn't no preacher then, but the people just couldn't stand me hardly.  We had to haul them home.
What happened to them, what did they do?
I don't know; they just shouted and calling out, and it went on that way each night until the pastor come.  Well he was really a good preacher, and when he come and started, the muting just died.

A: You don't remember afterwards just what you've been doing or saying as the Holy Spirit is coming down that way.
R: I don't remember it; no, sir, I don't.  And often I go to my pulipit and really don't know what I'm gonna say.  And I just take my text and I start to talking, and just seems things go to coming to me.  And another thing, I just don't feel, you know, that I'm gonna be able to preach a sermon xxxx worthwhile.  In fact, I just always have that
