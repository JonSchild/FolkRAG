I passed a very old convict driving a herd of milch cows
home and stopped to chat with him.

"My trigger got loose, Boss", he answered when I
asked why he wore stripes.  "I shot dat man nearly half in two,
but I didn't go to do it.  De gun jes' went off; my trigger
got loose".  His lips trembled and his eyes begged me earnestly
to believe him.  Not many I met failed to protest their innocence
or ask my help to free them.  "I was shootin' craps with a nigger, Boss,
and I made my pint and he wouldn't
recognize it," said another in explaining
his trouble

The Negro spirituals are well known, though trained
negro musicians are fast robbing them of their strange primitive
beauty.  I wished records of those [hereto] hitherto unrecorded, but I wanted
most to hear gangs of negro convicts sing their work songs
and give their field, railroad, steamboat, and levee camp
"hollers".  But most people [, to them, these songs are] regard[ed] these
songs as trivial and valueless.  Not I.  Some day, in my judgment,
[standards works] examples of American music will be written around such melodies
[songs] as "Po Laz[r]'us", "Big Leg Rosy", "Dem Long Hot Summer Days",
"Stewball", "[Mister] Shorty George", and other work tunes.  Intermingled
with these will come the "hollers" which [mark work] mark rhythm [with] of a
slower movement than the ax-cutting and hoeing songs for which
the rhythm in "Rosy" and "Stewball" make ideal time.  In contrast
to Louisiana, where gangs are forbidden to sing while at work,
Captain Mayfield and other managers at [Ranchman] Parchman, Mississippi,
told me that they got at least a third more labor out of singing
