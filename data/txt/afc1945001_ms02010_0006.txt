The other types of rumors--"anxiety rumors," "escape rumors," "super-
natural rumors," and "curiosity rumors"--appear to grow out of the public
tensions which exist during wartime; they spread because of the virtual im-
possibility of completely eliminating such tensions through information.
Adequate and accurate information about the war--plus the confidence among the
American people that they are receiving adequate and accurate information about
the ware--will tend to allay these tensions, and thus to reduce the volume of
rumors. But it is clear that as long as war continues to produce a succession
of situations about which there is bound to be apprehension and anxiety, even
the most complete information will not be able to destroy rumors entirely.

The Community Rumor-Control Project

News is ordinarily thought of as a report of day-to-day happenings. In
the course of such a process, interest often runs ahead of the facts available,
and rumors fill in the places where information is incomplete. Rumor study will
reveal where the need for [*more*] information lies, and the rumor-control project can then
take the necessary steps to satisfy the information needs of the community.

The rumor-control project can be of greatest service if it regards itself
primarily as an information agency in the community, taking the responsibility
for detecting and meeting faps in information. The project can profit greatly
through the cooperation of local newspapers, radio, civic groups, librarians,
welfare agencies, and other established information centers. Materials to supply
the information needed to cover local rumors can be found locally.

If the rumor-control project wishes to concern itself with non-local rumors,
it can summarize such rumors and report them to the Office of War Information,
