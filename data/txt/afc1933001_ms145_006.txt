Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Alan:

I just received a letter from Miss Flanders suggesting
that your trip to New England be postponed until September.
This should make everything more convenient for you this
summer.
I am always so ready to criticize that I feel that I
cannot - must not delay in complimenting you on your excellent
piece of work.  We sat up last night until well past midnight
listening to the Lead Belly records.  To say that we enjoyed
them would be putting it mildly indeed.  The Bourgoise Blues
is the finest song that I have heard in years.  Your fears
regarding this song are unfounded.  We Americans have a good
sense of humor and can take it.  Carolyn said that she 
always wanted a good description of this town and has at
last found it in Lead Belly's song.  My only regret is that
you included the last stanza of the Fannin Street song.  This
may even hinder the sale of records, and I believe that it
might be well to substitute another stanza for it in the
future editions of the album.  All in all though, it is the
most successful piece of work that you have yet done.  I feel
sure that we shall be responsible for the sale of many albums. 
Please send me the names and addresses of the executives of the
phonograph companies which we spoke of on Tuesday.

With kindest regards,
Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
