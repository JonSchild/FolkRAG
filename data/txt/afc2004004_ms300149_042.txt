Work and practice on them. Also have quite a few
love songs, rail road songs-such as the wreck of . No 9.
which is according to legand the train which colided
with Al. Bowin. have fun having my old Balods
typed. and have colected about 50 since I saw you
I mean to do quite a bit of work on this this winter
and see some old people I know- "in the hills"
I want the words to some realy old ones I used
to hear as a child very badly. But run little trips for
me are expensive and same time not possible
as I have no car so must hire some one to take me
or go by bus or train. And the places I want to go
many times there are no trains or buses - and if 
I don't stop this scribble you will, if you read
it at all, got no work done this fall.
so thanks again for everything-and give your
wife my best wishes
Sincerly your friend
Al Meda Riddle
