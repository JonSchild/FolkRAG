Dear Mr. Spivacke:
The necessity of wiring you for more records to be hurried
to Raiford, Fla., was a surprise also to me. I was sorry to
disturb the even flow of affairs for you in true Lomaxian style.
But this section is rich in fresh material which I can't resist.
I used more stuff than I had counted on.
This afternoon we move on to Florida. From there to
Clemson, S.C., to record some white spiritual singing said to be
quite unusual. Then on to Murrell's Inlet, S.C. and on to
Washington. In case you are to be around I plan to look in on
you about June 15" or 20".
I have spent some money on tips to Negroes and whites who
gave me there work time (this is the busiest crop season). By
staying around longer I might probably have got the same material
without cash, but I chose the more direct route, which, I hope,
will meet with your approval.
Thank you for your kind notes.
Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
