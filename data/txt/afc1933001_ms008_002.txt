FIVE LECTURE-RECITALS

The American Ballad

BY JOHN A. LOMAX

Address: University of Texas Station,
Austin, Texas

Author of "Cowboy Songs" and "Songs of the Cattle Trail"; for three
years Sheldon Fellow for the Investigation of American Ballads; twice
President of the American Folklore Society; one of the organizers
and the first Secretary of the Texas Folklore Society.

1. The Songs of the Cowboy
2. Negro "Spirituals"
3. Songs of the "Worl'ly" Negro
4. Cowboy Verse
5. Types of the American Ballad

THESE LECTURES are popularized abridgements of papers read before the
Modern Language Association of America. Much of the material used
has never appeared in print, and Mr. Lomax endeavors to interpret the
spirit of the Folk-Songs by sympathetic recital and singing rather than by
a conventional lecture. Audiences throughout the United States have been
surprised to discover that much genuine poetry has remained buried and
unnoticed in these rough ballads of our own people. In the hope that
these changing songs may all be recorded before they disappear, wherever
he goes, Mr. Lomax seeks conferences with those who know Folk-Songs.
These lectures are offered singly or in series.
