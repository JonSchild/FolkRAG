Kansas City, Missouri, August 8 ---- Looks like
our war planes are not proving so superior in combat to
enemy planes as we boasted they were. The war communiques
say our planes are so much better than the others, but I
notice that our pilots who have been up against enemy planes
say the Jap Zeros are mighty good planes. There is no
use kidding ourselves about how good we are or how good
our war equipment. We better keep on hustling to make
it better and get plenty of it where it is needed. [*(11)*]
