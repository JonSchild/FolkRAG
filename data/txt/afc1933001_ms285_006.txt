D.M.5
[?]) The minstrel songs current are
"You shall be free"
"The Preacher & the Bear"
"Noah & the Ark"
If you want to go to heaven, I'll tell you how to do it,
Just grease your feet in mutton suet,
Go to the gate & take your stand
And ooze right over in the promised land ---
---
Chicken stealin' -- watermelon eating, -- 
running -- etc..
Preacher's hat --
Why??
Desire to satirize racie?
religion?
Acceptance of white man's role, judgement
of race?
Secular song in church, school?
Why?
