After the new needles are in use
and the new mike I am sure that
you will start making good records.
The needles are enclosed in this letter.
I believe that you will need more
discs in metal and celluloid - we carry
stocks of both and can give you
instant shipment.

I expect to be in St Louis after July
25th until Aug 15 and if you work
North I should like to put in a
day or two with you.

The wiring diagram will be ready
to send you early next week - please
give me an address unless the
present one is sufficient.

Sincerely
W.C. Garwick
