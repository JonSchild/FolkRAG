Mr. Spivacke has 
written about the machine 
and I intend to get some 
Mexican corridas about 
U. S. [exparences?] before I
leave here. Have you any 
leads I could follow 
in Louisiana
Be sure to give the 
Strunk book to Mrs. Seeger.
Also I am sending her batches 
of songs, beginning today.
Yet I marvel at the 
financial terms you seem to 
have put over.  Good luck
always.  Affectionately, 
Father
