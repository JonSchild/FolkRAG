"The way those Japs are digging in up in the Aleutians, it
wouldn't surprise me to see Seattle and some of those west coast towns catch
it any day now. Our ships can't go in and get them because we never charted
the waters up around there, and I don't think we've got enough ships to blast
them out anyway. Our airplanes will have to do that little job, but they're
always complaining about the bad weather. The Japs got in there in bad
weather, why can't we get them out?" [*Salt Lake City 8-6 21*]
