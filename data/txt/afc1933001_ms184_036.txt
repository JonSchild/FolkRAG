camps or in the field of civil life, send them on to me with full justification 
and I shall be very glad to make the proper recommendations and get the
funds. The important thing is to connect each project with a general war
project and justify it on that basis. The suggestions you made for USO were
excellent and I sent them to Mr. Heininger. He is on his way to California
but I expect to hear from him soon. If you can send a similar program for recording 
within the Army, let me have it, and I am sure that eventually it will
produce results.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S. Now that I have word regarding our project I shall investigate the possibility 
of your going to Latin America.
