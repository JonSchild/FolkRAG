and she had to stay out there a week. Mama June said that she
was near agone; that she would try to raise her. So she kep
her out there at her house a week and doctored on her. Which 
the old girl did get bette.r She bathed her up, boiled up 
a lotta roots up thera and bathed her and greased her around 
eith different salves and one stuff and nuther, give her 
a lot of stuff make her vomick a lot, say she vomick up a lot 
of stuff look like old black hair nets what folks wear over 
their hair, said they was little snakes, the folks say. I don't 
know what they was, Didn't see that. But she got better, but she 
still aint no 'count. She's not able to do anything for herself. 
She just sumpin sittin up there on the porch. Look like a 
skelipin yet. She's just got Tb that's all ail her, I believe.
A: You don't believe in that sort of stuff?
V: I certainly don't. I don't believe in it at all. They won't
get na'y dime of mines, talk bout fixin nothins. I don't
want it fixed . Let it stay like it is. If I should get hurt
or something-- course I'm not gonna bother anybody--and so it
don't have any need to bother me -- so if you do and I can't
take a stick or knife or something and make you behave I ain't 
gon' do nothin else to you. Cause I'd heap rather just beat a person
nearly to death rather than to hurt him like that. If he hurt
me bad enough I8d rather hit him than to poison him or take
his life.
A: Honey, do the folks down there know the different poisons that
they can give you? That aren't known to medical doctors?
V: They does do it roun there , so they say. (265)
