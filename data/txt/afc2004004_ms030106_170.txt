1680 B (Con't.)

Said, "If you don't give me my money, off [comes] goes your 
head," and he pointed a great big pistol at me. And Harry
said, "Don't hurt this boy, he don't know what he's doing.
He's only a young brother of mine and I'll [offer] assure you--that I'll
give all your money back that you lost on this deal." So
when they started to claiming money, why the one maybe had
lost maybe three dollars on the deal, he'd say ten and everyone
would have their money much more than what it was. I had quite
a bit of money in my pocket.[--had] It taken all the money I had in
my pocket and all I had won and [probably] practically all Harry had won and
so forth and so on like that. So he kept me out of the game,
which it was only a kind of a short time before Harry would
have all the money, if I would let Harry alone.

Then, of course, there was then a certain suspicion on
Harry, because I tried to cheat[,]. So Harry said, "You stay out
of the game." Said, "Let me play these boys and maybe I may
be luckier than you" and he sang a song like this as [they were] he 
would turn--flip the cards over:-

I'm going to get one and go toreckly [directly],
(Pop, one would hit.)

I'm gonna get one and go directly,
(Card would hit.)

Oh, my baby is down and out. [Card hits]
I'm gonna get one and go directly,
(Two dollars more--catch it there, boy.)

Oh, I'll get one and go directly,
