Gentlemen:

Replying to your circular letter in regard to songs or ballads used at this Institution or made up by boys, I would state that no such songs as you speak are written or sung by the boys here. The songs which we use are hymns and patriotic songs which are available to everyone.

Very truly yours,
A C Dorr.
President.
