ROLL ON,BABE

    In Eastern Kentucky, this song is said to have been made up when the 
L&N railroad was [brought]pushed through the mountains, and local opinion is divided
as to whether the "composin" was done by whites, Negroes, or both.  Mention
of John Henry in many version and its close textual and melodic connection
with other Negro work songs, however, indicates its probable Negro origin,
although it has now become a standard part of the [reptories] repertory of Southern
banjo pickers and is sung, so far as we know, exclusively by them.

    The following stanzas that occur in other versions indicate its
work song origin more clearly than does the banjo version printed here in full.

"I looked at the sun and sun looked red,
I looked at my partner and he was almost dead.

This old hammer killed John Henry,
But it can't kill me, buddy, it can't kill me."
