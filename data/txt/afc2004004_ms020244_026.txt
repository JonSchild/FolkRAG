Reel of 9/26/61, Side 1, Song 10

SUNSHINE 'N' RAIN
A schoolteachers' song of instruction

CHORUS:
Sunshine 'n' rain,
We notice divided rain
The lighted face of love
With showers from above.
Sunshine 'n' rain,
We notice the glory in rain,
The subject is the sunshine 'n' the rain.

Would you care to see upon the fairest ground,
It helped to gather flowers, fruit 'n' grain.
(Fruit 'n' grain)
(CHORUS)
