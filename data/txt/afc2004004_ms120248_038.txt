Back in the main room again the drums were beginning to pull
the loi into to hearts of the worshippers. A tall young
woman in white with a red head rag and a loose and silly face
was Simbi. A possessed person (generally) begins by staggering
about the room on one leg, almost but never quite falling into
the arms of the spectators. The motion is that of a person walking
along the iron of a railroad track. Then a violent and frenzied
dance begin, the hips and shoulders shaking, wiggling, shivering,
vibrating in a fashion impossible for a person in a normal physical
state. Later Gran Erzulie enters into the body of a young girl
who had seemed before to be made out of sections of willow branches;
a completely soft young adolescent face over a body so pliant and
fine that it could not stand straight but let every bone take its
own seperate angle, the whole body akimbo. Now this pliant body
grew suddenly old, the legs were bent and bowed inward with rheumatism
and the belly was sucked up with pain and fatigue under the withered
breasts. A continual low murmur of groans and whines came from
the twisted lips as the others dancers jostled her. Then Ciceron,
whom I believe carries all the loi in the thin old hunched shoulders
that make the mama drum growl and roar, called to the loi to dance,
and Simbi and Gran Erzulie seemed to be shaking themselves to pieces
the first in his male and the second in her old female fashion. This
dance went on growing more and more violent until the mamaloi called
for a mazon, which is the siganl for the departure of spirits. At
the end of this dance, both Simbi and Gran Erzulie swooned 
seperately on the floor in each others' arms, those two young bodies
curved against one another in a sort of trance of exhaustion. All
this time, of course, there had been other loi in the women present,
but the loi themselves, the inspired women, had given place
way and precedence to the two I have described. Presently as the
singing recommenced the body that had held Simbi dragged
itself off into a corner and went to sleep with its head in its
arms. The habitation of Gran Erzulie, however, only leaned against
the wall for a few moments and soon was back in the dance again.

One of the worshippers was a woman I judged to be about thrity-
five years old, a person with a firm positive mouth, agression
in every word (even though the voice was the shyest imaginable and
the head was hung in timidity), and a loose cotton dress with
a red plaid pattern. I mention the dress particularly because
it seemed to me as I watched that dress flutter with the body under
it writhing and wiggling like a snakes and the dress giving
hints of the passionate intensity of the body's movements, that the
dress and the woman were on fire and that I was watching a great
tongue of flame dancing about the hounfort floor. This woman, too,
was possiessed of Simbi, and with a vengance. Her whole personality
changed or intensified. Her voice became hoarse and raucous. Her
stride about the room was a drunken, pugnacious swagger. She would
attck various woman like a dog in rut, and the movement of her hips
in the twist and jerk that is peculiarly the male motion in the sex
act would at times become so rapid that her butt was a sort of blur
of motion. Presently the little feminine creature in the lavender
dress became possessed again and presently was quivering on the
floor in the middle of the room in a perfect spasm of shimmying.
On her knees, her head nearly touching the floor behind her. And
all this time there were others, Anita, ma belle chanteure among them.
