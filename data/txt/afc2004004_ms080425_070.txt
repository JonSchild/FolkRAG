MR: What we like about it, it's got a lot of expression in it, it comes
from the Bible. On the top of the song, it gives you the scripture
from which the man was inspired to write the song, so it's just
a good way to worship.

MRS: (in background) ...and the people we love...

MR: We have... the fellowship is just out of this world, the Sacred
Harp singers, they're very devoted people, and they greet each other
real friendly.  Wherever you meet one: if he's on the Sand Mountain, 
if he's in Florida, if he's in Washington D.C., or New York or
Vermont, it was the same type of feeling, wherever.

AL: Where does that feeling come from, you think?

MR: Well, I think, it has a lot of emotion, 'cause you can feel the 
spirit as it's being sung, and I think as you sing the words, you
feel the spirit of what the meaning of it is, as you're singing it.
I think that's the reason that Sacred Harp singing is so popular
among the people that sing it. I never knew a group of people
anywhere who are as closely knit as the Sacred Harp singers are.

AL: Does your family have its root here in Ephasis (?), you been
here in this country a long time?

MR: Yes sir, I think my father moved here in Eighteen and eight-nine.

AL: Was that new country back then?

MR: Well, much newer than it is now! Our part of the County, Heard County,
and...the lower part of the county was settled before the upper part
was...so it was back at that time, around the turn of the century
that this part started developing.

AL: And what's your profession, are you a farmer?

MR: I run a (lumber??) business.

AL: You're mayor too, aren't you? How long have you been mayor?
