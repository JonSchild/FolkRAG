Mr. Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge

The Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I may go to Washington next [Monday] week but I would like to
be sure to meet you there because there is some information that
I should be glad to get from you. Please answer quickly so that
I have time to make arrangements for my board.

Also, if not convenient to you do let me know as I may
delay my trip to the following week. I intend to spend from four
to seven days in Washington and will buy some of your Haitian recordings.

Sincerely,
S. Comhaire
