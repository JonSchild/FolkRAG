Confidential

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

I'm addressing you with considerable trepidation of spirit because it is 
impossible for me to be sure whether I've done the A of A F-S a good turn
or a bad one with the enclosed memorandum - which please read with charity
as I had only 2 days in which to prepare it. (I had also to struggle
with a stupid stenographer whose work was so bad I had to have most of it done
over; but that is a minor difficulty compared with my other troubles!)

Unless I explain in some detail how come, you'll never in the world understand
how all this came about; and indeed, just why it happened I probably
never will understand.

My RA job terminates this week some time so far as I know, though I was told
the revocation of my termination was to be requested. Never having heard
anything further about this. I supposed myself relieved of my promise to return 
to Washington on request, and began casting about in my mind for some
means of continuing f-s- collecting. I still have the lumberjacks very much
at heart; and Henry Cowell gave me some names in California that he had been
nursing along and told me to get his recording apparatus from Gerald Strang
in Los Angeles; but I can't afford to buy blank records nor to travel about
as I would like even here. So I bethought me of Guggenheim and drifted into
the Registrar's Office at Stanford University to inquire the date for application.
This turned out to be Oct. 15th, so I was too late for this year.
The Registrar suggested I try the foundations; but he couldn't find his
file which contained an outline of the scope of each foundation's interest,
and suggested I go into the President's office and ask Miss True, his secretary.
She inquired why I wanted to know and I told her, and she said she
thought I ought to see Dr. Wilbur, for he is on the board of the Rockefeller
Foundation and would know to whom I should apply.

Now talking to Ray Lyman Wilbur is not my idea of an amusing or even pleasant
way of spending 15 minutes. This is probably because the last time it happened
to me, was 12 or 14 years ago, and I [went] had gone in to thank him for the University's
efforts to clear up a charge of forging a check which was brought against me by
a neurotic woman, and to assure him I had had nothing to do with it. He sat
staring at me blankly and unresponsively for 5 minutes, and I got up and went out
with the idea that he had probably gathered from my embarrassment an impression
