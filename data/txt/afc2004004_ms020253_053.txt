(PURGING - CHURCH)
tha's what I was first on my fast for, an' in the
beginnin', an' mos' things come inbetween, jus' like she come
between there an burden me.
     So we, I an' her sit together, that night, in the Church,
an' we had a glorious meetin' -- that was on Saturday night.
Baptizin' tomorrow mornin' -- An', ah, the power of God rolled on
me when the meetin' begin to start, an' the seekin' start.  They
had a lot of seekers.  An' the seekers, some seekers, ya know,
already had the Holy Ghost; they like myse'f, jus' seekin' for
mo' power.  An' so, an', you know, some seekin' for the Holy
Ghost, ya know, too.  An' so, we all was, they all was down on
their knees, all around the place -- great big church -- an' ah,
so somethin' that the, the Lawd fell upon her right there.  An'
I was jus' seekin', ya know, jus' down on my knees seekin', but
I had it in my mind, "Lawd, will you hear me?  Lawd, will you
hear me."
     An' all at once, I looked around there, an' I don't know
when Sister Ollie lef' me, you know, seekin', you know, she
was seekin', jus' crawled off on her knees.  I was seekin'.
An' that woman was beginnin' to seek, ya' hear me?  She jus' seeked that
night genuine (gen'lemen - generally?).  Yeah, she never seeked
before an' she couldn't stop!  You see, it fell on 'er.  God
fell on 'er.  He made her known what happened.  She's a gre-at
big woman; she weigh 'way over two hundred.  An' she was solid walk,
clear to the back of the church on her natchul fanny.  An' come
back.  Oww, that was a miser'bl thing to see movin'!  Jus'
movin'; the Lawd jus' movin' her.  An' when she come back,
when she got back up to the open place, you know, in the church,
then ended the seek, boy, she purged.  She. . .
