Gentlemen:-
September $2.70.

We extended you our usual thirty day terms 
on the above account but as payment has not been received 
we believe an oversight has occurred on your part.

Will you kindly check your records and submit 
payment promptly to correspond with the amount 
shown.

Very truly yours,

WESTON ELECTRICAL INSTRUMENT CORP.
