Inter-Office Memorandum
OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION
Public Inquiries Bureau
DATE: August 8, 1942
TO: Miss Katherine C. Blackburn
Chief, Public Inquiries Bureau
FROM: Richard C. Wilson
Field Representative - Wisconsin
SUBJECT: Bureau of Intelligence Report No. 6: RUMORS
This report is based upon rumors which we have had told to us, rumors that
we have overheard but told to other people, and rumors brought to our attention
by people whom we had on the look-out for them.
The people of Milwaukee are talking about the war, production of materials,
labor, wastes and inefficiencies in government and other problems and situations
that they have heard about. There don't seem to be very many vicious
rumors rampant in this city. Most of the rumors we have picked up are of the
"see how much I know" variety. The purpose of these rumors is to impress upon
other people the vast fund of information that individuals have.
We have grouped these rumors more or less on a subject basis to give you a
rather complete picture of comments we have heard on several different topics.
