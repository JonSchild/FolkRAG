Dear Father,

[*1.*]
A small note of inquiry only - a cousin of Ben Robinson's Robertson
called me yesterday to ask whether you had received the book
of old songs by Elija Owens which Ben has already sent you.
Ben has not received notification that this book has come,
and would like to know about it. If you have not received
it write him and let me know, too, so that I can run it down
here either at Hyatsville or at the Library address.

Not much news from me except that I am very busy. I
will be in New York Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for the
International Congress of Musicologists.

These appearances are on the cuff; the Library pays my
way.

Write me. With much love to you both
Alan Lomax

Mr. Robertson did not send this book
to me, but Dr. Harold Spivacke.
Miss Rogers showed it to me. I did not
take it away.
I hated to say good-bye to Bess yesterday,
though she seemed happy and
greatly improved physically. Why no letters?
