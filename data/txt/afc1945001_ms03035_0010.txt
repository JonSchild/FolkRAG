"This is war, and war is death. We have been too mushy in
this country."
There also is considerable worry over the course of the war,
and a business man said to me the other day we might have to ask Britain
for permission to copy and use its "too little and too late."
Davis' "We can lose this war" was something this area needed --
and probably the country needed it, too. I am still concerned, however,
with the apparent inability of anybody to still the internal discordant
voice and curbstone generals. If we lose this war, we'll beat ourselves
by our own blindness. We don't seem a union at all at times but a nation
of bellyachers, even with death staring us in the face.
