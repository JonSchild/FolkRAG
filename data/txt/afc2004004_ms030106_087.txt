This one is a real favorite in the city of New Orleans.

Question: About when?

Morton: About in the year 1906, 1907.

They call her Frivolous Sal,
A peculiar sort of a gal,
With a heart that was mellow,
An all 'round good fellow,
Is my old pal.

Our troubles, worries and cares,
She's always willing to share,
A wild sort of devil,
But dead on the level,
Was my gal Sal.

This was my transformation when I first transformed in the business. Of course, I used to transform them all the same way.

They call her just Frivolous Sal,
Yes, that peculiar sort of a gal,
Her heart that was mellow,
All around good little fellow,
She's my old pal.

Yes, all our troubles, worries and cares,
She is always willing to share,
Wild sort of little devil,
Just know, babe, she's on the level.
She's my, she's my gal Sal

Yes, know, babe, she's on the level,
She's my, my gal Sal.
