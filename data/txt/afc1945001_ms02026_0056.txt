            be done by news commentators by the broadcasting of 
            names which are obvious to Jewish, Polish, Italian as 
            incidents arise indicating the efforts played by the
            various groups. Specific comments upon the melting 
            pot character of our war effort should be continuously 
            made.
   3.      Stress can be laid as to what we shall lose and what 
            we shall gain in this war. Comments need to be made
            on specific situations and repeated. Comparisons should
            be made between totalitarian orders and democratic 
            processes. When suggestions are made over the radio, as 
            they are at present, that each citizen buy war bonds,
            save fats, collect scrap metals, etc., it should be 
            emphasized that the person is not only aiding the war 
            effort, but is specifically guaranteeing his own and 
            his children's future.

"Another very important anti-rumor method is the anticipation of the
development of the new demands upon the citizenry and supplying of information 
about these new demands. Thus, there is prospect of rationing of 
meat in the near future. It is extremely likely that many rumors will 
spring up about this subject, which will be malicious and discouraging.
A great deal can be done by commentators at the present moment by discussing 
all the facts involved and the reasons for such rationing. The
more understanding and specific information which the average citizen has 
the more automatically he will counteract rumors."
            Attached is a list of rumors that are currently making the rounds 
in Chicago.
