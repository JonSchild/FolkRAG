ta have ya own husband.  Ya got -- well, one whole man's enough
for any one whole woman.  I don't care where they goin'.  I don't 
care how it is.  If he's a man. An' if she's a woman.  
     But.  I was talkin' about if, if they are dirty, in that, that
way, they sh-should be particu'ly sure to tell. . .Jus' say you. . .had
a, a woman:  "Oh, I don' care what my ol' lady say.  She ain't --
she cain't whup me.  She ain't gonna do nothin' to me."  Well, what
the woman care?  She don't care either.  See?  She'll throw out
hints at him an', you know, crack at 'im an' do everything else.
Why?  Because you didn't care.  See?
     Tha's just the same way it is, is, is with a man.  Man'll say,
"Why, she don't care nothin' 'bout him; what [do] in the worl' I care about 'im?"
See?  "He can't whup me."  See?  An' there it go.  But if a woman or
anything makes, make a person respect them. . .

     You know?  Ah, ah, after my husband died?  Da, da, this George
Jones?  After he died, them chillun a mine, they nary one can tell ya
they ever seed a man's shoe off in my house. . .Never.  An' if I had
wanted somebody an' if I had anybody I, I had sense enough to do it --
"Now, you gonna recognize my chillun just like if they was a husban'."
An' I wasn't jokin'.  An' I still mean it, ya see?  "Ya can recognize
them two boys jest like if they was George Jones."  Because they never
seen nothin' a me an' they comin' up one day an' they will know me.
They never will say, "Mama, John, or Mr. Jack or Mr. Jim stayed all
night with you in, in our house."  Pardner, I mean, I feel good about
that!  They cain't say it.  Nary'n.  Today.  An' I feel good about it.
All.
     An' so that's what I meant about you can make, you can make
folks recognize you.  See?
AL:  It's not that you didn't have your men if you wanted to?
