A     (continued) 
Tommy, ah, used to be as much sought out for
his stories as - and his ah anecdotes as for
his fiddling.  Ah, Tommy could tell stories 
from morning till night.  He remembered all the
most wonderful and funny things that ever
happened to him, and he remembered who got
killed in all the feuds and the shooting
scrapes, and he remembered fights over whisky,
and he remembered all the funny things of the
frontier.

You know,America was made by anecdotes.  I one
time, ah, was in Washington, on a mission, and 
was being ah  [ONE]     by ah the Office
of War Information, and I said:  Well what are
- what's the present  - what's the - Schultz 
and what's ah, the - what are the big shots
really like?  He said:  Well you know, when they
come here to be filmed and we're making them
up, they spend their whole time telling jokes.
America was made on anecdotes.  [Lakin] [*he was*] was
the great anecdotalist and ah its been our
national pastime and, and ah, certainly Tommy
is a master of anecdote.
