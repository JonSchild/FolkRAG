Rumor


Statement was made today by a lady who recently had consulted 
a doctor that the doctor told her that, in his
opinion, at least 400 Jacksonville high school girls are
pregnant because of relations with men in the Army and
Navy services in this area.

She says the doctor expressed great concern over this
condition, not only from the moral angle but because of
the hospital congestion, shortage of doctors, and the
prospect of so many abortions.
