File 127
Dear Harold,
My plans (having the accidents & 
both good + bad fortune -
     Leave home Saturday or Sunday.
     Sunday in Ann Arbor with tolls.
[?]
     Monday - Detroit Negro supper
     Tuesday - road Washington
     Wednesday  "     "
That will require an extension of 
the time for this trip as follows: 
15th Oct. to 23rd Oct Off Bus.
24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 30th (?)
Oct - annual leave
Oct. 30th, or 31st thru Nov. 2nd or 3rd
Official business.
This means you should try to get me
an extra extension of time of 13 days - 
maximum estimate.
The only thing that will seriously alter 
these plans will news from [?]
or Kennedy which I do not expect.
I have [an annual leave] contacted
some most interesting people in 
the field of N. Orleans Jazz -
and have dismissed with Archia
