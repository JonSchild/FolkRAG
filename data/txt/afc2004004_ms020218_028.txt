[*meeting Cassius*}
AL: And you met this cousin of John Davis's?
BJ: Tha's right. Tha's right. An' tha's on'y -- an' 
that was the on'y -- ya see? That was all, to that. An'
AL: You mean you just went with him one time?
BJ: Oh, no. I mean he was the only boy I had -- I was 
connected with. I was often with him, but I never...
AL: How did you go out with him? To frolics, or what?
BJ: Uh-uh. To church. Jus' go to churches, an' the candy 
pullin', an' like that. An' egg crackin' an' apple dippin' -- 
parties, they call it, ya know.
AL: I see.
BJ: But Mama had frolics, y'know -- I call 'em frolics.
 Mama...
AL: [She] Your mama didn't mind your having this young man?
BJ: No, she liketed him all at once. [She] Jus' liketed him. An' 
he asked for [more] my comp'ny, you see? An' he took care of me, 
along where I went, ya know. I mean, he didn't let me git in no bad places 
[person]-- an' he was a stranger, too, ya see? An' he liked 
the church. He still liked it...
[*courting*]
AL: But you could go places with him?
BJ: There wasn't no places to go but from there to church.
AL: No, but I mean your mother would let you go.
BJ: Yeah, an' then Mama would go, too, an' trust me home 
with him. You see, he would come an' see me. That's the main 
time I had with him. Mostly, ya see?
AL: What?
BJ: Mama would go to Fitzgerald and to see, my mama was young, 
ya know? -- an' she would go to to Fitzgerald and to other places, no doubt. See, 
I never know [nothin'[ anythin' about her life, ya know. Well, what she [thought] done, 
she done oot yonder.        That done her good to have some-
body there with me, that she could trust, ya see. I would be 
home an' Cassius go fishin', you know, he around all day long an' 
sometimes first part of the night. All like that, be home. 
Walkin', [all like that], moonlight; go up to him and them house; 
[they would play with them (?)] an' diferent places like that [way,] you know. An' that 
type. You see, Mama was gone. She went an' never know nothin' 
about that. An' so I [just] guess that was a good way for that, ya
