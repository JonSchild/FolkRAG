Boy  White 
Grade 12 

A friend of mine was stationed at 
Keesler Field Mo. waiting to be transfered 
to a school where he would receive his basic 
training for the Army Air Corps.  He expected 
to be transported to the new location any 
day and expectancy hovered over the whole 
division.  

Finally they received word that 
they would move and were moved the same 
day to a girl's school in Freeport, Mo.  
The first letter I received after he arrived 
there said that the school was very fine 
and he had only one kick coming.  They had 
taken the girls away before they got there!!
