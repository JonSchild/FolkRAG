A Letter from Bataan

Today at the shows they are having
little short stories that tell us about
"the boys over there". The last one I 
saw was "A letter from Bataan". It
showed us the boys in action and 
reminded many people of their loved
ones. Two boys died or rather were
killed by an airplane which bombed
them. They couldn't see the jap plane
because of some sort of disease called 
night blindness. Night blindness
is caused by the lack of fresh vegetables.
The folks back home had been
hoarding canned vegetables, wasting gas, and tires,
hoarding copper, and hoarding other
metals which would have been of
use to our government. They received
a letter from their son telling then
not to waste things. This letter was
dated March 7. In about 10 minutes
they received a telegram telling that
the boys had died in action on March
6. Everyone should do all they can
