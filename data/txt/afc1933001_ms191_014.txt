HELEN CREIGHTON PROJECT EXTENSION

Miss Helen Creighton's original project for recording
war and wartime songs in Nova Scotia will expire at the end of
December. Since Miss Creighton is about to exhaust her allotment
of 150 blank disks and since she reports that she is
"only just beginning, especially with the Services," I recommend
that 75 additional recordings be acquired in accordance with
the following budget:

75 12-inch disks at 80Â¢                 $60.00
75 duplicates at $2                        150.00
Miscellaneous (shipping, etc.)      50.00
Laboratory Handling Charge         52.00
                                                        -------------
                                                         $312.00
Respectfully submitted,
