Mr. Huddie Ledbetter
604 E. 9th
New York City

Dear Huddie:

I am happier than I can say that your concert was so successful and that you have now got a regular job.  Don't fail to take it, and follow Nick's advice wherever possible.  Elizabeth is as happy about it as I am, and we both send our love to you and Martha.

Alan
