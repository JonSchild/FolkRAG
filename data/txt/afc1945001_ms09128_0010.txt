Sometimes as things get scarier
and the prices spiral upward, if we
folks in the Year of our Lord 1943

Have been Tom's food for seven long year.

You see a man can get along with-
out a wife, but unless he is a Gandhi
he can't live long without a ration book.
I feel in these days like La Fontaine,
who said: "The smallest grain of meal
would suit my necessities better than 
this pearl.

Hitler is so busy tending to the war 
in Russia that he can't make speeches
in Germany.
