Dear Alan:

I'd like to use in my Adventures the letter
you wrote to Mr. Putnam from 
the Kentucky mountains. Send
me a copy of that and I'll
let you off from any further
 contributions to this book,
so you can rid yourself of
that burden (if any) most
easily. I'm working some
every day, though mainly trying
 to rid myself of what
we used to say dogs had - mange. 
It's pretty terrible.

Lovingly,
Father

Mr. Putnam filed your letters, I [?].
