An' so, an', an', an' so one did, ah, one of 'em did die,
ya see? An' she thought it. An' she -- so she said, she said she
told it to the grave, she said, "Don't you hant [hand] me." Huh!
Ha, ha, ha, ha! An' said, "Don't you do it."
But, anyway, she said it -- Along a good while, before that
year was out, said she come to her in a dream an' tol' her, told 
her that she wasn't gonna hant her. Said... Because she really 
was scared of it. See, the woman knowed it. She musta knowed
it 'cause she said everytime she keep her light on all night an',
an' talk about it all the time to peoples. 'Cause they had made a
promise of that, they were gonna hant one another, the first to
die. An' she said this woman come to her in a dream or sumpin',
a vision or sumpin', said, "I'm not gonna hant you." Hum, hum!
Yeah, so that's... So that was just satisfaction.
AL: There's a story about a woman whose husband was a sea cap-
tain and was away off around the world somewhere in the ocean.
And one night she saw him come in the room and stand at the foot
of her bed, you know, in her half-dream asleep...
BJ: Um-hum. Half-slumber.
AL: And when she woke up in the morning, of course, she didn't
believe it. And she went and looked and right where he stood 
there was a piece of seaweed and a puddle of salt water. 
BJ: Um-hum.
AL: And her house was miles from the ocean.
BJ: Um-hum. Yeah, just because she didn't believe?
AL: Still she didn't believe it.
BJ: Um-hum.
AL: But a few days later the news came that her husband...
BJ: Was dead.
