You Gonna Miss Me...Muddy Waters..

If the river was whiskey, babe,
And I was a diving duck,
I would dive to the bottom, babe,
And never would come up...
A-hah, you gonna miss me, 
When I'm dead and gone,
Ah--, you know you gonna miss me, baby,
When I'm dead and gone.

You know, I been feelin, I been feelin, baby,
Blue, all day long,
I just been sittin here, thinkin,
Wonderin where you is gone--
A-hah, you gonna miss me, etc...

You know, I got sumthin to tell you, I got something to tell you,
A thing or two,
I just can't stand the low-down
Old way you do,
But, how you gonna miss me, etc.

Well, you know, Bye-bye, baby,
I got no more to say,
It's just like I been tellin you, gal,
You gonna need my help someday,
Ah-hay-, you gonna miss me,
When I'm dead and gone,
Ah, you know you gonna miss me, baby, 
When I'm dead and gone.
