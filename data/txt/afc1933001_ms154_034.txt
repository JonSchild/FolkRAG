Library of Congress, Music Division
Washington D.C.
My dear Mr. Lomax:
I have heard from Mrs. Knight that there is
a possibility that you may have to leave the group
meeting at which you are to speak on March 8. If this
is true it will necessitate some adjustment in the program
to enable you to speak first. If you can possibly do so
will you let me hear from you by telephone tomorrow so that
I may make these arrangements at our last committee meeting
which is to be held within the next few days.
We are delighted that you are to be with us and
are disappointed that you will be unable to sing at the
dinner. Our children in my three large buildings clamor for 
you over the radio and we have a terrible time letting hundreds
of kiddies hear over our three radios. The oldsters enjoy you
fully as much. I do wish that you could consider a later train
and stay over. At any rate, I do want to get in touch with you
soon and if by any chance you do not call me, or are unable to
get in touch with me I will give you a ring at the Library.
(Call National 6000- Hyde School)
Sincerely yours, 
Ruth K. Webb
