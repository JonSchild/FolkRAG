New Orleans, Louisiana

Dear Mrs. Stryker:

I must apologize for not having replied to your
letter earlier, but it came to me in Michigan where
I was doing folklore work for the Library and I postponed
an answer until my return to Washington.

Your daughter's program sounds most interesting,
and yet I am afraid I can suggest nothing further at
the moment than that she put herself under the direction
of a competent agent. As I understand it, this is the
practice of most singers and lecturers nowadays.

Perhaps you would like to send me your daughter's
New York address so that I can call on her the next time
I am in the city. I should be delighted to meet her.

With best wishes, I am

Sincerely yours,
