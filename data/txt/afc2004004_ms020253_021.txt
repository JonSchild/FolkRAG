[*HATS, MODERN*]

I said, "I cain't get it to fit me."  The lady said, "They don't
make 'em to fit no mo'; they jus' make 'em to wear."  Ha, ha, ha
ha!  Tha' was true, too.  I said, "Well, that is true, 'Cause
I haven't seen 'em fit nobody else.  I can't try to get one to 
fit me."  Jus' put it on your haid, tha's all.  Jus' make 'em
to wear; hat don't fit nobody.  Jus' put 'em on.  An' go ahead
on.  Ha, ha, ha!
TL:  That's cute.  Don't make 'em to fit, just to wear, huh?
BJ:  Tha's all.  She tol' me the truf.

TL:  You had big parties?
BJ:  Yeah, big parties.  You could crack 'em for churches or
crack 'em for yourself jus' to have a party.  Or crack 'em to
sell.  Ya see?
TL:  Yeah.  Is collecting part of the party?  Everybody goes
out and collects the oysters?
BJ:  No, you jus' have, someone is goin' have it.  Like you
goin' a [have] gi' an oyster crackin', you go get some[one]body to get
your oysters or you get 'em yourself.  Or either buy 'em, you 
know, like that.  But they be, supposed to be, fresh oysters.
