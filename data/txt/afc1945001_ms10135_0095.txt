College Freshman Negro
Female

(1) A boy playing war had captured
Hitler and Mussolini. He was
leaving them behind with no one
to guard them when one of his
friends asked him "Aren't you
going to watch them?" The little 
boy answered "No, they don't need
watching because they are too
busy watching each other."
