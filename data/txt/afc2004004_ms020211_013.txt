in slave days was called "gibble"
[sic]. which means "a little of this
and a little of that," and referred to
the leftovers and corn mush poured
in troughs for the slaves to eat.*
"Juba (gibble) this and juba that,"
sings Bessie, slapping her thighs in
a "patty-cake" rhythm. "Juba killed
the yellow cat.  You sift-a the meal
and gave me the husk.  .  .  
"Juba up and Juba down" meant
all the Negroes had to eat that Juba.
They made songs up to describe the
situation. Those songs didn't come
from Africa."
A few years ago, Bessie traveled
to Williamsburg to sing in a film of
slave days and saw the trough her
grandfather ate gibble from as a 
plantation slave.  "The mothers
would save the leftovers and cook
up mush, mix celery and onions
and corn to make it tasty and put it
in the trough."
This was the custom every
Saturday, explained Bessie.  "The
slaves would dance and sing and
maybe the masters would let them
cook a pig. Every Saturday they ate
out of the trough.  They'd tell the
children stories and sing songs. But
that's how they made up the songs
and passed them down. My grandfather
(he lived to be 105) told us to
look for that trough if we ever went
to Williamsburg."
The "Buzzard Lope," a dance
that is a possible forerunner of the 
"Funky Chicken," originated in
slave days, says Besssie. 
The buzzards would feed on the
"boneyard pile," where landowners
threw dead animals. Folklore has it
that one hungry buzzard accidentally
nibbled at a sleeping mule.
The buzzard got a swift kick and,
from that day buzzards have done

with reference to Juba.

the "Buzzard Lope" before meals;
they dance around the dead animal
and jump over it a few times before
chowing down.
"Throw Me Anywhere In That
Old Field" was another song that
came from the "boneyard pile,"
where slaves felt they could have
easily been buried.  Their burials
were hardly considered "proper,"
Bessie explained. "We would sing it,
but the white folks didn't know we
was singing it to them."
Bessie, who sports four silver
rings and a jangle of silver and copper
bracelets, has co-authored a
book with Bess Lomax Hawes,
"Step It Down."  It chronicles the
games, plays, songs and stories
from her heritage. However, some
songs are lost, says Bessie, when a 
Sea Island Singer dies.  "Others just
don't know how to sing it," says Bessie.
"I can sing most of 'em. Songs
just seem to stay with me."
When she sings, usually alone
and at times with two to seven other
singers, she has no program. "I just
look at the congregation and I can
tell what they need. I know what to
sing.
"If children are there, you tell
'em little stories to get 'em singing
and maybe you let 'em play little
games."
Her song and game teaching
methods are considered so sociologically
significant that a California
woman is scheduled to make an
educational film of Bessie's work.
And in 1956, Bessie cut a record. "I
had been praying to have a record
for my children (she has three). So
they could hear my voice when I'm
gone. My father and mother didn't
have nothin' to give me."
Bessie, a great-great grandmother 
who lives on $88-a-month
Social Security, and--in good
years--earns $5,000-$6,000 singing
at colleges and churches across 


country, lives amidst clutter she has
collected over the years: dried flowers,
tambourines, dolls, bolts of
multicolored cloth, and several
crooked hanging dime store portraits
of Jesus.
"I got all this junk," she says,
waving her arm proudly around the
room that serves as her living
room-kitchen. Outside in the yard,
her five-year-old grandson, Frank
[his nae is Franklin], is banging a
stick against an old pot--accompaniment
for Bessie when she sings
to him. "He can stay with a tune!"
she says proudly.
The energetic great-grandmother
tells Frank to "hush up," 
and explains that her greatest hope
is to start a day school for crafts to
teach the old songs, games and
crafts to neighborhood children.
"It's important to teach these kids. 
If they take after the older ones,
they ain't got nothin' to do, 'cept
dope."
At this point, she reaches up to a
shelf and pulls down a stick figure
with moving joints and starts dancing
it on a board. "That's where you
got buck dancing from." It is one of
the amusements she enjoyed as a 
child that she would like to pass on
to this generation.
"I'm going to build that folk 
school," she says, "God willing."

Honoring America's Folk Heritage

By Richard Harrington

Fifteen men and women--
shapers, movers, founders and protectors 
of varied fold traditions--
accepted the thanks of a nation
Saturday evening as the National
Endowment for the Arts unveiled 

its first National Heritage Fellowships
at the Departmental Auditorium.
The ceremony had been 
moved inside from the Festival of
American Folklife because of intermittent
rain, but not a single
spirit was dampened.  On stage,
much of the hair was white or gray,
and the faces were tough with experience,
but the eyes were bright
and expectant.
The 15 ranged from craftspeople
who made sermons in wood 
or preserved history in ribbon and
ironwork to musicians who had inspired
or fine-tuned styles as disparate
as bluegrass, blues and cajun.
These are "the people who have
given this country a spiritual signature."
said folkorist Alan Lomax.
"This is the first time America has
turned around and given proper
credit where credit was due to the
folk tradition for having made
America a wonderful place to live 
in.
"In the last 50 years, we have
moved with giant strides toward
something we think of as social and
economic justice. Tonight we move
to an important new idea--cultural
equity, cultural democracy, where
we recognize that America's most
precious possession is its diverse 
cultural heritage."
The fellowships, which carry a
$5,000 cash honorarium and are
the first such honors at a national
level, were handed out by Frank
Hodsoll, chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, and Bess
Lomax Hawes, director of NEA's
Folk Arts Program. "These awards
are of the people and by the people
and for the people from the people
to the people," said Hawes. "I don't
think Mr. Lincoln would mind my
messing up his beautiful quotation
on this occasion."
The recipients seemed embarrassed
as well as proud, as if they
