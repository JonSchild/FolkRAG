Vaudou:
There is an old Haitian proverb, "Derriere morne, gagnin morne,"
which means, "Behind the mountains, there are other mountains," or
there is more here than meets the eye. And this proverb applies
Vaudou, equally as well as it does to Haitian topography.
The slaves brought their gods and their traditions with them from Africa. Some of these
gods are still worshiped, some of
the traditions still survive. Ogoun was the Nigerian war god. In Haiti
the marines had to subdue Haitian soldiers who believed that
Ogoun had made them invulnerable. In West Africa one of the principle dieties [deities]
was the snake god. In Haiti, Papa Domballa is the great chief of all the
loi or gods and his
title is Mait' Culevre," or "Master Snake." In Africa, one of the
principle religious phenomena was the possession of the devoteee [devotees]
by one or another of the gods and the performance by him at such times of
super-nromal [normal] physical feats. In Haiti, the fully initiated servitor of the loi,
is called the horse of Simbi or Agwetoywoyo or one of the others and when
one of the loi has mounted him, this individual [may do some rather remarkable
things --- handle red hot iron, eat glass and so on.]
