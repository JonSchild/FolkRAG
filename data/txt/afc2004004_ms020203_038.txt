it round here to get her hunderds and she fell on that stump.
Um-um, I hate to think about it. She fell over that stump and 
she hollered and so we run there, mama and papa and some
mo grown people, sittin up on the porch, they jumped up
and come on round there and she just said "O I'm just nearly 
dead.Just like I done broke my hip." That's what she said.
We couldn't find a bruised place on her nowhere. Just tore
her clothes off trying and couldn't find anything to find where she hurt /, but blood
came out of her mouth. Don't know why? and so they didn't 
even have a doctor with her.Just a little blood come out of 
her mouth. When she talked, you could see blood in her mouth
and my mama got a rag and wiped her mouth out. Wet the rag and 
wiped her mouth out. Thought she had busted her lip or bit
her tongue, but it wont nothing like that. The blood come
out of her stomach some way. So it didn't bleed any mo
through the night. So the next mornin' she couldn't hardly
walk. Just kinda drug that side. But mother rubbed her down in
some kerosene and some grease real down real good and let her 
lie roun all day. So the next day she's feelin' purty good, They 
never did have a doctor with her. We was so fur out there in 
the country I reckon my father--- cost eight dollars for the
doctor to come out there--well, 'scusin' the medicine he 
might bring. I reckon that might-a stopped my father, I don't
know, but I know they didn't have a doctor.
My sister was pretty close to twenty five I believe . She 
married at the age of twenty five I think my mother said
