Jean:  O me ! I'm sad yet sometimes when I sing. As long as
I've kent.  Sometimes I'd be singing these songs and the
tears dropping. That's what's wrong with me. I'm over-sensitive.
I've seen me singing a sentimental song in the house, and I
couldna carry on for a second or two. It affects me that way.
