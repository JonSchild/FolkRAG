Mr. Alan Lomax

Division of Music
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have had all sorts of trouble convincing Mr. William Berrien
of the Rockefeller Foundation that the initial step in the study
of folk music is the COLLECTION of it. The same project has been
reopened and left hanging fire for a number of years, and right
now it is up to Berrien to decide whether or not we can get the 
finds with which to operate. This institution here is without
funds, otherwise I would have gone ahead long ago.

Is there any possibility of getting a recording instrument on a
loan basis from the Library Archive in Washington ?  It would be
a great help if we could get one. I have purchased a few records
of the steel core variety that I can still use. Do you have any
in store there ?  I would like to send you a hundred or so records
of the most representative folk songs we have here before the Army
gets me. My tires have a little rubber on them yet and I can get 
around for awhile. Let me know if there is anything the Archive can
do to help me secure for them a good collection of traditional ballads
from this region.

We have with us Dr. Hannas, a well trained musicologist who can
utilize the material in some other fashion. Unfortunately, she is
not well acquainted with the people or the area to do much in the
way of field work, but I'll try to get her started before I go. I
would very much like to send something interesting and historically
important to the Library Archive and will appreciate anything you can 
do to help me do it. Perhaps you and Seeger and others can put a bug
in the ear of Mr. Berrien.

Sincerely,
A.L.Campa
