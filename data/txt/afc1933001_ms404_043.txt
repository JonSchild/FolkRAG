*Later, as I climbed up the
rocky hill, again headed
for Deming, I heard [her] the old woman of the desert who gave me the two parodies
sing cheerfully as she turned to 
her work:
"give me a girl with a [fat]
chubby [hound] fat hound,
an' a dimple in her cheek 
like a hole in a pan."
(To her put with introduction to The Parodies Country Song.)
