git ready, 'fore He git to it, ya know.
TL:  Is that right?
BJ:  No, ya jis' cain't, especially if you're expectin' for Him
to he'p ya!  You go out on, on yourself.  An' so that's where our
church got, got started, in my house.
     But, anyway, we jus', uh. . .If you jus' trus' God an', as I
former say, an' go on an' let Him do for you, you know, take your
time, why, He'll do it right.  But He, He, He knows the foundation
of your mind; He knows the foundation of what you really desire.
He say, "Anything you desire with your heart."  Now, don't think
because He say that, then you can jump up an' say, "I want, I 
want this; I want the other!"  See?                           He mean if it's,
if it's for ya.  If it ain't for you, you ain't gonna git ya, tha's all.
Um-hum.  If you desires it.  If you desires good things you'll git it.
      The devil'll gi' you the desire of your heart, too.  You
know?  'Cause because you ain't gonna desire nothin' but
things that suit him.  An' like that.
     But this, ah, woman preachin' propositions:  Me an' this lady,
she called me up there that day.  An' ah, I went by there.  I was 
very tired.  An' I sit there.  An' behold!, I found out what it
was for.  It's mo' for to try to win me from where we was havin'
church at -- 'cause we was havin' Church of God in Christ -- to
pull me on that side, wit' them, ya see?  an' an' show me that I
could come on up.  An' right then she woulda annointed me to be a 
preacher.  Ya see?  " 'Cause God called you to preach; you don't
know."  Say, "You's. . .say, you think."
     I says, "God called me to teach."  I was sittin' down on the 
sitee (setee).
