Dear Bessie,
the Asheville Folk Festival people have agreed to pay
expenses and $25.00 apiece for two more people from
the Island.  Would you write to these two people by 
air mail, special delivery, as soon as you get this
letter to ask them if they would like to join you
and the group in Asheville.  The quickest way to 
get an answer from them would be for them to telephone
me at the office,  GRamercy 7-4875.  They can
call collect.  My new home telephone is WAtkins 9-5292.  
They should call person-to-person.
We have only a few days left to make final plans,
so I hope you will do this immediately.
I'll probably see you in Asheville.
All best,
Alan Lomax
