     The most joyful things of my life?. . .WELL. . . Some of 
the most joyfulest things of my life I did yesterday.  I did love to

An then he'll git up an call huh ole cow, or ole bitch, or call huh
somethin like that.  You know?

rip and tear.  Do you feel intercourse cruel to the woman, Rev. D?)
