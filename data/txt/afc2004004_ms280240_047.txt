Chorus:
Crack, crack goes my whip, I whistle and I sing
I sit upon my wagon [and] I'm as happy as a king
My horses aye so willin' and for me I'm never sad
There's none could lead a jollier life like Jim the
Carters lad.

I used to sit upon my wagon and hear my father sing
As merrily as his whip said [could] crack and merrily did he sing
Crack, crack, etc.
