Salt Lake City, Utah

"Governor New recommended Grant Ivins (new Utah CPA Administrator)
for CAP Administrator after several times refusing his appointments in the
State Government, because he considered him incompetent.  He wasn't strong
enough for State Fish and Game head, but he's good enough for a big Federal
job."
