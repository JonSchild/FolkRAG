Toast To Hitler 

Here's to Hitler on his last hitch 
We're after him now the son of a bitch 
His prick will hang down like a rotten banana 
When he hear us sing the Star Spangled Banner 
We'll split his balls and drink his gin 
And screw every princess he has in Berlin 
We'll hang Old Glory all over the door 
And show him the spirit of the American boy 
From the home of the free and the home of the brave 
We'll all march down and shit on his grave.
