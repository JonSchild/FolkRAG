[As we ride along he often sings. The other day his song was
an appeal to Old Hannah (the sun) to go down.

"About three o'clock on a hot summer day de sun forgits
to move on down an' stops. Den de mens sing dis song:"]

It is a far cry from Iron Head['s] back to one of the standard
English ballads. Iron Head's version has never been printed as
it has been sung down the centuries, but the tune and the story
in every important detail follows the tale as it was sung around
castle walls when men rode to war[,] clad in armour[,] with their lady's
favor fluttering from [their] lance[s]. Here is what Iron Head
sang to me; the picture more vivid but the mood of sad reflection still the same:

Once I knowed old lady,
Round Tennessee she dwell;
She had a lovin' husband
but she loved young men's as well -

Love my darlin', oh!
I love my darlin', oh!

I'm goin' down by de doctor's shop,
Jest as straight as I can go,
See if I can't find some instrument round
dat place
Dat'll run my husband blind -

Love my darling, oh!
I love my darling, oh!

She only found two marrow-bones,
She made him eat them all.
and he says, "Now, my dear wife, I'm blind
And just can't see at all." -

Love my darlin', oh!
I love my darlin', oh!

Says, "I would go to the river and drown myself,
Honey, if I only knew the way."
She says, "No, my dear, come and go with me,
Mother 'fraid you'll run astray" -

Love my darlin', oh!
I love my darlin', oh!
