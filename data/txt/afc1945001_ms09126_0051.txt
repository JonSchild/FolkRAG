The Russans Campaign

In Moscow, the Russans are pushing back
the Germans.  What makes it so difficult for the
Germans is that they are not used to the snow,
and that the Russans wear white garments which
match the snow.  Then they attack with
out being seen.  They have skis and snow shoes, which
the Germans have not and so they can not get
around as fast as the Russans.

I have seen a movie; the title is named
"Moscow Strikes Back."  It was how the Germans
treated the people of Moscow and then how Moscow
in the end captured many Germans, and regained
their land
