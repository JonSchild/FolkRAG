F. N. M.

There was a soldier in camp 
that continued to walk around 
and keep saying, -- "This isn't it"  
He would walk and stop and say 
again, "This isn't it" So the captain 
told the Colonel that he had a 
demented soldier in his squad.  the 
colonel proceeded to draw up his 
discharge papers.  When the soldier 
was called to the office and saw the 
papers, he received the papers and 
said, "This is it!"
