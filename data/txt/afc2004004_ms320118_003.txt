Time Code:  Tape: 1300 cont. Canray Fontenot  2
knew the people who really started Cajun music, didn't you?
Your daddy, your uncle, your cousin, tell us about how it all
started.
Canray: It all started when I wasn't big enough to know
anything about the music. My daddy was an accordion player,
he probably had started very young. But in those days, nobody
would helpyou out because I know in my time, my daddy or my
mama would tell me, you do this or you do that, they wouldn't 
tell you that twice you know. And I imagine, knowing 
how I was raised, my daddy and them, it was worse. And then
he said a lot of times after mama died, youhad to take
care of the house, we had to take care of everything we had
around the place, you had to care of......... (Canray
is not terribly coherent, rambles a bit) ..... Daddy was
going out, we didn't know where......I think about that all
the time, that's something stays on my mind cause I known my
daddy, and I known some of his sisters and brothers, step
sisters.....but, he had two sisters and a brother, brother
and sister from the same momma and daddy. But I never know..
But still and all the old man was rough, so the old man
went and bought an accordion.........
AL: I was born 200 or 300 miles west of here, and I camer
here when I was 17, had by first drink of wine here, courted
my first girl here, and Louisiana's a special place for m. I
