Hungarian Club, which fronts at 8005
W. Jefferson St. in Delray, Detroit.

b) Two or three houses down the street
from 4467 16th St. on that side of 
the street.
c) On Vernor Highway just off of St. 
Antoine.
d) On Canfield off of St. Antoine.
e) On Chene st. just across from

Shall I proceed to [make] do further 
field work, preparing the way for [further] later

World's Fair. 
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
