Ain' Bothered a Bit

The Negro tells the "blues"to go to Hell. A "jus' nachuly
don' care", a "don' give a damn" song, in which "jivin'"
laughter, horseplay and whiskey are likely to mean razors and
pistols after a little while.


[* "Jiving," the equivalent of "kidding," "fooling,"
"joshing," is a very popular word among Louisiana
Negroes. It is sometimes applied to the secret language
or slang of certain local groups.*]
