"Them beans is a little hard, ain't they?" says Doc Killis Campbell,
while we-alls is eatin', bein' p'lite an' elegant like.  "Mebby they don't get
biled s'fficient?"

"Them beans is all right," says Gates Thomas.  "They be some hard,
but you can't he'p it none.  It's the altitood; the higher up you gets, the
lower heat it takes to bile water.  So it don't mush up beans like it should."

"That's c'rrect every time," says Julia Estill.  "I mind bein' over on
Enchanted Rock once, an' up near timber-line, an' I can't bile no beans at
all.  I'm up that high the water is so cold when it biles that ice forms on
it some.  I biles and biles on some beans four days, an' it don't have no
more effect than throwin' water on a drowned rat.  After persistent bilin'
I skims out a handful an' drops 'em onto a tin plate to test 'em, an' it 
sounds like buckshot.  As you say, it's the altitood."

to Belle Starr, by William James Battle (Publications No. MDCCCCXXXIV
