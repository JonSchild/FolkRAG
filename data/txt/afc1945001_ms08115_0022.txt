1. A Negro after having heard that
several Jap planes were shot
down, ran down the street
with arms stretched out
hollowing, we're going to 
win the war, and repeated 
the number of planes shot
down. "We are free, the war
will soon be over."  this 
fellow was amidst several
groups of people, and accidently
hit one on the nose.
The person hit, "Your freedom
[h] ends right where my 
nose begins."
