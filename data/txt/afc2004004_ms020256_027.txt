AL:  What did they do with they boy?
BJ: Nothin', 'cause they had hired 'im to kill 'im.
AL:  You mean the police had hired him to kill him?
BJ: Um, they musta did, 'cause ain't nobody kill him.  Ain't nothin'
done to him.
AL:  Nobody arrested him?
BJ: Oh, yes, he was arrested for a day or two.  You  know, that's
