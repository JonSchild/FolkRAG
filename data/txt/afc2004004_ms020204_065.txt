don't believe in religion, don't believe in God. They just
out in the world...
A: What do you mean they don't have anything to think about?
They can think about the world?
[*A sketch of the notion of "conscience."*]
V: They can think about the world all right, but they just don't
have nothin' strong enough in their heart to think that's
wrong to do that. They just don't know whether tha's wrong or
no and if they know Christ and have got religion
why something within em will tell um that's not right, not
do that-- some kinda mind will tell you, just reasonin to ye,
I wouldn't do that, that's wrong. I don't believe I'll do that.
It don't look right, it doesn't sound right, that's the religion
part and if you ain't got that religion in your heart why you
just don't care, just go on. Just do whatever you want to do
whether it's wrong or right. Just go on and
feel like nothin', think no more of it, think you haven't
done nothin because you don't know anything about Christ.
A: Did you ever have any visions in which you actually saw
the Lord or Jesus or did your visions come to you in terms of
songs or something.
[*the vision*]
V; Well, I never have the visionjust to see just the Lord himself.
Well, I've heard of people --- the lady down there now, her name
is Rosy Travis, she says that she saw a face one mornin'---
says it looks like it was so fur up in the sky till you just
could see the face, but anyway you could see enough to tell
that it was a face. And said that she just wondered and wondered.
