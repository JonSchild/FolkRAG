Dear Dr. Spivacke:

I wish to submit a breakdown of the additional budget which I have recommended be allocated to the current recording trip of John. A Lomax in the Southwest:

20 records, plus shipment          20.00
Per diem and travel                     130.00

                                   Total           150.00
                                   Respectfully yours, 

Alje                  Alan Lomax
