H.S. Sophomore- White-Female

1.  There were four ships in that were 
sunk during a battle, and there was 
only one life boat available.  So all of 
the survivors of [of] the four ships had 
to get in this one boat. These boats were 
of different nationalities, American, German, 
British, and Italian.

   When all the survivors were in 
the boat the commander said that there 
were too many and that three men 
would have to jump overboard.  So an 
American said "God Bless America" and 
jumped, a Britisher said "There will 
always be an England" and he jumped 
and then a German said "Heil Hitler" 
and pushed an Italian overboard.
