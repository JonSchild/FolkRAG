September 26, 1942

My dear Dr. Lomax:

We were delighted to hear from Mr. Tenley
that you had accepted the invitation of our Chapter to
give us a talk on "American Folk Music" at our first
meeting. It will be held at Epiphany Church, 1317 G Street
on Monday, October 5th. Our business meeting starts at
8 o'clock and lasts about half an hour. Then we have our
"special event" of the evening, and light refreshments
afterwards. Mr. Tenley told me that you would like to
have a record player available. I have ordered a very 
good new one for myself and hope that it will be here in 
time. It should be. In any case I shall see that a good
one is there for your use. 

We feel very honored indeed to have you with
us that evening to start our year off right. If there
is anything you might want, let me know. I shall be out
of town most of this week, but either thru Mr. Tenley
or Mr. Torovsky, organist of Epiphany, we shall be glad
to do anything that you may want done. 

I am looking forward with great pleasure to
meeting you and hearing you. 

Very sincerely,
Jean Slater Appel
Mrs. Jean Slater Appel, Dean
