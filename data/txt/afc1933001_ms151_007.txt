Dear Mr. Spivaki:
Miss Sarah Gertrude Knott, Director of the National Folk Festival
and Supervisor of Folk Festivals for the Coronado Cuarto Centennial celebration,
has suggested that I write you for help on a story I am preparing
on Spanish-American folk dances in connection with the Coronado
Folk Festivals.
We have almost no material available on the subject in our local
libraries. I wonder if it would be too much trouble to send me what information
you can gather in the Library of Congress.
I am particularly interested in finding out everything I can about La
Varsoviana; all the different points of view on its origins (some say Polish,
some French, etc.); its transition from a peasant to a ballroom dance,
popular in European capitals (if possible how it happened to be taken over
by European society), various ideas on how in was brought to America, by
what groups and when; its use today by different racial groups in the United 
States and other countries, variation in different versions, and meaning of
the name, anecdotes connected with the dance.
Do you know whether there are words in other languages similar or
different from the Spanish words:

Comadre Juana, comadre Juana,
Comadre Juana, venga abailer,
La Varsoviana, la Varsoviana,
La Varsoviana que van a tocar.

 Compadre Pancho,  Compadre Pancho
 Compadre Pancho, , venga a sacar
La Varsoviana, La Varsoviana
La Varsoviana, que van tocar."

Is the dance in Washington? I am particularly eager for colorful
human interest touches as well as factual material. By what groups and
where is the dance used most? I do appreciate any help you can give me.
