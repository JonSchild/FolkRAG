Reverend Roe.  Reel 5.  P. 6
"It8's a lie; you did say."  And that was a [fact] fight!  And so they went 
after it; he got down off his old horse, and Old Man scribe [just] hit him 
one lick and just knocked him out.  And he fell out, and when he kinda 
come to hisself.  And ["Then I want to tell my side,"]"I'm gonna tell Marse Zack," he says. "You
hit me with a rail."  (laughter)
A:  You want to tell what?
R:  Marse Zach.
A:  Hit him with a rail?
R:  Hit him with a rail (laughter).  And so we used to tell when the 
boys, you know, [big] his boys, we used to say that, you know, when we'd 
meet [him] um, you know (laughter).
[We was all] All of um was Republicans; don't [say else] tell one he's a Democrat.  Did 'twas a fight.
A:  And then they, when they didn't vote any more.
R:  They passed that law -- that's some grandfather's clause, [you know]
they called it. They stopped them from voting for a long time.  However, I think 
they're voting down there.
[All] O the people, the colored people, have been treated awful bad down in 
that country -- whipped drove like cattle; you'd go down on those bottoms 
and you'd never get away unless you can just slip out and run away, then 
you'd have to leave your family.  It was awful bad in those days; when we 
didn't have any help nobody to help us.  But thank God, it's gittin' better.
