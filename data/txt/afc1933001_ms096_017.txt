Dear Mr. Spivacke:
You ask for a "report" on my trip.  I send herewith a copy of a report I make - on demand from your office - on my first trip dated sometime in August. Along with it went an account of my expenses.  This account, as usual, came back to me. I corrected and forwarded it in the latter part of August. Miss Rogers wrote that the second try was successful and that my money would be forthcoming promptly. Since then, silence, although I have written more than once.

I then made a second trip of two or three thousand miles. About
