"A fellow who just got back from Iceland -- he's on a furlough --
a soldier -- told me that the Americans were anything but welcome up
there.  The natives don't want them and consider them just as much
trespassers as the Germans would be.  He says they just don't want to
have anything to do with us up there.  Who owns Iceland?  Denmark?"
