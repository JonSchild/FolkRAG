And the D's all laugh at me
as I was going there
The next thing he give was
and old gray nag
All saddled all bridled
- throw my leg across
I throw my leg across, I
give him the steel
Another stiff necked devil
 run away through the deal
The 3rd thing he give me was an
old long gun
To put again my shoulder
and play my tongue upon
I put it agin my shoulder &
it begin to smoke
An I gave my poor shoulder
[nw?] a devil of a poke
It was Capt. McGuive -
,I'll have you retire
