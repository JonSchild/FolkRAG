tambours officiate at as many kinds of dances
-- the congo, the voodoo and the mascaron.
Then there seem to be innumerable cantefables.
Each of these categories comprise,
so I am informed, literally hundreds of melodies
--- French, Spanish, African, mixtures
of the three. The radio and the sound movie
and the phonograph record have made practically
no coltural impression, so far as I 
can discover, except among the petit-bourgois
of the coastal cities. Their influence does
not seem to have penetrated to the poor people,
the really poor people, at all. And American
jazz is hardly known here at all except among
the rich who have visited America. Composition,
by which I mean folk composition,
is still very active. And so I think I can 
say that unless a piece of sky falls on my
head this trip will mean some beautiful,
valuable and interesting records for the Library's
collection.
I begin to boast more than is safe and besides
this letter is already overly long. Next time
I will, if you like, send you a few sample
records with notes and explanations.
Let me thank you again for the marvellous
opportunity you have given me. I remain,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
