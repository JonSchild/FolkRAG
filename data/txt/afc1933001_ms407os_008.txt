old jail ballad:

As to drinkin? and gamblin? I never [?] [?]
And I don't give a damn for a ly'in in
jail.
But its hard times in the Meridian jail
Its hard times, po' boys.

The chuck they give us is beef and corn and,
as old as Hell and as heavy as lead.
It's hard times in the Meridian jail,
It's hard times, po' boys.

But Bob had many friends.
Soon he would be free again. And
again he would be away to west
Texas and up the trail to Kansas
Hightailing a long herd of long
horn cattle.

Through Bob and his 
likes my interest in [fack?]
tunes was kept astir. The
drifting herds of longhorns
with their singing [nightterday?], their
crooning cattle calls, wound
through the Barogue hills. I 
absorbed masses of the romance
of their times, just as a plant
absorbs the rain and sunshine
My father used to say that he came
from Mississippi to Texas to give
his eight boys room to expand.
