friendship.  It ain't worth it, at all. Jus' pass it up. An' 
you keep a-doin; that then, then, ya learn ta grow to, to not
to -- people'll never know.  An' so's, "I cain't understand 'er."
Jus' like me, "I cain't make 'er mad...I cain't do so-an'--"   Why
they -- an' they'll let ya alone doin' it.  'Cause you
done drove the devil away; you done overpowered the evil spirit.
See?
[*(EVIL THOUGHTS VS ACTIONS)*]
I hear peoples say, "Ya just as wust to do a thing as to
think it."  But that's one of the biggest lies you ever will hear 
in ya life.  That is a long, wrong lie.  'Cause when you sayin'
when you wanna do things, that's a lie. A want be comin' any time.
See?  You, ah, ah, because that's a, you know, a thirst for sumpthin', 
a desire for sumpthin', liable to come at any time, ya see?
But you ain't got to do it. You can git angry an' say, "I feel
like killin' ya."  An' you feel that way. An' you be so mad you
jus'...at that time.  But if you jus' go ahead an' overpower that,
why, you ain't killed.  As long as you ain't killed, why, you
ain't done that. You haven't committed your sin.  Ya see!  I'd
rather a person that wanna kill me all his lifetime, than to kill
me. Ya see? An', hah, as long as ya don't do it, why,
ya ain't did it. See? An' so that's it.

An' that's what I knew that, that that word about, "You just
as well as to," ah, ah, that's why folks'll try to say about
Holiness peoples.  Say that, "You show your sin 'cause you just as
wust as to do a thing as to wanna do it!"  That's crazy!  If, if I
wanna cut your throat today an' [don't] never do it, d-d-don't you know I
ain't drawed your blood?  An' long as I, long as I overpowers that
evil want, why, I, I have overpowered sin? Ya see. Ya overpower it. Then-
An' so that's what brings on great joy an' great peace, great love.
