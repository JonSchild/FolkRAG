Washington, D.C. 
Dear Mr. Kane: 
I am replying to your letter of May 26 respecting a check-up on the rumor of Jewish men escaping the draft. 
This rumor has come to our attention several times. About a month ago we talked with Dr. Likert about it. A check-up here shows that there are no data, either available or obtainable, on the number of Jewish men in the Army. No record is kept of religion, in any office. Our surveys ask the question of religion and we have some data on attitudes of Jewish soldiers, but we do not feel that the ordinary sampling methods would suffice for getting an accurate check on the number of Jews in the Army. Moreover, there is some hesitance on the part of Jewish soldiers in telling that they are Jewish. These may be few, but with a Jewish population of, say, only 5% an absolute error of 1% would actually include 20% of the Jews. 
Some of us have been trying to think how the problem might be attacked initially by a pilot study in some city. Consider a place like Trenton, New Jersey. A Jewish research organization in New York, in which Dr. L. L. Dublin of Metropolitan Life is a leading figure, has made recently a house-to-house canvass resulting in what is believed to be a complete enumeration of all Jews in this and several other cities. Now if the name, age, and occupation of each Jew of military age could be obtained it might be possible to go to the local draft board and see exactly what happened to him -- deferment, selection, or volunteer enlistment. Jewish data could then be compared with non-Jewish data. 
Unofficially, Dr. A. J. Jaffe in our office has been in contact with Dr. Sophia Robison of O.C.D., who was formerly in charge of the Jewish population studies referred to above. Mrs. Robison is now trying to get the sponsors of this Jewish research organization to put up the money for a complete check-list of Jews in such a city as Trenton, with the thought that Selective Service or some other official agency might check this list against the local draft board records.
