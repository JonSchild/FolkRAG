Minutes of the Joint Planning Project Committee on Rumor -- July 24, 1942

Present: Intensive Surveys Division, Woodward and Riley, Extensive Polls Division, Cisin; Sources Division, Curl; Media Division, Martin; Special Services Division, Horowitz, Designated Secretary for Committee. 

The meeting opened with a review of the memorandum from Eugene Katz, Special Services Division, to Mr. Cornelius DuBois, dated July 18, 1942. This was followed by examination of the specially prepared memorandum presented by Riley. This was a memorandum on Study S68, a study of war-time rumors in two different communities, and dated July 24, 1942. Discussion resulted in the following plans for coordination of our study: 

Polls will not undertake a special study of rumor at this time. Their interviewers will cooperate as a field staff and send in rumors they hear. In future repeat studies after the results of the intensive study by Surveys are available, Polls will be expected to undertake nation-wide analyses on its sampling basis.

Special Services is to receive rumors from nation-wide cooperating field staffs and is to arrange with Media and Sources for analysis of the incidence of different types of rumor by content. Media and Sources having participated in the rumor content analysis will then undertake news analyses in parallel categories to relate to relevent frequencies of rumors noted. The rumors once analyzed for incidence by content will be turned over to Special Services for further special analyses as may seem warranted. If enough rumors are reported with age, sex, class data, they are to be turned over to Surveys for help with quantitative analysis. 

Surveys will undertake an intensive study of the dynamics of rumor in accordance with their preliminary memorandum referred to above and the preliminary field tests project for the week of July 27th. 

After the data are all in and preliminary analyses available, there will be a joint meeting of this committee to review the coordinated results so that reports may be prepared with maximum significance.

Specific date decisions were as follows; The week of July 27th, Surveys will go into the field for a pretest, and Polls will try a little bit of pretesting. July 28th, Riley and Cisin (Of Surveys and Polls) will meet to agree upon some working definition  of rumor based upon field pretest. This definition will be forwarded to Special Services to be available for the 29th, so that field staffs of cooperating agencies can be instructed with maximum clarity. 

For the two week period of August 3rd to 15th, Surveys will be in the field on their intensive study. The week of August 3rd
