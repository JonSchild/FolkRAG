to come there? But it really was
fun - parades, a [kind] sort of lousy
Bataille des Fleurs, and at night
a kind of exodus of the population
to the streets where everyone
would walk up and down and
throw confetti in your face &
try to kiss you if you weren't
pretty damn quick. And lots
of bands & music until late at
night.

At this point a few remarks
about French soldiers are necessary.
I'm having lots of fun figuring
out the difference between
Americans & the French, and the
soldat has the [stron] essence
but the next we nearly heckled him
to death. It was the pleasantest
evening I've spent in France. And
Leon was swell. If I could just
smoke a cigarette like Leon I
would have a little bit of France
to carry along with me home.
    
It's very exciting - knowing these
boys. I'm learning more every day.
There's so much I can't understand
about all these people - things like
why no French girl that I've yet
seen looks really young, why the
French sailors run in packs and
team up together to get through
crowds and to kiss the girls they want
to Carnival night, and why the
French soldiers on the other hand
go about in two's and three's and
don't give a damn for each other
really - they'd as soon be with anyone
else -, and why French men & French
women smoke their cigarettes so
differently, and why lots of things that
I'll tell you about next time.
    
Why don't you write, you beasts? Tell me
about Charlie & Ruth & Nick & Jean & the CJO
& yourselves. [Write] Right away, please. All my love
Bess
