TWO LITTLE SISTERS- cont'd

"Oh, dear miller, take my hand"
Sing I dum, sing I day
"Drag me safe into the land"
The boys are the best for me.

The miller took her by the hand
Sing I dum, sing I day
And drug her safe into the land
The boys are the best for me

The miller robbed her of her gold
Sing I dum, sing I day
And threw her in a great deep hole
The boys are the best for me

The miller was hung up on a gallows high
Sing I dum, sing I day
And the oldest sister was burned close by
The boys are the best for me
