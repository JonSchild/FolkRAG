ROSA DEAR
(Holland)
(Page 46 - One Hundred Folk Songs of All Nations.)
Rosa dear, will you dance then?
Dance Rosa, dance, Rosa,
Rosa, dear, will you dance then?
Dance Rosa sweet,
Rosa with her hat of flower,
Neither wealth nor land has she,
But dances sweetly.
Rosa, dear, will you dance then?
Dance Rosa, dance, Rosa,
Rosa, dear, will you dance then?
Dance, Rosa sweetl.
