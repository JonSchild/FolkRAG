Interview with Hugh McGraw
[*Picnic*]

McGraw: . . . . . . Holly Springs singing held each year. . . .
oh delicious, I done overeating, I got me an extra helping
of the banana pudding.   These women, they want everybody
to take some of their sweets, some of their pies, some of 
their puddings.   This is the annual singing at Holly Springs
primitive Baptist Church.   We hold it every year first Sun.
in June and the Sat. before and we've got a typical crowd
here this year of what we usually have every year.  Then
we have a fall session, this singing, first Sun. in Nov.
We don't have near the crowd in November.

AL:   This is the people who belong to this area.

McGraw:   It's Homecoming, It's Decoration Day.
