Rumor [?] 
Kane 
223

In a Business andProfessional group of women, there was much
discussion about a rumor that the Germans were infiltrating into
the unpopulated areas of N.E.Canada, preparatory to a drive by
plane into our middle West areas, around Chicago and Detroit,
a smart move because all our boys are congregated at the coasts.

A couple just back from Miami were talking about the thousands [*5*]
of Southern negroes working on a new cantonment. In talking to the 
local people they found they were getting white man's wages, same [*7a*]
scale as given in the north. Terrible because it raises the now
unbearable national debt unnecessarily. These wages not necessary
because of the much lower standard of living in the South. Is
bad also because the Negroes are not used to having so much money
and are spending wildly thus helping inflation.

A school-teacher (one of those language teachers forced to cease 
teaching German and take on Spanish or French and so slightly
jaundiced and tired) said- "Good Neighbor policy, my eye. We're 
just as good grabbers as Hitler. All we want of South America is 
what we can get out of her economically."

Two men talking about the cuff-less trousers- "All hooey, just
a chance to give some more pay-rollers jobs ckecking up. What do they
think cuffs were put on trousers for in the first place-certainly
not for beauty but to hold the pants-legs down. Now they'll have to
use some other heavy material for that purpose. And another thing-
banning the extra pair of trousers is the most extravagant move that 
could be made. The object of the two-pants suit is to make the
suit last longer. Sidney Hillman must be back of that ruling, drumming
up more trade for the tailors.
