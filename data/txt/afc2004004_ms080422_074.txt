Tape:  894  Nimrod Workman   1
Nimrod sings:
42 years is a might long time
For the laborer. . . .
Down in that coal mine.  (he continues)
Nimrod:  I got mine and. . . . 's picture, she's got it hanging
up in there.  And he invited me to. . . . with him and I went. . . . .
AL:  You actually picketed Senator Bird, didn't you?
Nimrod:  Did I?  I had about 14 busloads. . . . . in Washington.
I first went hunting for him at the White House, and the
general, and all his guards, come out and was going to arrest
me.  And they was already tearing off and I had a whole bunch
of things I had to sign down there you know.  They was
tearing 'em all to pieces, this big dinner.  Said, listen
Mister Workman, you know we can put you in jail?  Did you
know we would take you to jail.  I said, no, I didn't
know you would.  I said what for?  They said for picketing
the White House, the U.S. government.  Nobody tries to
picket signs at the White House.  I said, Mr, I'm not
trying to get into the White House.  I said if you don't like
them, tear them off (they'd already tore 'em off anyhow.)  I
said, tear 'em off, but if you put me in jail, you have to
feed me.  And he got tickled, and he went round and said, you
get off this hill.  I don't care where you carry 'em down in
the city, but you can't carry signs, not on Capital Hill,
that says youre against the United States Capitol and president
I said I'm not carrying them against the president, I'm against
