8) Look down, look down by my bedside,
    You'll see a basin standing.
    A basin standing full of blood
    Was shed for Barbrie Allen.
9) He turned his face unto the wall,
    I'll do to one, I'll do to all.
    He bid adieu to all his friends
    And slighted Barbrie Allen.
10) Go mother, mother, make my bed,
    Make it both long and narrow,
    For that young man has died today,
    And I will die in sorrow.
11) Go father, father, dig my grave,
    Dig it both long and narrow,
    For that young man has died today,
    And I will die tomorrow.
12) So when in the churchyard they did lay,
    They layed them both together,
    What a happy couple they might have been
    If they'd have loved each other.

That's a good one...
Lomax: That's a magnificent song!
Joe: Ain't it!
Lomax: Now tell me, why was the basin of blood lying there?
Joe: Don't know what was the cause of that.
Lomax: Was that part of his sickness?
Joe: I should say so, yes. Well, he was broken-hearted.
Lomax: Had he been wounded, or . . .
Joe: No, no no. . .
Lomax: Do you know where this happened. . . 
Joe: No, I never did hear.
Lomax: Or how long ago it was?
Je: Oh a long while ago, you see. . . that's an old song.
Lomax: Is it a true history?
Joe: Yes, that's a true song, they reckon, you know.
