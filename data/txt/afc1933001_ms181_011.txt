Dear Miss Stierhem:

I wish I could take all the credit for the MENC conference 
demonstration but, sadly enough, I can't. The conference 
itself was very friendly and the committee which sponsored 
us was headed by Glenn Gildersleeve, State Supervisor of 
Music, Deleware, which was only one of the activities of 
his committee which is called "American Unity through Music 
Committee".

I wish you could have been there to take pictures of the 
demonstration itself. Peter Bowers, a banjo player, and 
Barbara Bell, a ballad singer, and myself gave an illustrated 
demonstration of folk songs and then Lilla Belle Pitts of 
Teachers College, Columbia University, showed how a class of 
ordinary Milwaukee children reacted to our performance. The 
whole affair, which lasted two hours, was cheered to the echo 
by a capacity audience of music educators from all over the 
country. I think the result will be that the folk songs which 
we have been collecting for years will be used in large numbers 
in school text books of all kinds. It should be remarked, however, 
that we are not anxious to replace European folk songs in
the text books so much as to add to them a representative cross
section of our own stuff. This cross section will include, I
think, many a song in French, Spanish and other minority origins 
current in the United States.

I think you are right about this being a good story. Perhaps you
might come to Washington some time and we could give you an outline
of the whole thing and then pick up the other pieces from other
