CO'OP'RATIVE
Tune: Sweet Adaline.

Co-op'rative!  Co-op'rative!
You are to me
A way to live.
In all my dreams,
Your ideals gleam.
You're the essence of my life
Co-op'rative.

CO-OPERATE
Tune: Tipperary.

It's a good thing to co-operate,
It's the best way we know.
It's a good thing to co-operate,
As on our way we go.
We're builders of life and beauty;
God's abundance round us flows.
It's a grand good way to help each other
So we'll co-operate.

CONSUMERS ARE HERE
Tune: Hail!  Hail!  The gangsall here.

Hail!  Hail!  Consumers are here,
Here to build together,
Here to help each other,
Hail!  Hail!  Consumers are here,
Here to build co-ops right now.

CO-OPERATURE BUILDER
Tune:  He's a Jolly Good Fellow

For he's a co-operative builder,
He's a co-operative builder,
He's a co-operative builder,
And he's a friend of mine.

Everything tangible was first conceived in
thought.

No man is found wholly between his hat and his
boots.

Every man has within him a mind with which to
build well-being for his fellow men.  Herein
lies joy, happiness and security.

Man sees that he cannot be the man he ought to
be without cooperating with others.

To think cooperation is the first step towards
building cooperatives.
