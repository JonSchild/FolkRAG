AL         Tell me a littlke about that.

:            Yeah, I used to go to dance, country
dance, you know, and have a good time you see. Of course I
had to learn how to play the fiddle first. I started young,
about six years old. And a lot of French people, them old
people, you know, I used to go there, they had the fiddle, 
you know. Then I liked music. And I used to go then. And
they play for me. That's the way I learned you see, how to
play fiddle, hm-mm, from those people.

spoke French and played the fiddle also?

mother, too.
