had 'er too close, ya know?  I felt that!  I said, "Gertrude, you
bit me."  I hadn't had but one teeth pulled in my life then.  I
said, "I'm gonna show ya how bitin' feel."
     An' she started off that way an' I just pushed 'er against
the wall.  I never hit 'er.  Never hit 'er a lick yet.  She's
daid now.  I never -- but I pushed 'er against the wall an' I bit 'er
about fo' times.  Bit 'er -- Pulled the plug out that woman there!
Hah!  Every time I bite, I       ov' on this side an'
then git the plug.  I jus' caught 'er on that jaw.  Oow boy!  I
said, "I wanna show ya how it feel.  That's all."
     That time [I bit she,] when she made, made 'er duck, tri-tried to go
under, scr-screetch 'er haid down toward the, the bench we had
there for to sit on.  She ah, see Mr. Wiley.  "My Wiley, y'all
ain't gonna stand there an' see 'er beat me, aye you?"
     Wiley [standin' there!] ain' sayin'. An' I ain' hit 'er a lick! Hit 'er
an' everything!
     An' so, that time Mr. Mummon, the man that married my mother
but he wa'n' -- he didn' know my mother then.  See, I knowed
him long years befo' Mama ever seen 'im.  But the old fella, he
come by there.  He had a water bucket.  He always [mess] meddle in
folks' business.  "Look at that great big woman, beatin' that
lil' woman!"
     I said, "What is you got to do with it?"  An' I pulled out
behind him!  Ha, ha, ha!  Down to the Lake he went!  Ha, ha, ha,
ha.  Ha, he had -- That's all I say!
     He teased me about that thing after he married Mama.  He come
to be my same step-father, for years.  I loved him too!  Ha, ha,
ha.  But I jus' wan'd (wanted) him to shut up.
     See, all them look like tryin' to make sumpin' noisy about it
