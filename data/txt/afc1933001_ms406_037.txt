twelve weeks, all time putting off the wedding that much longer.
And I guess it'd 'a' been just as well if I had put if off for always.
 
        "The lady had a lot of books, most of 'em religious books and
hymn book. One of 'em called Christian Harmony Note Book, as I 
recollect the name.  It had ' The Romish Lady' in it. And that's 
where I learned the rest of the words.  I had plenty of time to learn
'em and sing in the evenings.  I don't know what I would have done
without my tune singing, and the burnt lady said she didn't know
what they would have done neither without me a-singing. I sure
was glad to learn the rest of 'The Romish Lady'."
