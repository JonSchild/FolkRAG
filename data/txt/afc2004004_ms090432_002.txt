A memorandum About the July Trip to Coahoma County
Functional approach to the Study of Folklore

I. The following pertinent material is available in the field work notes and 
interviews of Mr. Young and Mr. Adams.

1. There has been adequate documentation of the preference pattern in 
relation to musical instruments. The piano ranks first and the 
guitar second, for most of the informants. A very religious person 
will include the organ in first or second place and a young person 
interested in dancing includes the saxophone in first or second 
place.

2. The five or six most favored songs of a group of approximately 100 
individuals is available. This material correlates well with the 
secular-sacred preference pattern of these individuals, described 
below. No effort was made to document the titles obtained.

3. The secular - sacred preference pattern comes clear in the 100 interviews. 
Age of the informant is the most important factor in urban 
or rural residence. The main pattern seems to be:

Sixteen to thirty - Blues frankly liked. Dancing 
indulged in and defended. Modern city jazz preferred 
as dance music. Spiritual and hymns occupy
a second place as songs for more serious occasions. 

Thirty to fifty - Blues are generally disapproved
of rather more by women than men. Religious music
given first rank. Attitude towards dancing varies
between "I can't do the modern steps" and "it is
wrong."

Over Fifty. Secular music is the devil's work.
Dancing is a sin, ect.

4. Numerous song texts noted rather inaccurately.

5. A few good personality portraits by Mr. Adams

6. Much good material on the change of attitude toward person
and churchly conduct in the last 50 years.

7. Good material on the importance of the folk medicine practiced
by midwives and grannies.

8. A few paraphrased folk tales.

9. Lists of popular phonograph records with no bibliographical data.
