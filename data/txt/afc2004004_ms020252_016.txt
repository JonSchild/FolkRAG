2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 12, P. 3

BJ: No.  Well You see, when there ain't nothin' in ya, and you
know the Lawd did send ya, why, you just stay a little while
and let Him gi' to ya.  If He don't gi' you nothin', why,
you know, outa the Book right them, He gi' ya [a singin'] explainin' talk --
teachin'.  Just stand there and jus' [sing] sayin' something you know that
is right and you [can't know] carryin' on until He [send] bring it to ya.  Not unless
you sing a song.  And [then He'll] let Him bring to to you right 'tween
the song and then, then just as soon as you get through that, you can
just turn [the] your Book, you see?  And next tine you [hit] get one you'll
just know the other one, and know the other one,  it just comes
like that; jus' come on to ya.  Tha's all...Oh, yeah, how many
times I walk up there and wondered, said there was nothin' in me,
[and] I don' know where I'm goin' but wherever He sen' me, I go.
And so.  Tha's all.  Jus' stay there a while and sing a song,
you know, gi' em some explainin'  and talkin' and while you're
talkin', it'll come.  It'll come to you jus' what to do.  See.
And I know that's the bes' way I feel good at that because I
ain' studied up and planned out, "I'm gonna tell 'em this; and then, I'm
gonna  tell 'em that,"  and all that kinda stuff --, I don't think I could make it, I know I couldn';
I ain't never done it yet.  I've layed in my bed and jus'
jus' get up all the meanin' of every single word -- go through
all the, all the reference, you know.  And get it all completely down,
just rhymed up jus' really good.  And then go to the church just as
blank as if it wasn't ever even read to me.  It ain't for me to
do, tha's why.  Ha, ha!  Jus' as blank as a piece of paper without
any writin' at all.  So I don't  have no-- there is times I want
certain scriptures; I keep them written down.  You know, when
I want certain scriptures, sometime I write them down.  And sometimes
I don't have to write [them] it down because, you see, in my
Book, I look, I can see where I [do] due to go.  You see?  Jus' see
