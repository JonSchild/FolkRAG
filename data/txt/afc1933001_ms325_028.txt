PAGETWO          THE HIGHLANDER FLING          MARCH {{??}}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Labor Organizes Political 
          Body on Statewide Basis
     A further step toward statewide
political organization for
labor was taken in December,
when the Tennessee League for
Progressive Democracy was set
up at a Chattanooga convention
of workers and union leaders.
     The organization was formed as a
unit of Labor's Non-Partisan League,
whose Executive Vice-President, E.
L. Oliver, came to the city to address 
the delegates. Officers elected are William
Turnblazer, president, Edward, 
F. Callaghan, vice-president, Paul
D. Ragon, secretary.
     The Monteagle local of American
Federation of Teachers sent delegates
who were active in the convention,
William Buttrick serving as temporary 
secretary and Myles Horton as
chairman of the nominations committee.

SOME EVENTS
(Continued from page 1)
     Myles Horton attended the CIO
national convention in San Francisco 
and spent two months in California
telling people about Highlander.
-----
     Zilphia Horton has spent the winter
organizing for the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers in Nashville.
-----
     The school has been helping lime
workers at Sherwood, Tennessee,
make plans for a union medical cooperative.
J. D. Bradford, a Highlander
alumnus, is president of the
A. F. of L. local there.
-----
     James Dombrowski was a delegate
to the United Christian Conference
on Democracy, at Cleveland, Ohio,
January 23-25.
-----
     Mary Lawrance has been holding
educational classes for teamsters and
other union workers in Louisville,
Ky., for the past two months.
-----
     We are fortunate to have on hand
now a beautiful collection of colored
slides (to be projected on a screen),
taken of the children at the nursery
school. There are also a few slides of 
the community and of activities at 
Highlander. Groups interested in
having these pictures shown at their 
meetings should write to Jim Dombrowski.
It might be possible for a
staff member to show the films, if
the distance to be traveled is not too
great and the season not too busy.

POLL TAX FIGHT GAINS NATIONAL
          ATTENTION; CASE AROSE IN GRUNDY
     Initiated in Grundy County, with
the help of Highlander staff members,
the court battled over poll tax requirements
for voting is moving into
the spotlight of national interest.
     Henry Pirtle of Tracy City, county
sear four miles north of Highlander
Folk School, did not pay his poll tax
last year. For this reason he is denied
the right to vote by Tennessee laws.
But for a special election to choose a 
representative to Congress last fall
Pirtle asked the Federal Court at
Nashville to intervene against election
officials who withheld the ballor.

Legal Arguments
     The case is now before the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals and is expected
to continue on through the
Supreme Court before the battle 
ends. The legal argument of Pirtle's 
appeal is based on the contention that
a state does not have power to tax a 
federal function and by doing so the 
state infringes upon the sovereignty 
of the United States.
     Pirtle is backed by the Civil Rights
Committee of the Southern Conference
for Human Welfare, which has

retained Crampton Harris of Birmingham
as legal counsel.

Double Attack
     The Committee, whose Chairman
is Mayor Maury Maverick of San
Antonio, is making a double-barrelled
attack on the poll tax evil. A
bill designed by the Committee has 
been introduced in Congress by Representative
Lee Geyer (Dem., Cal.).
If passed into law, it would prevent
any state from making payment of
poll taxes a requirement for voting 
for federal officials.
     Millions of workers in the South
will find themselves able to exercise
their own free choice in elections
if this campaign succeeds - millions
formerly denied the ballot or "voted"
by political bosses who paid for their 
tax receipts.
     Joseph Gelders of Birmingham,
secretary of the Civil Rights Committee,
has been raising funds to
help support this fight by the sale
at one cent each of stamps for use
on the backs of letters. Each stamp 
bears the slogan: "Abolish Poll Taxes!
Free America First!"

MATTERS FINANCIAL
     Last summer Highlander's
Plymouth coach was limping so 
badly we decided it had to have 
a thorough overhauling. After
being hauled off the Tennessee
River ferry by a tractor because
the worn out clutch wouldn't 
pull, Bill Buttrick arrived with
the car at a Chattanooga garage
- to be informed that the total 
repair bill would amount to 
$140. And that was the end of
the car's service to Highlander.
It was left with the dealer in exchange
for a credit of $275. Now 
unless we buy a new car before
May first we shall lose the credit.
Who will supply $500 to pay 
the auto dealer.
     Highlander has a motion picture
film - PEOPLE OFTHE CUMBERLAND -
known as one of the 
outstanding  documentary films in

the country. It has been preserved
for posterity by the deposit of a copy
in the United States Archives at
Washington. But we have no means
of showing it to anyone ourselves.
A used 16 mm. sound projector
would be welcome. A new one costs
$500.
     Yes, things do wear out. There is 
the mimeograph machine. After 
years of hard service it still grinds
out copy - but for sure we think it is
on its last legs. A new, modern duplicating 
machine is one of our important
needs.
     People wear out too. An auto
wreck and several illnesses have
taken a heavy toll of time and energy
from the staff this winter. Hospital
and doctor bills still remain to be 
settled.
     Then there is the plumbing. What
the frigid weather did to our plant
... but we won't go into the horrible 
details.
     Highlander must have funds immediately
to meet the costs of the 
Spring Term. We can continue our
work only if everyone who is interested
in what we do will contribute
every dollar possible to the support 
of the school.
