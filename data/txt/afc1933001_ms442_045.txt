Go Down, Old Hannah*

"If the world is gonna be as hot and hellish to[m]morr[o]ow 
as it is today," [crys] cries the weary, sweating Negro
convict, "Let the sun do down and [never] rise [again] no more 'til Judgement Day."
This [slow] mournful field-song of the Texas prison system is surely 
one of the finest of American indigenous folk-songs. The
melody drags on like [the] one "of [them] dem long, hot summer days
in July and August when "[?] three o'clock in de ev'nin' the sun jus' stops an' won't more on."  The text speaks tersely of the tragedy
[of the next] of nineteen-ten, when convicts were dying of 
sunstroke or [under the shotgu] from buck-shot wounds as
they made [a] desperate breaks away from misery too great for
them to bear.

How better could [the] any poet tell the horror of prison, the relentless, machinelike institution,
than this communal song?  when----
  "Ef a man don' know, ef a man don' know-----
   It's a man lyin' dead on de low turn-row."
L.B. [brings] who was never bothered by the heat or the hard
work, has injected his personality into the song,
  "Number one leader, I was rollin' some,**
   I [was] wuz [workin'] rollin', baby, from sun to sun."
He sings only the leader's part of a song that is nearly
always sung by a leader and a group and his melody is
quite different from that current nowadays in the Texas
prison camps. He cares little for this holler.
