They was an old preacher in the pulpit, see, and
his old deacons had faith in this preacher--anything he said,
why they all tried to do it. So he was up in the pulpit preaching
and he says,

Aa--ah, ladies and gentlemen-ah,
Now they's nothin in this world
Nothin that I've run up [against] on yit
That's better to me-ah
Than a good oldtimereligion. . .
I-I8ve had money-ah
And I  own a car-ah,
And I've got my own buildin-ah
And I[â€˜ve] got everything I need-ah,
But I never found nothin yit on earth, to me
As good as a good old time religion-ah.

Now if anybody here
In the church,
Anywhere around-ah
Can get up now
And tell me anything
Is better to them
Than a good oldtime religion,
Git up now and speak.

So they had an old brother, you know, was settin way
back there in the back of the church and he went to git up, see.
So , whe he got to his feet, this preacher looked down there
and seed him, he says, "Listen, John, [I'll kill you] if up get up here in this church tonight and
name  what I know you thinkin about!"
