W.B. :
     I've seen it!  I had walked this levee right
here.  I left Greenville -this town- right here -on top of
this levee- on a Sunday evening at three o'clock.  And I
walked from here to my house and I didn't get there till four
o'clock that day next morning.   That's when they was cuttin
that field as (same as I?).  I didn't catch a ride -didn't
have no money for to pay nobody.  And the man let stayed on
the boat two days.  Mr. Sandy (Armstrong?).  You know, people
that's been here a few years --I guess that's why God didn't
kill 'em all, he left somebody here to tell the story.  Now
you see this levee here?, I sodded this levee.  What I mean
about sodding it?

     Well this levee here, I sodded this levee.
After they got five sections done, which is five hundred feet,
I sodded this levee, I planted the grass on this levee, I had
the contract.  Ah. . planting the grass. . on this levee.  I made
a little money out of it.  Then, I left here, I went down to
the front, where there used to be the headquarters.  (Used
to be?) number three.  I cooked, I waited tables, and I was a
(taxi-tender?).  26th and queue 17.  Right here.
