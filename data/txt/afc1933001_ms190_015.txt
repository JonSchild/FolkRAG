Mr. William C. Haygood
February 8, 1943

     Stetson Kennedy, whose plan you sent me for review
a few days ago can be of great help to me in gathering
wartime folklore. 
     
     The records, song-manuscripts, etc. gathered by all
these individuals should be filed permanently in the Archive
of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Benjamin
Botkin, of the Archive of American Folk Song, could be of
great help in advising these fellows and the library could
and, doubtless, will be able to offer assistance in other ways.

     I am returning to you, herewith, the fellowship forms
which you were kind enough to give me some months ago. I shall
use these names during the year as sources of information.
Enclosed also is a file of material on a Mr. James Pipes, sent 
to me by Henry Allen Moe of Guggenheim. I thought perhaps you
would be interested in looking it over. When you have finished 
it, would you be so kind as to forward it on to Mr. Moe.

     If you should like to have additional information on
the projects I have covered in my letter, let me know. I hope 
they meet with favorable consideration of yourself and your
Board.

     Thanking you for your many courtesies, I am,

     Sincerely yours,     

     Alan Lomax
     Division of Educational Services

P.S. Copies of this letter have been sent to Archibald MacLeish
and Lyman Bryson, and I presume you will hear from one or
both of them.
