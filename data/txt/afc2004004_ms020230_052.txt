day there work ta do, ya see, you will do it.  'Cause there's
no Sunday, you [kono] know?  An'. . .
TL:     There isn't any Sunday?
BJ:     No. Ah, they is, ah, what, what I mean about the work proposition
. . .Now, you can knock off.  An' you can not go.  But if
you want[s] to, you can go ta work.  See?  The field's jus' as full
a peoples on, on Sunday as it is on a, on a Monday, ya see?
Mean, if, if, if they wanna go.  An' there a lot of folks work all
day an' go to church that night.  Ya see?  Ah, plen'y of 'em.
Because it's like this:  If you got a big farm, a bean farm
especially, ya see?, ah, if that bean is ready to pick today,
it's ready today.  You see?  An' so, that, that, that's the way it
is; it has ta be picked today.  An' tomorra, why, they won't be 
choice beans.  Ya see.  They, ah, 'cause a bean grows overnight, 
ya see.  An' everything else, quite natchul, that grow on the
earth, [an'] ah, in the earth, however.  Ah, they grows an' dey, they
ah, grows at night, ya see.  Well ya see, tomorra mornin', dem bottom
beans or sumpin' like that, would be a little too hard, an' 
they you have to -- An' then the man wants his money out the
beans, what he done put in it, ya know?  An' he got to pay to have
'em picked.   If he have 'em picked choicey, when the bean buyers
come out to look at the beans, why, they'll be choice, choice
beans.  See?  An' if they [doin] don't, why, they can feel em'm an'
break 'em an' tell that they a lil' overgrowed, see?   Well, you can
sell 'em, but ya won't git the price that you would have got for
the choice beans.
TL:     Well, isn't there sumpin' goin' on all the time, then?
BJ:     Yes, all the time.
