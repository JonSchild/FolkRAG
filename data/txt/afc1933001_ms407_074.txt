Adventure-Chicago         2

But I found little happiness in the money-grubbing toil of State Street.  The 
excited barkings of brokers in the Stock and Grain Exchanges where I sometimes loitered
[sounded like] resembled the yapping of coyotes. I had little sympathy for this sort of warfare. 
My life seemed drab and desolate. The streets were colt, inhospitable. On the corners
the policeman's whistle in the murky, wintry darkness sounded like the cry of screech
owls, dismal and forbidding. At times even now I seem to hear those shrill whistles and
my heart [turns cold again] again turns cold.
For me Chicago held one bright spot- the home of Tom Peete Cross, one time fellow
student Harvard, a Virginian with a lovely wife and two lovelier daughters. As a 
student of Irish literature he knew ballads and folk songs scientifically. He cheered me
on in my work as a collector. Almost every year we had met at the annual sessions of the 
Modern Language Association where a group of like minds would [meet and] sing together some of my latest finds. Through Tom Peete Cross I met Lloyd Lewis, [Charley] Alfred MacArthur and Carl Sandburg. These four men changed the color of my exist4nss as a high financier. Their 
friendship and sympathetic attitude kept alive my interest in folk stuff, even amidst the
deadening influence of the stock ticker. We met informally now and then and swapped songs.
Carl Sandburg came out to seeme on a holiday, taking away with him the "Letters
of Harry Peyton Steger", [Harry Steger was my] friend and class-mate of University days,
the literary executor of O.Henry. Few know that the "H.P.S." signed to the Introduction
of the thirteenth and last volume of the definitive edition of O.Henry are the initials of
that inimitable and eternally lovely boy, Harry Peyton Steger. Carl Sandburg possesses a rare, unerring, instinctive 
feeling for the genuine ballad. When we remember that he has spent much of his life
pounding pavements looking for new items, it is remarkable that the first large collection
of folk songs, his The American SongBag, contains so few examples of cheap tin-pan alley
maunderings. He loves simple folk and his instinct for their genuine product is uncanny.
