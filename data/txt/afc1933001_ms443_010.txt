Yes, I got up this mornin', got up so doggone soon,
Yes, I got up this mornin', got up so doggone soon,
Yes, I couldn' see nothin', honey, but de stars an' moon,
When I was on Angola, I made [up] this song--we had to get up so
soon at three-thirty an' three o'clock in de mornin' ----
When [I] they cuttin' cane, I'd get up so soon--when I'd walk outdo's I
couldn' see a thing but the stars shinin'---I 'gin [to] sit down an' 'gin to think about my happy
home----an' I couldn' lay back down in my bed ----
Yes, I got up this mornin' an' I could not lay back down,
Yes, I got up this mornin' an' I could not lay back down,
Thinkin' 'bout my baby, livin' in Taylortown.
Spoken:
An' I know someday the sun gonna shine in my do' some day----
an' I knowed someday when I leave here it wouldn' be happen
no mo'----
Sung:
The sun gonna shine in my [back]-do' some day,
The sun gonna shine [in] my back-do' some day,
Goin' back North Lou's'ana, goin' back there to stay.
Spoken:
An' I knows when I got a-loose from here--I wouldn' come back
no mo'----
Sung:
I leave here walkin', hang crepe on de do',
When I Ieave here walkin', hang crepe on de do',
I may not be dead but ain' comin' back here no mo'.
Spoken:
I had a lot to tell my sweetheart when I git back home----
