October 7, 1937 

Mr. Alan Lomax 
General Delivery 
Hyden, Kentucky 

Dear Alan, 
Will you please make up a summary of your work from 
July 1, 1936 to July 1, 1937 for inclusion in the annual 
report. Something like your letter from the Bahamas, published 
in the previous report, will do. Father is working 
on his part. Try to arrange it so that you will not report 
your work this summer which rightfully should go in next 
year's report. 
I'm sorry that I have to bother you about this but circumstances
force me to. 
Sincerely, 

HS
mr
