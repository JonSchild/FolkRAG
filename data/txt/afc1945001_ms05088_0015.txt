An executive of the Automotive Council of War Production
heard August 4 that "the United Nations are planning to open up a second
front by attacking the French coast at a number of points with amphibian
tanks.  Only one of these points will be the place where they will
actually make the front but the Germans will not know, of course, what
the real pattern is."  Michigan 9 (Aug 3-8)
