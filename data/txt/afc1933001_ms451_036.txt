J.B. MARCUM*
It was on the fourth of May half past eight o'clock that
day
J. B. Marcum he was standing in the door
In the court house of the town where Curt Jett was lurking
round
To get a chance to lay him on the floor
Thomas White, a friend of Jett's, no worse man was ever met
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He came walking boldly through the courthouse hall
As he went passing by, he looked Marcum in the eye
Knowing truly that poor Marcum soon would fall.
Jett's blood was running hot when he fired the vital shot
Took Marcum from his family so brave
Curtis Jett walked through the hall with his pistol, lead
and ball
Knowing he had sent poor Marcum to his grave.
Chorus: 
J.B Marcum leaves his wife to morn all her life
And her little children stand it well and brace
But that little friend of Jett's, Thomas White, a friend
of Jett's
Were the man that laid poor Marcum in his grave
Justice Hargis and his friend, Sheriff Edward Callahan,
Were across the street in Hargis' brother's store
Some believe they knew the plot and were listening for the
shot
And to see Jett's victim fall there in the floor.
Captain Ewing standing there saw him fall and heard him cry
"Oh lord, they have killed me at last."
Ewing saw the man and the gun and hastily he run
But he heard the second loud and awful blast. Chorus.
Dwing knew the secret well, but he was afraid to tell
For he knew that they would kill him then and there
He kept the secret xxxxx then till they arrested both the
men
And locked them up within the County jail. Chorus
They arrested White and Jett and in Jackson Court they met
And the court labored on with all its might but the jury
disagreed
Just one man began to plead that he thought White and Jett
should go free.
