as a service to the State Director in each 
state.  This will be another instance of
the elimination of duplication.

ENTERTAINMENT MATERIAL
Preparation and compilation of 
entertainment and recreation material will be
under the direction of the Service 
Director.  This material will consist of plays,
dialogs, pageants and readings of interest
to members, having educational value
for the furtherance of the cooperative 
movement.

MATERIAL FOR SALE
The Education Service is not a 
merchandise mart.  But it will carry in stock
the pamphlets which are most in demand
by the membership, as a service to the
membership and as a service to the state
organizations who will not then be under
the necessity of typing up a considerable
sum of money in pamphlets and charts
for use of teacher and Local Leaders.
