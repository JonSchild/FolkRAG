On February 12, according to the instructions from my chief, I went to the University
of Florida for the meeting of the Southern Folk Lore Society. There I read a paper
on the documentary record as an aid to folklore research and another paper on the
ideology of folklore research and participated in a panel on folklore method.
These papers were well received and I was able to assist in planning the year's
activity of the Society through the good offices of the newly-elected president,
a close friend of mine, Mr. Fletcher Collins.
Respectfully submitted,
