Reverend Roe.  Reel 3.  P.2
was born the Christ and that Christ, He set up his kingdom in the 
world, and His kingdom was made up of all of those that we could get
out of those different nations that He had scattered. And those who
make up the church must be one -- the Bible teaches that -- it's a
spiritual house and all of us is material in that building. That's all. 
If we aren't united, well, it ouwld be like two bricks laid on top of 
eachother with no morter to hold them together. It takes love. Without
love, there can be no spiritual building.
A: When did you find thatout, Reverend?
R: Well, (laughter), ,
A. When did this feeling come down? I mean, when did you really 
realize it?
R: Well, from praying and reading the Word. I laid on my back - I
didn't have lamps, didn't have no lights then. I'd get pine knots
and I'd put my pine knot in the fire, right out on my back, you know,
and hold that book up, you know, so the light would shine up against
it, that's the way I studied my Bible. For many a night I lay there
until the cicken would be crawing for day. I'd read that Bible, and 
then I found this: a man didn't learn so much studying, I mean reading,
the Bible, he had to study it, and I began then to go back and study
and study and study. And, you know, of course, I hadno  teacher to
teach me; I just had to pray, and I know things come to me that I didn't
know, and they come from somewhere; it must have come from God -- no
other source which could have come but from God. I believe this: I read
how God promise the Holy Spirit, and it said that He would bring all 
things new to your memory, whatever I have said unto you. Tha's what
He said this Holy Spirit would do to the Disciples.
Well, then I realized I had to make God talk to me in His Word, because
I believe when I read His Word it's just God preaching to me.
And then when I get into a pulpit He promised to bring it back to me.
