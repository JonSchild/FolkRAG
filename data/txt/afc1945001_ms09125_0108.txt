I heard that despite radio announcements and newspaper
articles, clothes will be rationed near the end of April and
that the fact that there is a good supply of clothes 
and material is just to keep people from hoarding

A woman walked into the store and bought 10 lbs of
butter :on leaving she said, "I just wanted to
get a little butter before these hoarders get busy."
