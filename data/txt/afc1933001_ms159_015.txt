Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Numerous people have been making a lot of "blind dates"
for you and we think you should meet them so that they may be in a
position really to tell people about you.

EDNA GIESEN, MARGARET RICHARDSON and PHIL TIPPIN are, undoubtedly,
names you have seen on the back of your circulars. They
are very real people and so we have arranged a little get-together
for Friday, July 26th, at 4:30 P.M. so that you can meet them. You
will also enjoy renewing acquaintances with other friends on our roster
and meeting new personalities whom you want to know.

The party will be held at the NEW WESTON HOTEL, Madison
Avenue, New York, in suite 311.

Do come and let us have a grand summer get-together.

We shall look for you.

Do let us know so that we may make plans which will insure 
your having good food, as well as good fellowship.

Sincerely yours,
Isabel R. Scott
