Substantially the same remark was heard Friday, August 7, at a
service station in Columbia where a man was waiting to be served.  This
man, a middle-aged man dressed in over-alls and apparently from the rural
areas, said that a friend of his "was able to get all the gasoline he
wants, while I am waiting here to get just four gallons."  He added,
"I'm going to see this friend of mine tonight and get him to put me in
touch with this fellow that has plenty of gasoline to sell."
