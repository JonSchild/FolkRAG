2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 3. p. 2

Look-a Yonder

Sometimes weary,
Got on his shoes, Lawd,
Sometimes cryin'
With his travelin' shoes, Lawd,
Sometimes moanin',
Travelin' shoes, Lawd,
Sometimes groanin',
Travelin' shoes, Lawd,
I see my mother, Lawd,
Travelin' shoes, Lawd,
Walkin' down, Lawd,
Travelin' shoes, she
Sometimes cryin',
Travelin' shoes, Lawd,  (2)
Weepin',
Travelin' shoes, Lawd.  (2)

Look-a yonder,   (2)
I see my sister
Come walkin' down,
Lawd, she got on her travelin',
I mean her shoes, Lawd,
Got on her travelin',
I mean shoes, chile,
Got on her travelin',
I mean shoes, Lawd,
She was weepin',
With her shoes, Lawd,
She was moanin',
With her shoes, Lawd
