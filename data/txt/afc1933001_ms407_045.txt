Negro spirituals.

Once while speaking before the students of
Oberlin College in [speaking of the] referring to
Negro humour, even in his spirituals I quoted a couple
of stanzas I had heard sung
in a small wayside church
among the big cotton plantations
of the Brazos bottom in Texas:
"Methodist preacher, you are dead,
You poured water on the baby's head;
Baptist preacher you are right,
Case you take them candidates out
o'sight.
=
I went to the river to be baptized,
I stepped on a root and I got
capsized,
The water was deep and the preacher was weak
So the nigger went to heaven from the bottom of the creek.
