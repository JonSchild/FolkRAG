Dear Miss Bertram,
I am happy to know that you are interested in furthering
the Archive's work in Lewis County, and I was glad to hear
that you know of two definite informants. Are these two individuals
whom you refer to, singers, mountain people?
Would you be interested in planning a county folk-singing
contest to stimulate interest in the preservation and use of the
ballads and songs that are the South's richest literary heritage?
I imagine that such a contest would not be difficult to arrange
and it could culminate in my arrival with my recording machine
with which I would make records the best songs.
If the Board of Education would be interested in sponsoring
an affair of this kind, it will have ample time to arrange it.
I shall not reach Northern Kentucky before the last of October.
I should like to hear from you again in regard to this matter.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
