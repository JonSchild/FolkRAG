NON-PLANTATION COTTON AREA

Madison County, Alabama

Lying between the Tennessee River and the border of the State
of Tennessee, Madison County is in the tier of upper Alabama counties
referred to as "white" counties. This distinguishes these counties
sharply from those in lower Alabama where Negroes form the bulk of the
population. In 1930 Negroes were only 29.8 per cent of the population in
Madison County as contrasted with 80 and 90 per cent of the populations of
some counties in lower Alabama. This type of area represents the non-plantation
cotton belt, and a sphere of active economic competition between white
and Negro rural workers. It is poorer country for farming, but lacking the
domination of the plantation system it has been more receptive to industry.
The mills that have sprung up in the town of Huntsville have, however, been
designed primarily for the landless and impoverished whites. *]End*

The People

Madison county was one of the first areas of Alabama to be settled,
and Huntsville was the first capital of the state. In 1890 it was one of
the most densely populated rural counties in the state. Between 1890 and
1930 the population of the county increased only 69.5 per cent, while the
population of Alabama increased 74.9 per cent. Between 1920 and 1930, however,
this situation was reversed, the county population increasing 26.0 per 
cent while the state increased only 12.7 per cent. Population density in
1930 was relatively high, being 79.7 per square mile.

*Begin[* While the total population of the county has increased since 1930,
the Negro population has remained constant except for minor fluctuations.
In 1890 the Negro and white populations were practically equal. By 1930
