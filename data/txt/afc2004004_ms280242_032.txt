TAPE 89 E - DAVY STEWART.
Maggie the MilkMaid:
1) Maggie was milking one fine day in May,
When down come young Jockie, these words he did say.
"Maggie, O Maggie, your milk is running free,
If I sit down beside ye, would you milk me?"
A-tooral-i-laddie,
A-tooral-i-aye.
2) The lassie lay down and she pulled up her clothes,
He gaed her the length that ye may well suppose.
He gaed her the length, it made poor Maggie cry,
So come doon to the hielands to milk the dry kye.
3) The lassie was up and she put on her clothes,
And unto her mother she did suppose,
"O mother, o mother, it's no me to blame,
I've milked young Johnny and I'll milk him again.
4) "O daughter, o daughter, you're grievous to blame,
Oftimes I told you to beware of young men.
There's he goat and she-goats and goats of all kind,
But there's no very good milk when the bull lies behind.

I just learnt it off ploughman boys as I was going round the farms.
Years ago. . .walking across the stubbly fields.

This song is a great ploughman's song in the midlands of Scotland.
The Laird of the Dentidoonbye.
1) A lassie was herding her father's kye,
A gentleman on horseback, he come riding by,
A gentleman on horseback, he come riding by,
He was the Laird of the Dentidoonbye.
2) "O bonnie lassie what would you dee
If I was to lie this night with thee?"
"To lie with me that'll never, never be,
Though you're Laird of the Dentidoonbye."
3) For he took her by the middle so small,
And laid her down where the grass grows long,
A long, long time ere he rose her up again,
She was Lady of the Dentidoonbye.
4) It happened on a fine summer's day,
The lassie's father had some money to pay,
The lassie's father had some money to pay
To the Laird of the Dentidoonbye.
