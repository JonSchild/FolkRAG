      Becky-Dean-- the Gamblin' Girl 
   (Each couplet is [repeated] sung twice.) 
[*first 
verse*]
Sung: 
Becky Dean, she was a gamblin' gal, 
She winned the money an' she winned it fair. 

Becky Dean had her games on the ground, 
She wi[ned]s all the money [that] the skinners laid down.

Spoken: 
Now this here will be the two step--- 
Sung: 
She started to hit one wid a single tree, 
You might a heerd the rascal holl'in', "Doncha murder me."  

Becky Dean walked all the way from East St. Louis,
When she didn' have but the one thin dime. 

Spoken: 
Now I'm goin' to change it up into a cakewalk---
Sung: 
Didn' spen' it for whiskey, honey, an' neither for wine, 
She spent it all on the sake of de man of mine. 
but It's Miss Becky Dean, honey all over dis worl', 
An' Becky Dean, she's a gamblin' girl. 

Wage hands - gamblers - wd talk about Becky 
Dean - heard them singin' [sm?] few words & put 
it in there myself --
