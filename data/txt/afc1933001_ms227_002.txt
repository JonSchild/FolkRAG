JOHN A. LOMAX
7456 SAN BENITO WAY
DALLAS, TEXAS
5/4/1940.

Dear Alan:

Again I'll have to hand it to
you. You were able to take it
squarely on your exposed and
[merited] guilty chin and then come back
without justifiable rancor and
gracefully absorb the blow as
though you were only a dutiful
son of tender years. I congratulated
you heartily and I am still more
proud of you.

During 1939 you income
was larger than I was
able to earn until I came to
Dallas. Let me add this now,
not through any right but only
because you ought to [kno] benefit
