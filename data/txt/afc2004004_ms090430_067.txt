busses. In 1937 the State School Commission was organized and the North Carolina
schools were taken from local supervision and placed under the control of
the central state body. This was found necessary for many of the local units
were unable to meet their obligations and pay the teachers. This was not
true of Johnston County, where throughout the more severe periods of the depression
teachers received full and prompt payment.

The per capita expenditures for white children for teachers' salaries
in the county are $21.21, and for Negro children $14.04. In 1938 there
were 4,179 pupils enrolled in the elementary and high schools. The high
schools are just developing. In 1925 there were 167 and in 1938 there were
395 students enrolled in the high schools, with fifteen teachers.

The Johnston County Training School at Smithfield is an enterprising
venture in rural education and social work. It is a modern three-story
brick building, erected in 1922, and combines elementary and high school work,
with 201 high school and 566 elementary school children attending. The Richard
B. Harrison High School at Selma has 957 pupils, with only about 150 enrolled
in the high school. The Clayton High School has 767 elementary pupils and a
negligible number of high school students.

The schools in Johnston County have a teaching staff perhaps as unorthodox
as other features of the educational system. In the Smithfield school
the records of thirteen teachers show that seven are native North Carolinians,
of which two were born in Johnston County. Others were natives of Connecticut,
New Jersey, Georgia, and Mississippi. The records of eleven Selma teachers
show ten were native North Carolinians and the other was a native of New York.
Seven Clayton teachers were North Carolinians and the other a Virginian. At
