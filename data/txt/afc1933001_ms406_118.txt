By virtue of their discovery and possession, as well as
under their rights secured by the Hartford Treaty, 
the territory now contained in the counties of Kings 
and Queens belonged to and was held by the Dutch settlers
until 1664, and hence it was the Hollanders that founded the
city of Brooklyn. The original name given to this settlement
was Breuckelen, which, in Dutch language, signifies marsh
land. Before the present 
name of Brooklyn
was evolved by the
more modern day
scholars and experts
in refined fastidity, the
town was knows as
Bruyklandt Brukland,
Brocklandt and Brookland. 
This city is renowned 
throughout
the country as one of 
homes and churches,
where the evils of 
gambling and other
sns, which beset New
York and other large 
cities are not tolerated, 
and anything of
a more sporty nature 
than church fairs and
horse back riding are frowned upon. This assumed virtue
on the part of the good people on the other side
of the East River is hardly consistent with the history of
events, which resulted in making it the splendid municipality
it has grown to be. It will perhaps shock and be news to 
many residents of the "City of Brotherly Love" to know that
the first Episcopal church erected in Brooklyn was commenced
by funds raised by a lottery, yet history so records the fact.
In Rivington's Gazette of March 17, 1774, appears the following 
notice: "Scheme of a lottery for raising the sum of 
 Â£600 to build a church at Brooklyn Ferry under the patronage 
of the rector and vestry of Trinity Church, there being no
place in Kings County for the public worship of Almighty God,
where the English liturgy is used, and the inhabitants in communion 
with the Church
of England, having 
long submitted to great
inconvenience from inclemency 
of the weather 
and other causes,
intreat the assistance 
of the public in promoting 
their laudable
method of raising a 
sufficient sum for
erecting a decent building 
for the service of 
Almighty God. The 
lottery to consist of
4,000 tickets subject to
a deduction of fifteen
per cent." There were 
1,332 prizes and 2,668
blanks. As the cash
prizes to be distributed
among the holders of the winning tickets aggregated $10,000, 
the tickets must have sold for about a guinea
each, to net the church the $3,000 required, and defray the
expenses of this "laudable method." How many tickets were
sold and how much cash was actually realized by this gambling
scheme, history fails to record. The construction of this
church (St. Anne's) was interrupted by the Revolutionary
