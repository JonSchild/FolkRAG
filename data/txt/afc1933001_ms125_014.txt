Dear Miss McGill,
    Thank you for your kind letter. I am sorry to learn that you
will not be in Kentucky during my stay here and I greatly appreciate 
the addresses you have given me. Perhaps you might be able
to come for a visit to the Archive after I return to Washington
November first. I should be delighted to see you.

    Sincerely yours,

    Alan Lomax
