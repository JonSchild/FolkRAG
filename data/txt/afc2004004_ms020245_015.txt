MY GOD IS A ROCK

CHORUS:
My God is a rock
In the weary land,
Weary land,
Oh, weary land,
My God is a rock
In the weary land,
Shelter in the time of storm.

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Now, go 'way, you long-tongued liar,
We don't need you in this band,
We don't want nothin' but true born souls,
Been washed in the blood of the lamb.  (CHORUS)

Well, stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter One,
The Lord God's work was just begun,
Stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Two,
When Jesus preached among the Jews,
Stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Three,
Jesus died out on Calvary.

CHORUS:
And I know he's a rock, etc.

Yes, stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Four,
Jesus preached among the poor,
Stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Five,
When Jesus brought that dead to live,
An' stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Six,
He went in Jerusalem and healed the sick.

CHORUS:
And I know he's a rock, etc.

Yes, stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Seven,
When Jesus died and he went to Heaven,
And stop, and let me tell you 'bout Chapter Eight,
When Jesus opened them Gospel gates,
And stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Nine,
When Jesus turned the water to wine,
And stop, an' let me tell you 'bout Chapter Ten,
John saw him comin' in the world again.

CHORUS:
And I know he's a rock, etc.

Yes, he is the Lily of the Valley, 
He is the bright and the Mornin' Star,
When they put ol' Daniel in the lion's den,
Jesus locked the lion's jaws.

CHORUS:
Now, I know he's a rock, etc.

(REPEAT CHORUS AS FIRST TIME)
