REGISTER OF CIRCUIT COURT, In Equity
SUMTER COUNTY
LIVINGSTON, ALABAMA

Nov., 3/41

Dear Mr. Lomax;-

In Alan's first letter to me he suggested we begin recording
September 15th and I agreed. Later he said there had been some delay
and he wondered if October 15th would be too late, or if we should wait until
spring. At that time I wrote him, sending you a copy of the letter, that
October 15th was late due to all rains and bad roads in this section and
that in all probability we'd miss some country congregatinal singing which
you wanted very much to get and that I thought spring would be safest.

Your letter several days ago Suggesting November 15th through
January 15th is the first letter I've had since from either of you.

Now you both know your negro and I dare not suggest to such
authorities, but I've never yet been able to get anything out of one in
cold weather and while we may have pretty days for a week or more, we
are certainly due a lot of very disagreeable ones very soon. I think it
would be a waste of money for the Library of Congress to pay me for two
months of recording in the country beginning November 15th and I am
unwilling to make the poor showing which I feel would be inevitable.

The machine could not be set up in their small dark houses and my
small apartment could not possibly take care of several singers, the
machine and a microphone.

I am disappointed not to be able to do the work at this time, not
only because I'd looked forward to it and to being again with you and
Miss T, but because I really need the work desperately. The W.P.A. job did
not materialize as I'd expected and the last check was June 30th.

I hope very much you and Alan will understand and see this just
as I do. I have talked with Pratt and those who know conditions here and
all agree this is no time to arrange for daily recording through January.

With best wishes for you both,
Devotedly,
Ruby P. Tartt

Dear Alan

Have lost Mr. S's letter. Can't spell
the name, but if he lets your father write his
letters to me perhaps he'll be kind enough to
let you relay this to him -
Love to Elizabeth too -
R.P.T.
