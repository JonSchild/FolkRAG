DEATH HAS NO MERCH IN THIS LAND.


Leave you standing on the highway crying, in this land.
Oh Death will leave you standing on the highway crying 
in this land.
Well he'll come to your house and won't stay long,
Look in your bed and you find somebody gone.

Death take the last thing from your, Oh Lord, in this
land.
Oh death never takes no vacation in this land.
Oh Death don't never take no vacation in this land.
Well, he come to your house and he won't stay long,
You look in the bed and you find somebody gone.
Death'll never take no vacation in this land.
