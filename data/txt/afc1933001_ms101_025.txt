August 25 1947
Dear John Lomax:
I am very glad of the opportunity offered me by old friends of ours in Texas to add my name to the many who will be sending you congratulations on the occasion of your 80th birthday. As final custodian of the many hundreds of records made by you for the Archive of American Folk Song, I am daily made aware of their value to the cultural history of the United States. Your work was a basic contribution to this important aspect of the Library of Congress' activity. Requests for information about the records and for duplicates of them come to us not only from all States in the Union, but from all corners of the earth as well. Your 80th birthday is a matter, then, not only of unalloyed pleasure to your friends but of general interest to the many who know of you and your work. I extend my heartiest congratulations to you, our Honorary Curator of the Archive of American Folk Song, a fellow Texas, and a friend.
Sincerely yours,
Luther H. Evans
Library of Congress
