and you   to send my salary.
Yesterday when I did not hear
from you I countermanded 
the last Ironwood order and 
asked him to forward my 
mail.  This he did -- and this 
morning I received all of 
it -- all but the advance --
  and I suppose he is now so 
confused he is afraid to let 
 it go.  So I'm in debt here 
and can't leave unless 
I get a favorable response 
to today's appeal to you.
