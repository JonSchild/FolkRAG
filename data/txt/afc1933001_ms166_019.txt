Lord Lovell was laid in the church's apse
Lady [Lovell] Nancy was laid in the choir
And out of her bosom there grew a red rose
And out of her lover's, a briar, i - iar.
And out of her lover's, a briar.

And they grew and they grew, to the Church 
steeple's top.
Until they could grow no higher.
And there they entwined in a true
lover's knot,
For all true lovers to admire,
i-ire
For all true lovers to admire.
