Ballad of a Lumberjack

By A. Lindquist, Triangle 40

Some Jacks of old will still uphold
Those "Grand Old Days" of yore,
And how with steers they logged for years
Way back on Bay Shalore.
Them were the days the loggers say
When the crews would earn their pay
They'd log by moonlight on the bog
Those Jacks of yesterday.

Such were the ways of bygone days
Those grand old times are past.
The twelve hour day, starvation pay
We're glad they could not last.
We shed no tears for yesteryears
Goodbye to Bay Shalore!
Farewell to you old moonlight crew
We want you back no more!

We've had some fights, we've won some rights
We are gaining as we go
We march along, ten thousand strong
With the mighty C.I.O.
We'll fight again, it's not in vain,
We'll go to any length
And organize at any price
In unity is strength.

And now we greet our local sheet
Exploiters now beware!
For well we know that earthly foe
With pen cannot compare.
And all the while the rank and file
Will back your every line!
Go strike your blow, for the C.I.O.
And Local twenty-nine!
