I The other day I passed two women who were 
discussing the war. One said that she did not 
care who won the war, because conditions couldn't
be any worse than they are now. The other 
lady said, "at least we can then be with white
men without being arrested. They tell me Germans 
do those things."

II There was a fight on the street car a good 
while ago between a colored an white man. As
usual, all of the blame was placed on the 
colored man. Later on, This man was 
heard to say: "I wish Hitler would come over here
and kill up every damned white man. We don't 
have to worry because we couldn't be any worse off. 
We are slaves [[nearly]] now - we will be slaves then.

III A white lady said: "If Hitler does come over, 
we won't have to worry about how these
black niggers in the way any more. In a way
I wish Hitler and the Japs would win.
