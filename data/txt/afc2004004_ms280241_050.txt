22) Lord Fyvie's lands are broad and long,
And they are wondrous bonnie,
But I wouldna gie my ain true love
For all your lands in Fyvie.
Lomax: Men you sang that song at the campfires in the old days,
did people weep?
Jean: Well - it was a song that we sung long afront of my time.
Yes - lots of people that's a very sensitive natured. Some
people they came help feeling a bit sad when they hear a sad song.
But that's not all the song. That's about half. She dies there, and 
Andrew Lammie came home from Edinburgh town, and when her mother
said to her "O Annie dear, O Annie dear, I hear your cowie lowin". . . . .
she was lying dying -- it was Andrew Lammie blowing his trumpet,
and it was heard at the mill of Tuftie, and she was lying dying.
     So her mother heard the trumpet blowing; he was away and was
letting her know he was home. But he didn't know that she was
lying dying. So he blew her trumpet to let her know that he was
back home. So her mother heard and she said, "O Annie dear, O
Annie dear, I hear your cowie lowin" - well, that was his
trumpet, and she said, "I wouldna gie that cowi low for all your
kye i n Fyvie." Well, she died.
Lomax: Is that the part you left out?
Jean: No - of course - there's a lot more to come about Lord
Fyvie coming past and he did see her lying dying - and he was also
broken-hearted because he did love her, Lord Fyvie did, -- and
he said, "The fairest flower was cut down by hin that ever sprung
in Fyvie." Because he wanted her, but she didn't want him - that
she was killed, and of course, his own trumpeter Andrew Lammie
was his rival for her.
Lomax: And their ghosts are still seen aren't they?
Jean: Well, they say so. - at the place where they'd always
been away a-meeting, "up and down in Tifty's Glen where the burn
runs clear and bonnie," I often went to meet my love, my ain true
Andrew Lammie." Well, long, long ago I've heard old people saying
that there was something there, and they always said it was.
Lomax: It seems like the worse thing people can do is to cross
true lovers.
Jean: Yes it is. It's a sin. If people loves each other so much -
it's a terrible son. Because ye may finally in the long run
separate them, but ye only will break their hearts anyway. They'll
never be happy. It is a terrible sin.
Lomax: But in the old days, especially, lots of people tried it.
