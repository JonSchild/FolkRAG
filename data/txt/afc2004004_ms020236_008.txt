           An' one day we was in the Silver Moon.    An' we was
all havin' different kinds of drinks, ya know.    Wasn't no
whiskey, just different, you know, cold drinks.   You know, iced cream
[drinks] an' things.   So I and a girl -- that was Rosa -- with me,
an' so we was just sittin' there talkin' -- makin' funna people,
that was usual.   Jus' sittin' at the table by ourselves.   An' he
come in and got a milkshake an' come on sit right down at the
table where I was talkin' to Rosa, [an' me.]   He spoke to me when
he talked to Rosa an' everythin'.  That done me all the good in the world.  I
said, I dig this conversation.   See, I was glad she know about 'im.
They jis' talk about different people, an' laugh, an' talkin'.
He drank the milkshake an' lef'.   An' so.   Tha's all a that.  Ha, ha!
           I hear them talk of ball games.   Y'know, I don' like ball games,
ya know.   An' I hear them talk about ball games.  So Frank [could] was
gonna pitch.   He was a gr-eat pitcher.  Ya know, Frankie Drayton.
An' I hear talk he gonna pitch, I gonna go to that ball game.
So one day, he wasn't pitchin' -- he was battin' or sumpin --
I don' know what happen.   But anyhow, he was goin' or runnin' or
sumpin' an' he fell an' hurt his laig.   An' they had to take 'im
an' carry 'im -- or carry him off from the game, [the] to the
doctor.   But I ain't seen Frank no more, [no suh] since.  I know he
didn't die from it, or anything that close to it, 'cause I seen
him around places.  But tha's the only somebody that I seen I liked, I
declare,  An' I was telling another girl about it once; we wasn't
there then; we done moved.   She said, "Well, I'da stepped on his
toes!  [Yes, suh, I'da] I'da Done sumpin'; I'da got a (consort-concert:)
with 'im, I mean:"   I ain' said nothin'to 'im, at all, not
one word.
