Dear Helen,

It is a matter of great regret to me that your project is
still being delayed.  Off the record there appear to be
complications at the Library of Congress not in regard to your
particular project, but of a more general nature which are causing the
delay.  I feel sure however eventually you will get your machine
and records.  My successor in the Archives is Ben Botkin former
editor of Folksay, a very nice fellow who will do his best to speed
things up for you.  I am now working for OWI attempting to utilize
folk lore material for wartime education.  It looks like it's going
to be a lot of fun.

The Negro spirituals you have collected all seem to me genuine
folk songs, although of course they may have been brought to
Nova Scotia by means of printed books. They are definitely worth
collecting however if for no other reason than comparison with other
Negro music from other parts of the western hemisphere.  In a way I
envy you your opportunity to get better acquainted with one rich
folk lore region.  I am sort of spread around all over the map myself.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would jot down for me any
songs, anecdotes, sayings, etc. which have wartime content or interest.
This type of material is being studied here at my office and may well
be used later on.

With kindest regards and best wishes I am

Sincerely, your friend
