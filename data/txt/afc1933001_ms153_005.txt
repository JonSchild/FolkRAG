   Yesterday I received a very exciting letter from Bob
Condon.  He and two of my friends at the Board are driving to
the Coast.  They are going through Cleveland and will stay here
for a day or two. I'm eager to see them all.  I miss them all
a lot, in fact, more than I thought I could miss them.

   I've looked back at what I've written and am impressed
by all the "I's", one would think I'm a terribly egotistical person.
As a matter of fact, the purpose of this letter was to find out what
the Lomaxes are doing.  Will you be in these parts at any time in
the near future?  If you get within a hundred miles of Cleveland,
I won't ever forgive you if you don't get in touch with me.  The
address is 9003 Yale Ave., Cleveland and the phone number Potomac 1395.
If you have the time and the inclination, I am, of course, always
thrilled by letters.  However, I don't hope for too much from you,
I've accepted the fact that you both are the world's lousiest correspondents,
but I love you nonetheless.

As ever,

Marie [?Prince]

   P.S.  Elizabeth, if you get around to it, will you  mail
those amber beads to me, please?
