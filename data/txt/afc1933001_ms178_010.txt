Dear Miss Stierhem:

I was called back to Washington 
suddenly for a date at the White House,
and therefore did not stop in Virginia
to make records as I had planned. Thank 
you for your continued interest. I shall
be sure to let you know the next time I
am going collecting. 

Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
