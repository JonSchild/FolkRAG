Tell Them That
Mr. Telemacque
Chorus > Tell Them that < - - (Sung after every verse)
You are not a good man
You are not giving us water
Not giving us [rum] drink
You do not have anything
You are a poor man
Tell them, hi, oh
Adeline sick
Mr. Angelo
You do not have anything
You do not have cigarettes
Mr. Outoo
You are crying hunger
He wants a little water
He wants a piece of food
He wants rest
You (all) are not having anything
You all are too miserly
Tell them mama 
Adeline sick
Adeline, Adeline, ah
Tell them mama (or mother)
Tell them papa
Tell them, eh, them
Tell them, mama
Adeline sick
Adeline, mama
Since morning
I am here
I haven't drunk a "grog"
He has nothing
He hasn't got rum
He hasn't got water.
Pull the boat
What are you all doing 
Everybody answer
