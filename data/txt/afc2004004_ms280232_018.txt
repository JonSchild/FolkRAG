1) A highland lad my love was born
The lowland loons he held in scorn,
And he aye was faithful to his clan
My gallant, braw John Hieland man.
Sing hey, my braw John Hieland man,
"       ho,   "       "       "       "            "
There's no a lad in all the land
Can match wi' my John Hieland man.
That's the Burn's version - the older version is this. . . .
1) My love was born in Aberdeen,
The bonniest lad that ye e'er have seen,
But noo he makes my heart full sad,
He's ta'en the filed wi' his white cockade.
Chorus:
O he's a rantin', roving' blade,
O he's a brisk and a bonny lad,
Betide what may, my heart is glad
Tae see my lad in his white cockade.
2) I'll sell my rock and I'll sell my reel,
My rippling cane and my spinning wheel,
Tae bring my lad a tartan plaid
A braid sair dirk and a white cockade. (cho.)

And the song of Prince Charlie's day. . . .
1) The bonniest lad that e'er I saw,
Bonny laddie, hieland ladie,
Wore a plaid and gaed full braw,
Refrain:
On his head a bonnet blue,
Bonny laddie, hieland laddie,
His royal heart baith firm and true,
Bonny laddie, hieland laddi3.
2) Geordie sits in Charlie's chair,
De'l cock him gin he sit there,
Charlie yet shall mont? the floor,
Well ye ken it is his own.
3) Weary for the lowland loon,
Whatstole frae him his father's crown,
Blessings on the kilted clans
Wha fecht for him at Preston Plains.
4) If ye'll play me fair play,
O'er the hills we'll be today,
O'er the hills and far away. (2)
