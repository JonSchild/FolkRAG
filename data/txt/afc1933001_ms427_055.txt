AUNT DINAH'S QUILTING PARTY

1.     In the sky the bright stars glittered,
        On the bank the pale moon shone;
        And 'twas from Aunt Dinah's quilting party,
        I was seeing Nellie Home.

         CHORUS - I was seeing Nellie home,
                  I was seeing Nellie home;
                  And 'twas from Aunt Dinah's quilting party,
                  I was seeing Nellie home.

2.     On my arm a soft hand rested,
        Rested light as ocean foam;
        And 'twas from Aunt Dinah's quilting party,
        I was seeing Nellie home.

        CHORUS -

3.     On my lips a whisper trembled,
        Trembled till it dared to come;
        And 'twas from Aunt Dinah's quilting party,
        I was seeing Nellie home.

        CHORUS -

4.     On my life new hopes were dawning,
        And those hopes have liv'd and grown;
        And 'twas from Aunt Dinah's quilting party,
        I was seeing Nellie home.

OLD FOLKS AT HOME
'Way down upon de Swanee Ribber, Far, far away,
Dere's wha' my heart is turning ebber, Dere's wha' de old
                    folks stay.
All up and down de whole creation, Sadly I roam,
Still longin' for de old plantation, An' for de old folks
                     at home.

CHORUS-     All de world am sad and dreary Eb'ry-where I roam;
                      Oh! darkies, how my heart grows weary, Far from de
                                   old folks at home.

All roun' de little farm I wander'd, When I was young,
Den many happy days I squander'd, Many de songs I sung.
When I was playin' wid my brudder, Happy was I;
Oh! take me to my kind old mudder, Dere let me live and die.

CHORUS-

One little hut among de bushes, One dat I love,
Still sadly to my mem'ry rushes, No matter where I rove.
When Will I see de bees a hummin' All roun' de comb?
When will I hear de banjo tummin' Down in my good old home?

CHORUS-
