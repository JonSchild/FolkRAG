Hendrick, Kentucky.
Dear Mr. Walters:
Thank you for your fine text of "The Range of the 
Buffalo." This is a fine old song and only wish I 
could have recorded it from your singing.
I am sorry that I won't be able to do your recording 
for a week or ten days. I am simply snowed under with 
work but I will get to it with the first free moment.
Thank you for your kind invitation. There is nothing 
I would enjoy more than a visit with you, and perhaps 
I will be able to return to Kentucky for a short time 
next summer. You may expect to hear from me soon, and 
in the meantime if you think of any old time ballads 
the Archive will be only to happy to receive them.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
