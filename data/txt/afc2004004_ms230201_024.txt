If you was tired, you couldn' tell [him] 'em. You'd have to 
to keep on workin'...
Sib:  What would they say, of you tell him?
Natchez:  Maybe crack you 'cross the head with a stick or maybe
kill you---one of those things.  You just had to keep
on workin' whether you was tired or not.  You started
 to work when you can't see and you quit when you can't
  see, one of those things.  What they call---"from can
  to can't".  When you [can] just can see in the mornin' till
 can't see no more at night. 
 Now this man, Charley Hulen, would come out an' say--
 "Well, those fellas is tired,"  says, "Give 'em some
 rest...." I think he the guy, ain't he, that cut them
 sixteen hours down to eight hours a day?  So men would
 start workin' at some certain hour in the morning', like
 eight o'clock...
The Kid:    Right in his section he did..Otherwise he was the [baddest]
baddes' man down through there.  He was a sharp shooter
from Texas.  He could shoot like nobody's business, he
an' his son, both--Little Charley and Big Charley.
Natchez:  You didn't know what part of Texas [he] the old, original Charley Hulen was from, did you?
The Kid:    No, I didn' know, but I know he was an ex-cowboy and he
could really shoot.  So he and Little Charley didn't
like the way things were goin' on around there, so
they just came in and taken over[x] and that made it better.
It's still better down there now...
Natchez:   O yeah.  I was down there in forty an' it's a lot better.
