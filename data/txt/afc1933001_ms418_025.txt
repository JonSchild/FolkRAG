Mr. Green
Telephones

By LENA LEWIS

With a frown upon his brow, Mr.
Green called the Devil
On the telephone the other day.
Anyone could see he was worried,
For this is what he had to say:

"Hello," came Mr. Green's voice
faintly o'er the wire,
"Is the old Devil himself at home?
If so, just inform this is Mr. Green
That wants him on the phone."

The Devil himself answered "Hello"
He said, "Mr. Green, I'm surprised
to hear from you."
Mr. Green replied in a worried
voice, "It seems I've started
Hell on earth; could you come and
show me what to do?"

"Is there anything left for me to
do?" the Devil asked,
"My dear old friend Mr. Green,
If there's even a tiny thing I can
do to help
I'll be there smiling like a sunbeam.

Mr. Green replied: "I've been planning
this for many years,
And I have started out to win.
It will be a first class job, I'll say,
If you just stick to me like a frien'.

"Even if hundreds starve to death,
I plan to have my way at any cost.
For there are too many common
people,
To lose a few thousand of them
wouldn't be much loss.

"I'm killing the hopes of both old
and young,
I scattered promises in homes like
sunshine from the sky,
And if they do not receive relief,
What is it to us - if they do die.

"And not so long ago I started out,
The President to see,
little union,
To tell him all about each and every
Thatw ould be organized and run
by me.

"I was trying to run things to suit
my self,
But now it seems I have been too
slow,
For there's a larger union that I'll
ever have,
Run by a man named Lewis, of the
CIO.

"He offered to be friends and settle
this dispute.
By making all the little unions one
big band,
But with him I did not agree,
just to suggest that, I thought he
had a lot of sand.

"At first I strutted and made believe
I was the big high you.
I would not listen to him or about
his plan;
But now I began to feel afraid,
For there's over four million that
beings to his band.

"This is why I called you, Mr. Devil,
I know I'll receive the best advice
from you,
So I'll just hang on and wait,
For I'm sure you'll know what
to do."

The Devil scratched his head, "My
dear Mr. Green, I'm sorry to say
it seems for that job you've rung your knell.
I'm afraid the CIO will make it a
thousand times hotter
for you there than I can for you
here in Hell.

As a Devil, I too have been a
mighty crooked old cuss,
But it seems I'm  not half so crooked
as you.
I'll be waiting here at the gate,
turn my shovel over to you."
