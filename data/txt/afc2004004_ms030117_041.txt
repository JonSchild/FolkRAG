     If you could play like that, Miss Lizybeth, you could
make yo sweethearts jump right straddle of a limb.
     I used to be a cat man.
     (What's a cat man?)
     A cat. . . .ef I foun out a woman liked me the least bit,
she was my plunder.  She was mine.  All I had to do was fin out sh e
liked me the least bit.  She could tell me no all she wanted
to, an I'd g o right on.
     (Did you always succeed with them?)
     Who me?  I'm goin on fifty-five years ole, and I nevah
h ave missed one yit.  Nevah missed one yi t.  That's right.  She may
tell me no fo a while, but she mean yes.  They jis can't git away
from me.  I git around em, an git to talkin so pitiful, an go to
playin my guitar. . .Yeah, GIVE me what I calls fur.
     (When you talk pitiful, what would you say?)
     WHAT WOULD I SAY?  Good Lawd, I couldn't hardly
tell you what would I say.  Cause I tell you, if I had to talk, I'd
still know how to talk right on.  That de truth.  An I wear huh out,
too, from my talkin.  Any time I h ave to talk hard fo a  thing,
she sees a hard time.
     (Do you like women better, if you have to chase them
h ard to get them?)
     If I have to chase em hard to get em, that's the time
