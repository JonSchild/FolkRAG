    WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.--An object
lesson for the American people--
and perhaps for President Roosevelt
--has been provided during the last
two weeks by the flood of rumors
that swept the country as a result
of the silence imposed upon newspapers 
and radio in connection with
the President's tour of war plants.
    That lesson, in the opinion of
Washington correspondents, who
heard only the grave rumors, the
comical rumors and the silly rumors
that reached this one city, can be
summed up in this way:
          If the freedom of press and 
      speech is not maintained to the
      greatest possible extent compatible
      with military necessity, then
      the United States from coast to
      coast, from village to city, might
      become the greatest rumor factory
      in the world.
          The passing harm done by the
      innocent rumors circulated in this
      case by honest Americans might
      easily be transformed into certain
      harm if enemy agents really went
      to work at rumor-spreading in
      future cases that afford similar
      opportunity.

       Press and Radio Blameless

    It should be made clear at the
outset that the Roosevelt-trip
rumors did not emanate from press
and radio.  They were born because
press and ratio were stilled.  They
were passed along from mouth to
mouth, from city to city and from
state to state because press and
radio were not privileged to blast
them with the best weapon--quick
