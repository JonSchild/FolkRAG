Nell:   I knowed that ever since I was nine years old, I'd have to
(unint) feed then calves, I'd bring it, and they never had no
upper teeth.     (Techn.)    (banjo)

AL:   Would you tell 'em what the name of that song was?

Sheila:   Sure, that was "Fly Around my Pretty Little Miss", for 
Susan (unint).

AL:   Let's get our audience back and have a couple of ballads.

Sheila:   Just think you're singing "Little Betty Ann" and sing
"Little Margaret" just let her shoot and sing.

Woman:   Cass, why don't you sing "Little Margaret?"

Cass:   I don't know it.    (laughter)    "Little Betty Ann's" a good one.
(sings):  (Little Betty Ann)   ". . . . . .you slighted me llittle girl. ."

Woman:   What'd she do, ruin youall?

Sheila:   Yeah, similar tune to Little Margaret.

AL:   Let's hear Little Margaret, I haven't heard that in years.

Sheila:   (sings) :  "Little Margaret sitting in her high-hog chair,
combin' her long yellow hair/ Saw sweet William and his new maid
bride riding up the road so near/  She threw down her ivory comb,
threw back her lo ng yellow hair/ said 'I'll go down and bid him
farewell' never more go there."

Techn:   let's start again . . . from the beginning . . .

Sheila:   (Little Margaret)   (never more go there)/ It was late in
the night, they were fast asleep/ Little Margaret appeared all
dressed in white, standing at their bedfeet/ said . . . shoot, sorry . . .
