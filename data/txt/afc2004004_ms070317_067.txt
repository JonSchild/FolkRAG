a tough little Irishman, on a 
crutch sells pencils, travels in
and out of Greenville on the
construction gang circuit says a
construction worker will always
give you a $1 or two, has been
a "dirt man" all his life
on levee camps, grading dirt
for n.n. , fills it, worked
all over the continent in
Guatemala, dead beat & broke
now like all construction
men - contractors or workers -

Says the Lorentz boys still live
at Driver, Ark., ran the
Driver Construction Co.

Says " Mister Charley" was
Charley Sillas who made
a fortune & then when he
went broke, walked off in
the river.  Mister Charley
who shot the Money Man.
