Dear Mr. Lomax
It is customary for the City Sales Tax Dept.
to verify out of town deliveries that are tax
exempt. Should you receive a questionaire from
this Dept. we submit to refresh your memory as
per the exemption certificate the information
given to the department.

This is a routine procedure to check on the
dealer and the customer to make sure that only
those people that are entitled to exemption
from the City Sales Tax get that exemption.
If this is not clear to you, your inquiry will
be appreciated.
Very truly yours,
WELLNER MOTORS, INC.
