or, if contract forbids that, it could be named after your
father, whose name is well-known to our ballad-singers
from "Folk-Song U.S.A"
          I would suggest the award be to the value of 1 guinea,
and if it proved the success I hope and intent it to prove,
I would ask you to make it a yearly one. The conditions
would be entirely up to yourself, but again I suggest it
might be awarded as an over-all first prize in the above
competition. The judges would be our head music-master
myself and a third person. If you, yourself, could be
up here one June when the competition was on and act as
the third judge - that would be FORMIDABLE!
                                   With All Good Wishes,
                                                 R. H. Blythman.
P.S. Please extend the good wishes to Peggy Seeger. We would
certainly enjoy another visit from her.
