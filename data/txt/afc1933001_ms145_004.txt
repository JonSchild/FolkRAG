Mr. Alan Lomax
124 W 12th Street
New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I opened the enclosed letter thinking
that it was something I had ordered
sent direct to Father.  If you will
please explain what the bill is for, I
will try to expedite matters.

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S. This is just to remind you that you
are scheduled to return to full time work
on June 1, so let me  know when school ends.

HS
