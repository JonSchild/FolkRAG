Ask my sister, please don't be like me,
Ask my sister, please don't be like me,
It is better to have the things you don't want than to go free.

Now I'm back here for my natural life, 
I'm back here for my natural life,
All I hate I ain't got nothing but my life.

I killed that gal but I never will know.

I'm sorry, sorry, sorry to my heart,

I'm sorry that that argument ever did start.

I'm in jail now and he's got him another bitch,
Yes, I'm in jail and my man's got another bitch,
I hate him too, he's a dirty, rotten son of a bitch.

I pray and pray and pray and pray,
I pray and pray and pray,
The the Lawd will show me another day.
