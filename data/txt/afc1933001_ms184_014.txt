I was awfully embarrassed about the matter of the test
pressings, and I am sorry to have caused the worry. But my
whole teaching schedule had been laid out around the use
of records, and there was no time to change at that late
date. The accidents of life kept occurring as I thought
they would, and I was not able to use them entirely until
today at noon. I will get them out on the afternoon train.

Here are my suggestions about the USO club activities.
(1)  Recordings of folksongs particularly hill billy tunes
and negro blues and including our own pressings to be
available in USO club rooms. I can work up a list of such
recordings on very short notice.  (2)  A guitar, banjo, 
fiddle and mandolin to be made available in all USO club
rooms, along with simple visual instruction books for the 
use of these instruments.  (3)  A small library of mainly
pamphlet collections of American folksongs, to be made
available in the USO club rooms, including such standard
books as Sound Off, Cowboy Songs, etc.  (4)  A special
regional song book published by the USO containing folk
songs according to the regions along the lines that we
have already discussed.  (5)  The encouragement of the compoisition 
of new songs by song writers contests in which
the emphasis can be laid on folk and semi-popular material
rather than popular material. Devices like a bulletin board
for new songs and rhymes or letter boxes for the same to be
used in the club rooms themselves. The directors of the 
club room must make a special point of rounding up fugitive
soldier verse and paradies and sending it in to a central 
office for editing. Certain portions of this material
could then be edited and shipped back to the various
USO offices in mimeographed form for the use of the men
there.  (6)  In almost any American town now, especially 
in the South, there are various semi-professional folk
musicians, hill billy performers, or blues singers whose
services in entertaining men at the club would, it seems 
to me, be invaluable. I hope these suggestions are in
line with your needs. We are lucky in having Mr. Gainer
in that spot, because he is an old-time West Virginia
collector who, by the way, has offered his collection to
the Library of Congress. Give him my best regards when you
see him.

I believe that my visit here has been a successful
one. After tomorrow's last lecture, I shall have been on
the boards 11 times, mostly for two hours at a stretch,
and there are still a few people who are listening to my
line of chatter. The only fly in my ointment is this
matter of leave. Jo writes me that it has been handed in
as annual leave from June 26 to the 11th. My visit to Chappell
in West Virginia which lost about a day means a good relationship
