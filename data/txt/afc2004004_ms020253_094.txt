(CHURCH PROCEDURE
RE:  CHARACTER JUDGMENTS)

BJ:  An' he said, said, "Well, if you gonna, gonna, gonna an'
obey the devil," said, "Tha's you."  Said, "But you got to git
consent."  Said, "What is your reason?  What is the reason?  What
have we done to ya?  So all this come from your own se'f.  An'
listen to your husban' to come in here an' to, an' to condemn yo' --
his brother -- an', an' yo' sister-in-law."  Say, "Either one or
'em not condemned."  Hum, hum!  See?  Not at all.  He said, "Now,
the condemnment fell on you, an' then you done prayed it off an'
now you wanna go?"  He said, "We has to let you go."  He said,
"We cain't -- fo'ced (forced) meat don't keep."
     That's the first time I had heard that word, an' it's true.
Fo'ced meat, fo'ced meat dont keep!  You know?  Fo'ced meat, just
like that meat you got in there.  Hit just don't keep.  Ha, tha's
all to it!  You know, if you fo'ce anybody inta anything, they
ain't gonna keep.  No use a keepin' ya if they don'
wanna go.  You don' wanna stay.  Git on away.  An' so
he give her her original paper.                            her
she was gonna jine the church ov' the sugar mill.  An' ah, next we
heard anything, she's out.  Next I heard any thing
-- we had some to the stage, didn' we?  Went back down there in
Mia -- in Jacksonville -- we heard that she was a big drunk in, in,
in Miami, ah, Palm Beach.  The biggest drunkard ya ever wanna see,
they say.
     So finally after that she -- an' Boy done quit 'er; married
'nother woman.  I'm sure a that 'cause Boy done stayed with us.
Went up an' stayed with us, ya heah?  He married a woman from
out -- from my Mama's home.  Sure did.
TL:  Bessie, does that kind of thing go on in the church all
the time?  Do they have judgments like that. . .?
BJ:  They have to have judgments.  In every church.  The council.
