Attached is a memorandum outlining a projected trip by John A.
Lomax to collect folk-songs in Texas, New Mexico, and western
Oklahoma. Mr. Lomax was to have collaborated on a trip with Mrs.
R.P.Tartt to collect folk song recordings in Alabama,Spring 1942,
but Mrs. Tartt cannot make the necessary arrangements, and this trip
is a valuable substitute. To clear sufficient funds, the money
encumbered for "Tartt,Mrs.R.P. project …" for $500.00 should be
disencumbered. Another trip has also been cancelled and this, too,
might well be disencumbered at this time. It is listed on the  "quads"
as: "Material for a folk song recording expedition in West Virginia
conducted by Miss Margaret Valliant" — for $38.00.

The new trip for Mr. Lomax should produce much more valuable material
for the Archive, and I recommend that it be approved.
