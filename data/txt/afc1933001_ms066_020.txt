there, perhaps doing more recording
on that trip. The Milwaukee meeting,
as I recall, is in early July.
The February date did not give
me time to prepare the paper
I have in mind. Please return
the invitation I sent to you. I
have another letter from the
lady agreeing to the Milwaukee
engagement and assigning me
a tentative date. I had written
to her that acceptance must
come through you.

I hope this will be no
hurry-up job for you. You might
figure on 5 or 6 thousand miles
(not including Milwaukee)
and a hundred records.

Sincerely always,
John A. Lomax
