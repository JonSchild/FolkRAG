3. A special Bureau report on rumor for circulation
among Government officials. In the preparation of
this the working committee would like the cooperation
of a member of the editorial staff from the beginning
of the preparation of the draft, inasmuch as this report
will require editorial selection from the material 
available.

4. A special report on this particular rumor study which
could be circulated to people in the field who coop-
erated in this project. This should be edited so that
nothing would be distributed which might do harm if 
circulated among people who do not understand the need
for keeping such reports confidential.

5. A special guide to rumor reports to be used in the
developing of field staff for the continuing rumor study.
