Dear Mr. Lomax:
Miss Elizabeth Burchenal of the Folk Art Center at
670 Fifth Ave. told me that you know of a young
chap named Seeger who sings American folk songs
and that you might be able to tell me where I
could get in touch with him.
We are doing some Americanization work in connection
with the German Refugees and are trying to
present to them different aspects of American
culture and I thought perhaps the Mr. Seeger
might be willing to give some program of American
music.
Thanking you for any help you may be able to give
us in this matter.
Very truly yours,
Max Kahn
