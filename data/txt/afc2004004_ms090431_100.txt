Fisk, 18.  2.

Shake it to the east.
Shake it to the west.
Shake it to the very one
You love the best.

Uncle John Rabbit.
My name is Florence Rembert.  You get in a circle and cl[pa]ap your hands 
when you say Uncle John's old rabbit and say stop the jaw.

Uncle John's old rabbit,
Stop the jaw,
Got a mighty badhabit,
Stop the jaw.
He got in my garden, 
Stop the jaw.
And eat my tomatoes,
Stop the jaw,
And cabbage, too.

Hide and Seek.
Last night,
Night before,
24 hours,
At my door.

I got up,
Hit um in the head
With a rolling pin.

Ten, ten, double ten,
Hold in the no-ten,
No ray and Hoowaw hee.

Holler you ball,
I can't see you.
Hoowaw hee.

I ain't gonna count
but one more time,
And that's gonna be
When the sun goes down.
A fact I tell,
It's a fact, it's a fact.

Lost my nickel
In the railroad track.
Way [up yonder] down yonder
In the daybreak town
Gonna beat the levee down.
Hoowaw hee.

Mamie Burr is my name.  12 years old.
SA:  Do you no any more verses?

Way down yonder
In the A.B. Quarter
Some on blue
and Avee's daughter.
