Mr. Alan Lomax
Congressional Library
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have been notified by the administration of the
University that you will be the convocation speaker on November
7. As you probable already know, all the convocation lectures
are broadcast by the University of Minnesota Radio Station, WLB,
in Minneapolis. This broadcast will entail no additional work
on your part, since we will broadcast your talk as you present it
to the audience in Northrop Auditorium.

We are arranging a supplementary series of broadcasts
in order to present the convocation speakers to the radio
public in informal interviews. We have set aside for this program
a period on Thursday afternoon from 3:15 to 3:30; this time, we
have found, is usually convenient for the speakers appearing on
Thursday mornings. Periods will be available, however, on Wednesday
afternoon or on Friday morning in the event that a Thursday 
afternoon broadcast cannot be arranged.

You are under no obligation to take part in this 
interview, but we should like to have you appear if possible. The
University administration approves of this supplementary series,
but agrees with us that the scheduling of these programs is at the
convenience of the speakers. Perhaps I should explain that the
University of Minnesota Radio Station is an entirely non-commercial
organization, presenting only programs of educational character.
It is supported entirely by the University.

May I hear from you in the near future on this matter,
so that we can make up our publicity schedule?

Sincerely yours,
Burton Paulu
