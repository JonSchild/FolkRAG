portion of this morning talking with the very
dignified and most polite officials of the
Secretary of States office. [Nice?] workers
why you wished a pass- past when 
you were headed for this country.? I
did not know. Nor could I answer
many of the queries on the second of
two affidavits they ask for, since it 
was bound to confess that I had seen
Elizabeth only once, nor could I 
swear anything concurring her [por?]
[ertage?], etc., etc., etc. It seems to me
that in due time, should you con-
tinue to travel, you will eventually
become a loving and loyal citizen
of the United States. I read
 again your signed promise to defend
the government wherever called upon!
And I was interested in both your 
photographs, and thought Elizabeth 
looked much less severe and 
happy than you. I'm sure you 
several batches of unimportant
letters by slow mail this morning
in the Library [?] was touring
around and about which your motion
pictures machine letter [?] sketched
in his hand lovingly, Farther, 

[Miss?] seems blue and I guess she 
feels lonely and [?arted]. I'll have her 
here to help in June if she wants to come.
