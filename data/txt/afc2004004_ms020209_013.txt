singing off to a good start. The old traditional Negro spirituals
from the various churches will be heard as well as the modern gospel
singing. Sacred Harp singing, White church music, the modern Negro
choir. All of these aspects will be combined into a carefully
planned program.

I hope to have Dr. Willis James there to officiate, as well as 
Prof. C.L. Amy, and the leader of the community. Prof. Amy
taught school in Coweata County for 27 years and is one of the
respected figures of the community as well as a person who is dedicated
to bringing together the best in Negro and the White.

At the end of the festival, there will be a get-together on a
nearby hillside, where we will have fish frying and song trading till dark.

I hope to have the festival broadcasted on a local radio station and
with help, it might be possible to get Atlanta radio coverage.

I belive that I can do this Frolic for about $700, but I want to
talk to Ralph about all of the details. We need to get both the
White and the Negro community involved, and we need to let the
folks in Atlanta know that something very special and very new
is taking place right near them. I want to get at the grassroots
where the grassroots are. I want the city people to come to the
country to hear the music they love. I want the see the folk stay/
in their own home towns and sing there and have a place of
pride there. There is no reason why they can't be a cery important
part of their own rural community. I think that it will happen if we
don't take the singers from the place that understands them the
best and takes them for granted the most.
