the Saturday night concert who arranged for X rays Sunday morning at
UCLA and she has since been to the best orthopedist in town (who was
also there Saturday night!).  Yesterday we took her for a proper
examination to the orthopedist who gave her an ACTH shot in the knee
and says in his opinion surgery may not be necessary, he hopes.
He is a great one for conservative treatment, stressing very
carefully controlled exercise and is hopeful that the cortisone will
reduce the fluid without necessitating drainage.  Apparently she did
not break anything and she does not have a cyst -- the two things
that would really be dangerous.  So, at the moment she can do what
is necessary in performance, and we will keep her seeing the doctor
and the therapist and let you know if anything disastrous happens.
The doctors have made no charge (she's had about $200 worth of care
so far) and are knocking themselves out to preserve this unique charac-
ter with real pleasure I think.
     I went down day before yesterday on an emergency call from
John (they are living in an apartment about forty-five minutes from
here) to find the group was broke.  This turned out to be accidental;
they had figured on being paid cash as they came off the stage from
their various shows, and had sent money home.  I loaned them ten
bucks and charged over to Ed who, it turns out, is taking
care of their room and board while they are in California; he had not
been aware of the situation and sent money over right away.  So, since
nobody seemed to be in proper communication, I went down to the Ash
Grove after my class last night and had a meeting with John and Ed
and got their business straightened out, at least I hope so.  I also
talked with Ed and suggested his arranging all business matters with
John; Bessie is not feeling well anyway and would be delighted to 
relinquish the responsibility to John -- I think this is true and so
does John.  John, it turns out, had not pushed himself forward be-
cause Bessie had come out here first last year, and she had sent for
him to come out later.  This, he felt, put her in the position of 
group leader, and, as he kept remarking:  "You knows I got to live
with Bessie".  Anyways, he and Ed are communicating now and I hope that
will simplify matters; Ed told me afterward that this was the first
time in their entire acqaintance that John had said more than two words
to him.
     I also talked to John about Mabel who had behaved
very badly at the Sunday concert, upstaging John consistently and
goofing up the ring shouts by getting in front of everybody else.
She and Bessie have completely locked horns over the question of wearing
aprons for performance and it looks to me as though neither one will
give way.  John felt I should talk to Mabel and I will take it on,
though eventually it will have to be fought out within the group, I
suspect and may even come to a break, because I don't think Mabel is
in a mood to take anything from anybody.  Later, I suggested to Ed that
he take John's lead in artistic matters since he will be working with
them at times I can't be there.
     Saturday we will have a crack at the movie business.  Ted
is still enthusiastic though pessimistic about the results; he has
had too many wonderful things turn out badly for him and regards the
entire movie business as full of enormous pitfalls.  He is a damn nice
guy and we will do our best to turn out something decent; we re-
hearse Saturday afternoon and shoot Sunday so keep your finngers crossed.
     Two more things, honey.  The group finishes here the end
