Mr. Alan Lomax

Pursuant to our recent conversations, I should like very much to
recommend that Mr. Alan Lomax be authorized and directed to visit Haiti
in the interests of the Archive of American Folk-Song and to study and 
record there for the Archive the native folk-culture of the island.
For the duration of this expedition, which will probably consume four
to five months, it is also recommended that Mr. Lomax be placed on the
Library rolls at the rate of $30 per month, as a special and temporary
assistant assigned to the work of the Archive. Associated with Mr.
Lomax in his work will be Miss Zora Neale Hurston, of New York City, at
present holder of a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Mr. Lomax should be supplied with official transportation requests,
chargeable to "Increase of the Library," and should receive the usual per
diem allowance in lieu of subsistence, not to exceed $5.00 per day, to be
paid from the same appropriation.

All charges for raw materials and repairs should be met by the Li-
brary - those for materials (such as blank records) to be chargeable to
"Increase," those for needd repair and alteration of the recording apparatus
(including replacement of worn out parts), and for battery charging and
similar services should be met by the Library, to be chargeable to "Library
Building and Grounds (Furniture)". In this connection, Mr. Lomax should be
authorized to proceed, if necessary, to Bridgeport, Conn., before leaving
for Haiti, there to supervise and direct the overhauling of the Library's 
recorded, travel expenses including per diem to be met by the Library,
chargeable to "Increase."
