[*1] SEA ISLAND'S FOLK SINGERS TOP THE BEST
The Georgia Sea Iland singer dusted off annalmost forgotten
slave style of vacalizing  to run away with the playdits Thursday
night at the biggest - and best -folksong [fet] fest. held in 
Atlanta
The New York Times; Robert Shelton: 1965
[*2] The program was a vibrant excusion into [transplanted] [*stet]
authentic folk song. The Sea Iland quintet is a fascinatin 
grouo whoss choral call-and-response singing, energetic 
dancinggand brightly rhythmic hand-clapping held the audienc 
of nearly 500 persons engrossed. ...[The perfo4merns put on 
s show as musically appealing as it waw intellectually 
stimulating.] [*stet]

UCLA Campus Newspaper, summer, 1963:
[*6] Among the[t] traditional folk singers appearing at the Folk 
Music Festival, Bessie Jones is the most impressive.  
Her style is the simplest and most direct.  She always 
sings without accompaniment, Charles Seeger, eminent UCLA
musicologist participating in the festival, called her
style the most typical of the American tradition present
at the festival - [even in volume, steady in in tempo, and 
steady accent.]
San Francisco Sunday Chronicle, 1962; Dean Wallace: 
[*4] No description can do justice to these singers; they have
to be heard to be enjoyed.  There are a pair of tremendous
[solo sin] solo singers named Bessie Jones and John David, backed
by a miscellaneous group of fisherman and boatyard workers
who could hold theyr own against any professional ensemble in 
the business
In an interview with Pat Watters of the ATlanta Journal and Constitution
Bessie Jones says of her 19 concert in Carnegie Hall:
[*8] Carnegie Hall was bigger than a hotel all right. But there
was nothing but heads out there.  That's all right with me. 
As long as they peoples.  I an't afraid.  Long as they don't 
change their faces,  I know I'm scared when a snake jumps. 
something like that.  But people, that's all I know.
