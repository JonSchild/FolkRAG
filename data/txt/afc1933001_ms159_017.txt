Dear Mr. Lomax,

I have been informed that you have completed
a collection of American folk songs for the publication of which you have
not yet made arrangements. If this information is correct, I would be
very happy to have the opportunity of inspecting the material. I can
assure you that your manuscript will receive the most friendly consideration
and I shall be very glad to hear from you.

Yours faithfully
for ALFRED A. KNOPF, INC.
