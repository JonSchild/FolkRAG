Today's Meeting
May Determine
Credit Question

Today may be the day of reckoning for the signers of
petitions requesting either more credit or less hours in
certain controversial courses, as the Administrative War
council meets to consider the matter this afternoon.

Students had registered complaints
regarding courses which 
under a normal semester would
have given them three hours credit,
but which have been cut to 2 1/2
hours because of the split summer
semester.

Petitions hearing the names of
a large number of effected students
received action at the last
meeting of the council which was
a joint gathering with the Student
War council. At that time an investigating
committee was appointed
by President Wells to examine
grounds for complaints on the part
of the students and to recommend
a course of action.

To Recommend Reduction.

The committee, consisting of four
students and three faculty members
met last week to consider the
matter and will recommend that a
15 per cent reduction in the amount
of work given by instructors in the
controversial courses be made.

Professor A. L. Kohlmeier, head
of the Department of History, was
named to write the report of the
fact-finding committee. He will
present the matter to the administrative
group for their consideration.

Less Credit for Some Work.

Announcement of the suggestion
which will be made by the committee
was made following their
first meeting just after the close
of the first eight week period. At
that time it was pointed out that
the amount of work covered in
three hour courses remained the
same even though credit had been
cut to 2 1/2 hours because of a re-

Campus Groups
To Join Drive
For Bond Sales

Led by the Student War council
all campus organizations are expected
to join soon in an "all out"
sale of War Savings stamps and
bonds in a permanent booth which
will be set up in the Union building.

Len Bunger, senior, has been
placed in charge of the campaign
by the Student War council and
he has announced that the campaign
will be continued "for the
duration."

To Set Up Booth.

Feeling that students should have
an opportunity at near hand where
they can join in the bond buying,
the council formulated plans for
the permanent booth at their last
meeting. The approval of the campaign
came swiftly from J. E. Patrick,
director of the Indiana Union.

The booth will resemble that set
up last semester by Scabbard and
Blade society except that pains will
be taken to construct a smaller selling
place. Headquarters for the
sales will be in the same location
as that of the previous campaign,
opposite the south entrance to the
cafeteria and the Commons in the

Lomax To Review
Negro Spirituals
At 8 P.M. Convo

Presented Lecture on Negro
Work—Songs Last
Night.

For several minutes last night
the man who will present the folk-song
recital at 8 o'clock tonight in
the Auditorium wasn't a folklore
librarian lecturing to a University
class, and his audience wasn't a
group of students taking notes.
Alan Lomax was a Negro slave,
and his students were fellow-workmen
in a Southern prison.

These magic moments were the
part of Mr. Lomax's two-hour lecture
on Negro worksongs in which
he led the songs as his students
swung into the choruses with him.

Creates Realistic Atmosphere.

Cotton bolls seemed almost to
be growing out of the books on the
shelves of that third-floor room of
the Library and the wooden floor
reminded one more of ground worn
smooth by dancers' feet, as some
of the students tapped their shoes
and nodded their heads with the
syncopation of Mr. Lomax's singing.

Mr. Lomax played records of all
phases of Negro music in his survey
showing the "swapping" of music
between the immigrant Africans
and the native whites. He pointed
out that this phenomenom of reciprocal
composition was purely
American, that Negro music in other
countries had retained its isolated
qualities.

Previews Recital Tonight.

As samples of one kind of song
that Mr. Lomax will present in his
recital tonight, members and visitors
of the "Introduction to Folklore"
class heard records of Negro
children singing as they played and
danced, of Negro workmen singing
as they worked at every kind of
job in the South, and of the originators
of jazz beating cut the
rhythm that was to sweep the
world.

Mr. Lomax played records con-

Dr. Swartz To Speak

But Inspector—
Soap, Not Soup

NEW YORK, July 7.—(AP)—A
misplaced vowel cost Eng Lang
Chinese restaurateur, a $5 fine to-
day after a health inspector testified
in municipal court that Lang
told him he had used rancid fat to
make soup.

Lang paid the fine but insisted:
"I told him soap—not soup."

Fire "Alarm"
Is False Alarm
To I.U. Campus

Tuesday's Drill, as in Past
Performances, Lacks
Co-operation.

At about 9:45 o'clock Tuesday
morning a loud bell rang. Some
classes were dismissed and students
slowly straggled outside, other
classes continued for the remaining
five minutes. "Believe it or
not," that was a fire drill.

The fire alarm rang in every
building with classrooms, yet it
was reported that only about half
of the students observed the fire
drill which was the first for this
half semester. There was no alarm
in the Library because of the extensive
alterations there.

Although the most convenient
hour on the whole was chosen by
the superintendent of buildings and
grounds for the drill, Tuesday's
drill was but a repeat performance
of others of the past.

Henry Pearson, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, echoed the
opinion of many persons on the
campus when he said Tuesday, "I
feel that we should have better co-operation
on the fire drills than we
have had in the past." He said
that drills are dependent on the
co-operation of students and faculty
because we have no way of enforcing
them.

Mentioning the efficiency of fire
and air raid drills in the East, Mr.
Pearson said that if we ever have
air raid drills on the campus, he
hoped that they would not be simi-
