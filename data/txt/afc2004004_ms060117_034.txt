Dear Mr. Lomax:
     This is just a note to remind you that we are expecting your essay
on contemporary American folk songs and folk music.  We are looking
forward very much to printing it in our spring issue.
As a personal question, what are your fees for concerts, lectures, or
general talks and what would it take to get you to come to Minnesota for
a year as a teacher?
Very truly yours,
Harry O. Weber
