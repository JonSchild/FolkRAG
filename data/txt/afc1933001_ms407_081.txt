It's now our outfit was complete--seven
able bodied men,
With navy six and needle gun--our troubles
did begin.
Our way it was a pleasant one, the route
we had to go,
Until we crossed Pease River on the range
of the buffalo.

It's now we've crossed Pease River, our
troubles have begun,
The first damned tail I went to rip. Ouch!
how I cut my thumb!
While skinning the damned old stinkers,
our lives they had no show,
For the Indians watched to pick us off,
while skinning the buffalo,

He fed us on such sorry chuck I wished
myself most dead.
It was old jerked beef, croton coffee, and
sour bread.
Pease River's salty as hell fire, the water I
could not go,
Oh, how I wished I never had come to
the range of the buffalo.

Our meat it was buffalo hump and ironwedge
bread,
And all we had to sleep on was a buffalo
robe for abed;
The fleas and graybacks worked on us,
oh, boys, it was not slow,
I tell you there's no worse hell on earth
than the range of the buffalo.

Our hearts were cased with buffalo hocks,
our souls were ceased with steel,
And the hardships of that summer would nearly make
us reel.
While skinning the damned old stinkers,
our lives they had no show,
For the Indians waited to pick us off on
the hills of Mexico.

The season being near over, old Crego he
did say
The crowd had been extravagant, was in
debt to him that day.
We coaxed him and we begged him, but
still it was no go--
We left old Crego's bones to bleach on the
range of the buffalo.
