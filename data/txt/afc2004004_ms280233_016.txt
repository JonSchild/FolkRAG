2) Throw him over, over, throw him over sea,
Throw him over, over, hell be here today.
Throw him over, over, throw him over sea,
Throw him over, over, he[re]'ll be here today.

3) He didn't dance, dance, he didn't dance today, /
He didn't dance, dance, no, nor yesterday. /2

4) Throw him up, up, throw him up high,
Throw him up, up, he'll be here bye 'n-bye. (2)
5) Cucanandy chorus.

'Tis very hard to explain what it means. In fact, there isn't
much meaning to it, but some little thing like "Cucanandy."
You couldn't make head or tail of it because it didn't mean
anything, but just to put it in, like for a finishing.

Well, there is not much expanation. This man was very fond of
a drop. And the priest didn't like it. So he often took the
pledge, and I suppose, broke the pledge. But himself and the
priest fell out, and he didn't like him at all then, and they
idn't like him. But he composed a song for himself and a little
verse for the priest in the end. That's how he finished it.
(Then sings in Gaelic.) PAUSE & BREAK)

Cronin: . . . . . .fifty three years ago.
Lomax: And what was the first song that you ever learned ? DO
you remember?
Cronin: I don't. No, no.
Lomax: Did you sing a lot when you were a little girl?
Cronin: I did. A whole lot. I sang here, there and everywhere.
At weddings and parties and at hom e and milking the cows in
the stall and whashing the clothes and sweeping the house and 
stripping the cabbage for the cattle and ([gaelic] digging stones abroad in the field) doing
everything.
Lomax: Like a bird. Doing it all the time. Where did you learm
thesongs that you know, Mrs. Cronin?
Cronin: Well, I learned a lot of them from my mother and then I
learned more of them -- course, we used to have alots of
serants at the time. You'd have one for five or six months,
and then that one would leave and another one would come - there
would be someone always coming or going, or a girl, cousins and 
friends coming along -- like anywhere.
