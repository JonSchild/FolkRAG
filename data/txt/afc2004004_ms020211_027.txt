February 17, 1964

Dear Mr. Lomax,

The appearance of The Georgia Sea Islanders at The Tyrone Guthrie Theater
was more than a resounding success.  The house was filled -- 1437 seats --
and many more were turned away at the doors.  It was clear to me that the
Sea Islanders were the hit of the night -- especially surprising and pleasing
in that Minneapolis has never before exhibited any interest in genuine folk
music and only fickle enthusiasm for the folkniks.  In making available to
folk performers their facilities of publicity and presentation I feel Walker
Art Center and the Guthrie Theater have done our city a tremendous service.

Mississippi John Hurt met Bessie and friends on the afternoon of the concert
and all took to each other like lifetime friends.  Within minutes they
were laughing together, swapping tales, and Hurt was improvising wonderful
old-time guitar accompaniment to their singing.  The jam session that afternoon
was so enjoyable both to the musicians and to myself and my friends that
I decided then and there to turn them loose on the stage that night with no
further rehearsal.  The Sea Islanders, especially Mabel Hillary, were no less
eager and confident at the prospect than was Mississippi John.

The outcome, as I had anticipated, was the high point of the show.  Mabel and
Mississippi John first improvised a verse-swapping blues that was exceptionally
well received by the audience, due primarily to the visible onstage interplay
of the two personalities.  The rest of the group then joined them for GO DOWN,
MOSES, Hurt especially rising to the occasion with his guitar runs, SALTY DOG
(of which Bessie seemed not to approve) with excellent dancing from John Davis,
and then what was for me the most moving few minutes of the evening, the finale,
THE BUZZARD LOPE.

Due to the exceptional acoustics of the house, I decided not to impede either
the Sea Islanders' voices or movements with microphones, and let them perform
with "natural" sound.  I regret that because of this decision we did not obtain
tapes of the performance, but I can assure you that in John Hurt you would have
the ideal accompanist for the group.  If circumstances ever brings them all together
again, it would be criminal if the occasion is not recorded with movie
camera and tape equipment.

I personally have never felt so confronted by the intimacy of Negro music as 
I did during the sessions of Hurt and the Sea Islanders, and relaxing with
them drinking and talking and laughing away a winter afternoon is an experience
I will never forget.  I hope the group was able to report to you on their trip
to Minneapolis as favorably as I have.

Sincerely
Jon Pankake
