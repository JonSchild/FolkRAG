GALLEY TWENTY-one

*Amalgamated from thirty-six separate sources.

"Oh, then bury me not on the lone prairie,*
In a narrow grave six foot by three,
Where the buffalo paws o'er a prairie sea.
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.

"I've always wished to be laid when I died
In the little churchyard on the green hillside;
By my father's grace there let mine be,
And bury me not on the lone prairie.

"Let my death slumber be where my mother's prayer
And a sister's tear will mingle there,
Where my friends can come and weep o'er me;
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.

"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie 
In a narrow grave just six by three,
Where the buzzard waits and the wind blows free;
Then bury me not on the lone prairie.

"There is another whose tears may be shed
For one who lies on a prairie bed;
It pained me then and it pains me now;-
She has curled these locks, she has kissed this brow.

*The varying "choruses," or refrains, are printed to illustrate the results of different
composers of the song, not with pen and paper at hand, but evolved, perhaps, as a cowboy
rode alone over the prairie. We may read them now as another example of the survival of the fittest.

"These locks she has curled, shall the rattlesnake kiss,
This brow she has kissed, shall the cold grave press?
For the sake of the loved ones that will weep for me,
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.

"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
Where the wild coyotes will how o'er me,
Where the buzzard beats and the wind goes free.
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.

"Oh, bury me not-" And his voice failed there.
But we took no heed of his dying [??]
