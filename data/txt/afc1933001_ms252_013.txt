DALLAS, TEXAS  6-13-1942

Dear Alan : I'll make the trip as 
the swan song of my ballad collecting
career. My adventures begin 
with the cowboy. I'll not finish 
the book until I come back,
making the last chapter, fittingly,
deal with the West and its
wrinkled cattlemen.
Four needles will hardly 
do. They wear out very fast
on these glass-based new records.
Sent me two. I'll send in soon 
an equal number to be resharpened. 
Send also 25 blank records.
Recently I've starved off 
8 pounds and am feeling much 
better. Maybe this trip will renew
