"Flood In This Land"
Composed by Elder J. H. Brown

1
It was in Nineteen Thirty-seven
God sent His rain down from heaven,
The people thought it ought to stop,
It filled all the rivers to the top.

Chorus
My God is in this land
God is working in the land
God is working with His hand
Sent a flood through the sinful land

2
About the time they thought the rain was off,
God sent a flood down from the north
It came down from Mississippi and Arkansas,
People said all we have is about to be lost.

3
Now we see God's working in the land,
People seems so hard to understand,
He sent this warning to the wicked man,
Put your sins down out of your hand,
Now we see God's working in the land.

4
People this is an awful day
You ought to teach your children how to pray,
The time is coming that we shall be away,
If we don't be right that will be an awful day.

5
Now people wasn't that an awful sight,
It should make everybody want to live right,
He said He was coming as a thief by night,
You can't tell when we've got to make our flight

6
Now we are at halt, about what to do,
But listen people, God is not through,
He sent this warning down to you,
I am going to serve Jesus, how about you?

7
When the warning rang out the people had
to flee,
Many started out to Memphis, Tennessee,
Some was crying, Lord have mercy on me
Some was sick as they could be.

8
Please read Jeremiah forty-seven, two and three,
It will show you why this water had to be,
There was many thousands had to flee,
Running from the waters of the mighty deep.

9
Now listen people! God is not mean
But it's just a warning to the people that everyone
should live clean
And you will see God's power upon human being
He will move our burden like a dream.
