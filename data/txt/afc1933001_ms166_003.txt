Dear Alan:

I am sorry to hear you have been sick and happy that you are
better now.
 
You haven't heard quite accurate reports about my feeling toward
"Back Where I Come From".  I do think there is a lot of room for 
improvement in it but feel that the changes now being made are 
helping a lot.  Despite Woody's many gifts, I think it possible
that we will put on better shows without him, particularly since
we shall have Earl Robinson to call on all the time and Pete
Seeger part of the time. 

We are planning to keep "Back Where I Come From" on during the 
next three-month period.  I feel, and Bill Lewis and Frank Barton
agree, that it is essential to abandon the topical treatment. 
The copyright complications make it very difficult time and again
to clear enough tunes which bear on a particular subject.  We 
often find ourselves straining for unity and dragging in numbers
 that don't really belong on the show. We want to try it for 
awhile as a straight variety show with m.c. One thing can still
lead to another on such a program with a good deal of logic but 
it will give us more chance to get contrasts into shows and to 
choose the most attractive materials available.  In other words,
it has to be a little less documentary and more entertainment if 
we are to reach additional listeners.  I still feel that the 
program has something very important to say and that it is opening
up new fields. 

Please give my kindest regards to Elizabeth and come to see me 
the first time you are in New York. 

Sincerely, 
Dave
Davidson Taylor
