Perhaps the popularity of Agaous who is not a local loa is due to the influence
of Revolie's mother's family in Le Roux and of other families like
hers. At any rate a great many of his brothers and sisters
live in the settlement and are importantly concerned in the actitivies
of the vaudou cult . Saul is one of the best drummers. Two of his
sisters are important hounsi. And Dodo, his father, is La Place on
whom Theoline the mombo leans hard in all emergencies. He is old,
sophisticated and Theoline is not ready to take the ason yet as a full-fleged
mombo, to take it and carry it with her away from the hounfort.
At any rate Agasou was called ,somewhat violat-
ing the ceremonial order of the songs that Revolie had given me that
afternoon before . A Zepaules Dahomey.

(52B2)
Agasou, m' pr' all' nans Guine,
Agasou Yeme, m' pr' all' nans Guine,
Pecheur le te pas Bon Dieu.

I am Agasou, I'm going away to Guine,*
I am Agasou Yeme, I'm going away to Guine,
(Because) a mortal man is not God.

Another Mayis for Agasou.

(52A3)
Aye-o, celere,                         Aye, hurrying,
Agasou, dos m' celere,          Agaous, I'm hurrying.

*Guinea , Africa, the country of the loa, like the land o'
the powerful dead, like heaven.
