I'M A JOINER
Tune--Battle Hymn of the Republic.
Oh I've joined and joined and joined again whatever
    came along,
But I've joined to keep the flag afloat of each progressive
    throng;
And I'll join again if join must be, to save our liberty,
As we keep keeping on.

Chorus--
Now I've joined the Farmer's Union,
Now I've joined the Farmer's Union,
Now I've joined the Farmer's Union,
To keep on keeping on.

Yes I joined the League Non-Partisan and joined the
    Equity,
And I joined the People's party in a fight for liberty.
Then I put a hundred dollars in a paper called the Star,
And kept on keeping on.

We built a co-op creamery to fight the dairy cheat,
I sunk a couple hundred in the battle for our wheat.
The Old Produces 'Liance, I jumped in up to my neck,
And kept on keeping on.

Well, there's nothing more to join I guess, The Union's
    got the job,
If it don't turn the trick I guess, we'll all sit down and
    sob.
But I'm trusting in the Union and I'm sure it will win.
So keep on keeping on.

THE UNION WILL SHINE
Tune--Our Boys Will Shine Tonight.
The Union will shine tonight,
The Union will shine tonight,
The Union will shine tonight,
All down the line, Rah! Rah! Rah!
The Union will shine tonight,
The Union will shine.
When the sun goes down,
When the moon comes up,
The Union will shine.
