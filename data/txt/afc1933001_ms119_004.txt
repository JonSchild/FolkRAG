Mr. Alan Lomax
Box A-32
Port-au-Prince, Haiti

Dear Alan:

The Librarian has just shown me your latest
report, and the package of records which you spoke
of sending to us arrive this morning.

Dr. Putnam and I are agreed that your stay in
Haiti ought to be continued a little longer, and I 
believe the Librarian has already written to you to
this effect. In the meantime, we are making inquiries 
into the possibility of securing a camera for 
you. 

Since I am leaving for Baltimore this afternoon 
and shall be leaving again tomorrow evening
for Boston, I am afraid that I shall have to defer
a full reply until early next week. For the present,
then, this acknowledgment only--and my heartiest congratulations 
to you and to Mrs. Alan.

Faithfully yours,

OS:ep
