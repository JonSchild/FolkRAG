Dear

I've been travelling the roads of the world, hitting the
 high places and the low places, the rough and the smooth, for 
about twenty years, recording folksongs and ballads from
 all sorts of people, but I never have had such kind and warm-hearted
 treatment from anywhere as from the people of Scotland, and I
 just wanted to write you this letter and tell you how much I 
appreciated this.  It makes all kinds of difference when you're
 a long way from home, to be treated like you were a member of
 the family.

What you have done, however, is to help the folksongs of 
your country to be better known.  Thank you for your songs,
 which will be listened to by scholars and just ordinary people
 with the greatest interest and pleasure.

The people of Scotland recorded about twenty-five hours of 
their folksongs this summer.  The whole set will go to the
 University of Edinburgh folklore archive for the permanent 
benefit of the Scottish people.  Some will go to the BBC
 Permanent Records Library, and some will be published by the 
Columbia Records Company in New York City, and some will be
 used in my BBC broadcasts.  And all will be deposited in a
 museum in the U.S.A.  No use will be made of the records by
 me without first obtaining your written permission.

On December 4th you'll hear the broadcast of the collecting
 trip and the songs.  If your songs are in this show, you will 
already have been notified by the BBC.  Otherwise the [???] of the good songs you gave me as in the
