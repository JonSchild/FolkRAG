20) When they arrived in fair London
The gates were locked in;
And who was there but a trumpeter
Wi' a trumpet in his hand.

21)  "What's the matter?"  old Johnny says,
"What's the matter with them,
That the drums do beat and the bells do ring
And make such a doleful din?"

22) "Nae things the matter," the keeper said,
Nae things the matter to thee.
But a mighty Scot to stretch the rope,
And tomorrow he maun die."

23) "Open the gates," old Johnny said,
"Open the gates I say."
The trembling keeper smiled and said,
"But I hae not got the key."

24) "Open the gates," old Johnny said,
"Open the gates I say.
For there's a baody at my back
Frae Scotland's brought the key."

25) "Open the gate," said John O' North,
"Open them at my call."
And wi' his foot he has done in 
Three feet o' that wall.

26) As they rode down by fair London,
And doon by the town hall,
And there they saw young Johnny More 
Stand on the English wall.

27) "You're welcome here, my Uncle dear,
You're welcome here tae me.
You'll lose the knot and slack the rope
And take me frae the tree."

28) "O is't for murder or for theft,
or is't for robbery?
If it be for any o' these crimes,
There's no remedy for thee."

29) "It's nae for murder or for theft,
Nor yet for robbery.
It's all for loving a fair lady
They're going to gar me die."
