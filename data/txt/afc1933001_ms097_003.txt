Dear Dr. Botkin
Enclosed are notes on 
the second division of the 
John A. Lomax recording trip 
of 1942. Thank you for 
your patience.  And the 
records are in the express 
(Railway Express Co.) - There 
are three boxes: one contain'g 
fifteen blancs (15) and 2 
recorded discs; the other 
two boxes contain recorded 
discs (1 broken on our trip) 
*and one broken blank disc. 
The total number of recorded 
discs in this group is, 
I believe, 23. I wish we 
might have filled the other 
fifteen, and I'm sure we could 
have if Mr. Lomax's illness 
hadn't befallen us.
We both appreciate

[*I hope this time there are 
not many more broken. I tried to 
be careful in packing*]
