2.  COUNTERACTION OF RUMORS

There are two methods of counteracting rumors:

1. Direct Counteraction involves explicit citation 
(reproduction of rumor, designation as rumor)
of the rumor and refutation of it by an authoritative 
report or by blanket denial.
In the main, this method is to be avoided
as it may arouse public suspicion as to
the Government's motive in refuting the 
rumor and confusion as between rumor and 
refutation.

2. Indirect Counteraction recognizes that rumors
are often born of malevolent intention but that
they always breed on ignorance, curiosity and
confusion.  Thus this approach hopes to correct,
or prevent, rumors by attacking the conditions
which lead to their diffusion.

a. By supplying adequate information to the
public on problems about which there are
rumors.

b. By collaborating with the press and radio
in preventing the dissemination of rumor-
breeding or rumor-bred data.

c. By publicly explaining the process of
rumor development and dissemination ---
exposing its conscious originators and
ridiculing, as well as educating, its 
unwitting carriers.
