1. We have heard repeatedly on buses, on the streets, and in stores
and other gathering places, rumors to the effect that great numbers of
troops are being sent from Fort Jackson to ports of embarkation. In each 
instance the person stating the rumor said that the troops were being
moved in connection with the establishment of a second front by the allies. 
The first time this rumor was heard was on Monday, August 3, when
a woman passenger on a bus told a woman sitting beside her that a friend
of hers who was married to an army officer was giving up her apartment and
disposing of her furniture. The officer was leaving within a week for an
over-seas destination. The woman to whom this statement was made said she
also had friends who were making similar arrangements for the same reason.
