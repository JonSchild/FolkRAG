Dear Mr. Bayard:

I remember with what pleasure I looked over the material you 
sent John A. Lomax and myself in 1933 for inclusion in "American 
Ballads and Folk Song", and when I saw mention of your collection 
in the Southern Folklore Journal and other places, I was able to 
imagine just what it looked like.

You must know that the Library of Congress has brought a very 
healthy Archive of American Folk-Song into existence.  We lend recording 
machines (in a very limited way) and do duplicating work.  
We have a t least two field trips a year and have grown totoespectable 
proportions - 2,000 discs, 1,500 cylinders.  The next field 
trip that we plan to make, sometime within the next three or four 
months, is into Pennsylvania.  I should like to meet you and it 
will be most pleasant if we can do some field work together.  I 
don't know whether you have ever made any recordings in the field.  
If not, you should find it a most interesting experience.  The Archive, 
although it is primarily interested in collecting the best 
material and freeing it for public use, also understands the problem 
of the collector.  If, by any chance, you a interested in 
pre-publicationsrestrictions, we could settle that matter very simply.

This letter, of course, is a cast in the dark.  I shall await 
your reply with much interest.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
