TAPE:  1356 cont. Mrs. McGee    p. 

Dennis:     Somebody don't eat meat for seven weeks.

Mrs:     Till Easter.  Seven weeks without meat.

AL:     When you run Mardi Gras, you played the music?
Den:     Oh no.  Just runnin'.  I didn't know how to play the
music at that time.  I learned after that.
Around Mardi Gras, at my old parents, and when I
moved to that new, my little young parents, he's
the one that bought me the violin.  When I was
taught I was about 16 or 16 years old, and I
still play, since that.  I made some good money
with my violin.
 
AL:     Good. . . Now as a special favor for me today, for what
I did for you the other day, play me the "Mardi Gras"
tune, okay?

Den:  (plays)
