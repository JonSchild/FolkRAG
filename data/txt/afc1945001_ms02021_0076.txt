There is a rumor that it is the definite military policy
of Great Britain and the United States to let Russia fall into
the hands of Germany because Russia has been in the war long enough
and has borne the brunt of the war to such an extent that if, as
the result of the opening of a second front by England and the
United States, Germany would be defeated, Russia would then be
in a position to dictate the peace terms. Neither the United
States nor Great Britain can afford to let Russia dictate the
peace because of the variance of government policies, as well as
the fact that Russia is an economic rival and if Russia comes out
of this war in any kind of sound economic condition she will soon
control the world and it would mean economic bankruptcy for the
other Allied Nations. Therefore, the policy of Great Britain and
the United States is to give not more than token assistance to 
Russia until both Germany and Russia are exhausted; then open up
a second front, to be victorious and in a position to dictate peace
terms.
