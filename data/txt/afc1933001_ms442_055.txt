Got a Gal In Town
The four line stanza,[in] with the first verse repeated 
three times is [the] an old blues form, antedated only, perhaps, 
by the stanza in which one line is repeated three
times; and there is no rhyming verse[s]. This blues, with
its collection of unrelated [verses] stanzas, some of them 
inconsequential, some of them nearly meaningless, [some]
is typical of most blues as they are actually sung by the great mass of Negros in the South. For
a note on "fat-mouf" , see the Fort Worth and Dallas Blues.

(3) Got a gal in de country, ain' got no good way to go,
An' [a] I ain' goin' back there an' be her man no mo'.

Got a gal in town, got a mouf chuck full of gol',
Got a gal in town, got a mouf chuck full of gol',
Got a gal in town, got a mouf chuck full of gol',
Got a gal in town wid a fat-mouf payin' her boa'd.

Got a gal in town an' she ain' no hand-me-down,
She was born an' raised, babe, in Taylor-Town.*

[Rather see my co]
The woman I'm lovin', she can rob an' steal,
If you've ever been down,*** you know 'bout how[r] I feel.

Worked for you all summer, hon', an' part of de fall,
[Worked for you all summer, hon', an' part of de fall]
Come home an' took my Christmas, baby, in my overalls.

"Go 'way from my window, please stay 'way from my do',
'Cause you know I done tole you, woman, I can't use you [no mo'.]
    no mo'."

Rather [hear] see my coffin, daddy, comin' in my back do',
Than to hear you sayin', baby, you don't want me no mo'."

If you get one woman, better get you two or three,
Get one for yourself, podner, an' two for me.

*An obvious enough pun on "Taylor" and tailor, this verse
is a favorite with L.B.. It occurs again in So Doggone Soon.
[**Has no automobile? No money?*]
*** In the penitentiary, or broke.*]
