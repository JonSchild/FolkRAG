Dear Mr. [Str??k]:
The enclosed letter from 
Professor [R??d] Smith [ours] its
origin, as I may have told 
you, to a movement I helped 
to start last December (I 
wrote the resolution) of the
Dr [Lu?is] meeting of the modern
language association 
Before giving to the Convention 
I had discussed the matter 
with Mr. [Ei?gul] and he approved 
the idea I had in mind,
