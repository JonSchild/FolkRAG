1. Report on Field Experience

A more adequate acquaintance with Coahoma County was
gained in this field period than we had previously. Some contact
with all parts of the community was made, if only observation in
some areas. A good general impression of the total county organization
was secured horizontally in an immediate cross section, and
vertically from the oldest to youngest generation. The historical
process in the county was documented through interviews.

Much time was spent in the location of informants who
could perform musically and in the recording of the efforts of these
performers. From the oldest generation we secured interview material
where they were physically unable to play or sing, and in instances
where they refused to present secular music because they had become
church member and would not violate their reformation. A list of
the informants, with brief descriptive notations, was kept, and can
be presented later if necessary. A seemingly adequate amount of information
was secured on the lives and music of the oldest generation.
Children's games were recorded from the youngest generation, and
also from the third generation by the performance of children at the
Coahoma County Training School, at Friars Point, and at the Moorhead
