THAT OD TIME RELIGION

CHORUS #1: You need that
Old time religion,
Yes, you need the 
Old time religion,
Lawd, you need this
Old time religion,
It's good enough for me.

CHORUS #2: I got that
Old time religion,
Yes, I got that
Old time religion,
Lawd, I got this
Old time religion,
It's good enough for me.

Oh, stop, oh, sinner stop
Before you further go,
Now, don't you realize 
You'll owe the everlasting woe. [XXXXXXXX]  (CHORUS)
                                                                              #1

That old time religion
The[y] [chanted] king of long ago,
And it make your soul fee happy
And fill you with the Holy Ghost. [XXXXXXXXXX] (CHORUS #1)
                                                                               (CHORUS #2)

Oh, stop, oh, sinner stop
And think on your ways
'Cause, one day, I'm telling you,
There's going to be a judgment day. (CHORUS #1, CHORUS #2)

That old time religion,
The kind our fathers had,
It'll make your soul feel happy
And fix you for everlastin'.  (CHORUS #1, CHORUS #2)
