II.  Rationing–continued

     price ceiling it is just trouble for nothing." (Groceryman, 
     Birmingham, 8/11/42.

    "It's all right to ration gasoline just because we're in a war – for
    pleasure seekers – but when it interferes with my work it's going 
    too far." (Red Cross Representative from the east. Birmingham 
    8/11/42.)

    "Did you hear that Government official say they were rationing
    gasoline because there was a shortage of gasoline? That's a plain
    lie." (Businessman, Birmingham, 8/11/42.)

    "I heard that too, but later I read they were laying pipe line and
    as soon as they were completed there would be no more gasoline
    rationing – I think it's silly anyway. If people want to use their
    cars and wear out their tires it's their business. Why should the
    Government step in? I thought one of the things we were fighting
    for is Democracy – and if that isn't true I want my soldier boy back
    home." (Birmingham business man 8/11/42.)

    "We were short of sugar when the rationing first began – we didn't
    have a bit on hand, but we have plenty now! Yesterday I took my
    books down – all three of them, got six pounds of sugar and when I
    got home I still had stamps 6 and 7 in my book.   So I took them 
    down this morning and the storekeeper said I could get twelve 
    pounds more!   I don't know what I'd do with 18 pounds of sugar, 
    but he said I'd better get it before the 24th or else I'd lose it, so I'm 
    going to.   (Birmingham housewife 8/13/42.)
