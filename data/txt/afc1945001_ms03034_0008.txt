Mr. Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety 
18 Tremont Street
Boston, Massachusetts. 

Dear Mr. Knapp: 

Thank you for your note of June 8th. 

I trust that you understood our letter of June 4th 
and that it was clear to you that the Army was not wilfully 
withholding information which it possessed. On the contrary, 
they just do not have the information required to answer your 
question, since they do not uniformly keep records of religion. 

The rationing rumors which you report from your area 
are repeated in one form or another in many parts of the United 
States, according to correspondence received here and, of course, 
require energetic refutation by any reasonable means at the command 
of local authorities. 

We also wish to thank you for your supplementary note 
of January 9th, enclosing a batch of current rumors. We agree 
with you that not only are the rationing rumors important, 
but also the peace gossip bears careful watching. 

I hope that you will find time to send along to us in 
the future any similar matters which you may consider of common 
interest. 

Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) R. Keith Kane
