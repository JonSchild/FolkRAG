would be more comfortable building
a stage than sitting on one.  Following
the awards, each winner
gave a brief performance, with several
of the craftspeople making
short speeches. In their directness,
one sensed a creative tradition that
had never been geared to reward.
Most of the honorees have labored
unrecognized and unrewarded for
decades.  .  .  .

When Bessie Jones, the charismatic
Georgia Sea Island singer
who revived the intense black vocal
traditions, was helped by Douglas
and Frankie Quimby on the amen
song popularized in "Lilies of the 
Field," the Quimbys looked at her
lovingly.  "Bessie Jones is where we
come from," Douglas Quimby said.
