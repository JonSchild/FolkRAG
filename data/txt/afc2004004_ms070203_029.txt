O J, dearest J I know [ ?]
not what to do.
I've slighted rich & noble Lords
all for the love of you
[Fare you well yo ? ??  me]
[& kindreds]
I've slighted [?] & noble lords
all for the sake of thee
What dreams are those
[To that rude & savage ]
[countere]
disturb your[?] mind of wild
Amerikee

[Then we]
[our anchor]
[With crowded decks]
[& bending sails]
[We'll settle]
[contended]
[In that wide & savage]
[conteree of wild Amerikee]
