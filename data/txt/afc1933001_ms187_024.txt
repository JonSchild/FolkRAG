October 9, 1942
To the Librarian of Congress
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
   The Office of War Information has
requested my services for special work
beginning Monday, October 12th. Since
this seems to be an excellent opportunity
to be of value in the present
emergency, I am anxious to enter upon 
these duties. Therefore, I hereby
tender my resignation from the Library
of Congress, effective Saturday noon,
October 10th, with the request that at 
the end of the emergency period I may
resume my position in the Library.
     Respectfully submitted,
AL a Alan Lomax
T Assistant in Charge of the 
Archive of American Folk-Song
