Plantation fiasco.
Enclosed is George's nice letter. I plan to go to Dallas about next Wednesday for 3-4 days and hope the Pottses can put me up if convenient. If there is anything I can do for you there be sure to let me know. If this is late in reaching you in case you do wish my services, write me c/o Dr. Potts.
Texas has the makings of a big team, and I think she is to have a successful year and may mop up. I'm going over to S.A. tomorrow for a morning's work and will see A&M + Tulsa play in the afternoon.
Affectionately, your son, 
John
