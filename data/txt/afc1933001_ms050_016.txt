Dear Sir:

    We hope you will be interested in the enclosed provisional check
list of titles of folk songs that have recently accumulated in the
Folk Song Archive of the Library of Congress. Since that time more
than 400 twelve inch records have been added to the collection with
possibly a thousand new titles. Three hundred of these records were made
by Alan Lomax in Haiti, the remainder coming from white singers in the
South.

    Later we hope to send you a revised and corrected list with an
announcement of plans for furnishing duplicates of these records. Mean-
while we crave your indulgence for a number of errors in proof reading
in the enclosed circular.
 
    Very truly yours,
    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Consultant and Curator
    of the Folk Song Archive.
