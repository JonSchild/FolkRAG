Dear Dr. Spivacke:

Attached is a letter from Madame Comhaire who was kind
enough to correct our whole Haitian catalogue for us without charge,
devoting to the job a couple weeks of her time.

She asked to be allowed to purchase a few records and gave me
a list for an estimate. This estimate has not yet been made and 
Madame Comhaire has begun to wonder about her request (see attached
letter). 

I hope you will be able to clear the matter up. 

Sincerely, 

Alan Lomax
