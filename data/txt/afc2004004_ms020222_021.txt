BJ:  Well, to git any -- [You know] be sure your clo'es sterilized.
You know?  An' clean.  Clo'es'd be clean clear through.  It
wa'n' like jus' rinse them out an' puttin' 'em back on. They say that
you don't get all the germ out of 'em, you don't get all the
sweat out of 'em an' diffrunt things.  An' [that mean if you] then, den, when you do get
warm in 'em again, that throws it right up back into your body.
Ya see?  Therefore you got [whatch] what you call a sick, a sick body.
But clo'es, clo'es have a lot to do witchya.  See?  An' so, an'
their, an' they, an' they ah, they did that.  I love scaldin'
now.  You know, ah real hot water wit' things, but most peoples
now jus' rench e'em out or send 'em...you know, don't do anything...
an', an' what....
An' they made potash soap.  My mother still makin' it now,
for people.  Made potash soap, you know, ah, an' ah at that --
TL:  Do you know how to make it?
BJ:  Yes, I does.
TL:  Will you show me how?
BJ:  I ce'tainly will, um-hum.  An' ah, they made potach soap an'
you know, that clean the clo'es clear through.  An' so, therefore,
they kep' theirselves really clean.
Then they took herb medicine.  Take teas.  An' there was a 
time -- jus' like now, the fall of the year?  -- every year, I 
knew myse'f, we, they give us cer-certain medicine to clean us
out.  Which is fever grass, us call it.
TL:  Fever grass!
BJ:  Uh-hum.  Yeah.
TL:  What happens to you?
