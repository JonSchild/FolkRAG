Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:
[*San Antonio Light.
I've been concerning 
myself with publicity
and with good
results, too.  F*]
I had a copy of the book sent to Sigmon Byrd , as you
requested, and I am glad to say that its pre-Christmas sale seems
to be steady, if not spectacular. 
[*I believe, like Cowboy Songs, that after
the War the sales will always be "steady"*]

Alan called me up from Washington yesterday very much
perturbed because it had not been advertised. I have prepared a list
of advertising done on the book which I am sending to him, which is
really rather imposing and which cost us just short of $800. In
addition, we have already sent out over 8000 circulars to important
lists in the music and educational fields, and I feel sure that all
this will bear fruit.

May I take this occasion to wish you a Merry Christams and
a Happy New Year.

Sincerely yours,
Jeves Suteaue
Assistant to the President
