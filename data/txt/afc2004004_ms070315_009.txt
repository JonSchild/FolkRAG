for our sympathy with the "peckerwood."
   Houston, himself, is light brown
with a reddish tint around the cheekbones. 
He gives [the] an impression of spareness
and lithe boniness with all his forty
years.  Loose-jointed, quiet voice, quiet
and intelligent smile. He responded to
our interest in section gang songs by
1) saying he knew some although he wasn't
much of a singer 2) asking why we
wanted them 3) when we explained he
at once began to sing and explain them.
One of the easiest and most intelligent
informants I've ever talked to.  He
brought along a little section of
rail and two table knives to the
interview to rap out the rhythm
on.  This was his own idea.  He
showed [ba] no hesitation about
singing dirty verses--except that 
he was afraid the people in the tourist
camp might hear them.
