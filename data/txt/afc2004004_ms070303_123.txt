the sand drifting? against the

The Coddy, North Bay

It was a Colum McNeil of Barra the piper 
who piloted Prince Charley 
into the Ottermoon & on to 
Eriskaay. This man went on 
to fight in the Battle of Quebec 
along with General McNeil
of Bara + the good piper 
stood by him for six weeks 
until he was recovered #

There was a big depression 
after Culloden + so Colum 
emigrated to Cape Breton 
the pipers cove #

We were all supporters of the 
Prince & she was, too.  But I 
don't think there was any romance 
between them.--
