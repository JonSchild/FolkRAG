I. Military Developments - continued
"If we listen to the Jap reports we'll have to give up right now. They already claim to have sunk 18 or 19 ships." (Office worker, Birmingham, Alabama, 8-12-42.)
"I am glad the Marines are in the Solomon Islands and not just the Army and Navy." (Office Worker, Birmingham, 8-12-42.)
"Even St. Peter can't believe the Axis reports - why should we?" - (Retired Social Worker, Birmingham, 8-12-42.)
"If anybody believes Jap claims after this they ought to be shot for stupidity, not treason. They claim to have sunk more ships already at the Solomon Islands than we had in the Pacific. If they inflict that much damage why is it that the Marines are still there?"
(Lawyer, Birmingham, 8-13-42.)
"Japanese sources, supposedly coming from the Carrier we had sunk, denied the report. But it sounded as though the water were coming up and the boat was sinking as they talked." (Street car passenger - Birmingham, Ala. 8-13-42.)
"So the Italians have developed a new, deadly type of airplane? It is just like all their claims. The first time it was in the air in battle the English blew it to bits. But what more can we expect from the Italians? I wonder if they will ever learn they were licked two years ago?" -(Business man, Birmingham, Alabama, 8-13-42.)
