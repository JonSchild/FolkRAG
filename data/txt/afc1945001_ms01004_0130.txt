In reporting it would help if each rumor were written
(or typed) on a 5 x 8 filing slip, one to a slip. If the stock
5 x 8's are not available, half of an ordinary letter sheet (backs
of mimeographed forms. etc.) should be used. On each slip there
should be the rumor, the city and state in which it was heard, the
place or circumstances, the date, a thumbnail sketch of the person
who related it covering: sex, age, estimate of economic status,
education level, major group affiliations. If reported by another
person, indicate the source of the report. (See attached sample
rumor report.)
