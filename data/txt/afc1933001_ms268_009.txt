Colonel Isaac Spaulding
The War Department
Washington, D.C.

Dear Colonel Isaac:

For your information I'm setting out the suggestions
that Alan made to me the other evening, intended to furnish
healthful entertainment for the young soldiers:

1. Furnish them free or for a very small cost, pamphlets
of American Folksongs that have a direct appeal for
them. Often, one of those boys will know only a stanza
or two of a song. A full text will make him happy.

2. Furnish the camps American Folksongs on records.

a. Carefully selected commercial records with a musical
appeal especially to youth.
b. Copies of the cream of the Librarie's collection
of folksongs which these young fellows have had
no opportunity of hearing.

3. Furnish the young soldiers with musical instruments,
everything from a jew's harp to banjo, being sure to
include the French harp, fiddle and guitar.

4. Ask the Library of Congress to prepare simple books of
instructions for playing all the folk song instruments
mentioned above.

5. Have all the big camps visited by a competent field
outfit from the Library of Congress to make records of
the best music produced by groups using the free instruments.
These records could be reproduced and used,
beneficially, to circulate from one camp to another.

As I told you the other night, these ideas occurred to
Alan as a result of his visits to the three camps to help plan
the music for the White House Program. I feel sure that he'd be
willing to cooperate with you further in any way he could be helpful.
I'm simply passing on his suggestions to you.

Good luck and all happiness.

Sincerely yours,

J??a ?????
