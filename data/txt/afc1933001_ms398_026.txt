And we'll all pray the Lord that we will be saved, 
And we'll keep the Golden Rule; 
But I'd ruther be at home with the girl I love 
Than to monkey with this goddamned mule.

Years afterwards as a train took me into Concord, New Hampshire, 
where I was to lecture to the boys of St. Paul's School I saw from 
the car window a big sign over a large manufacturing plant. It read, 
"Concord Ironworks." On inquiry I found for many years this Company
 had built the old stage coaches (and the chains to drive them) that 
were famous in early western life. Thus I found out about the puzzling 
words "Concord chains" Rod sang for me that windy night in 
New Mexico. "Them 'Concord chains' reminds me of a song I know about 
a fightin' son of a gun of a stage driver," spoke up one of the cowboys 
across the firelight. Then he sang, Bill Peters, the Stage 
Driver.
