BJ TAPE 17, p. 23

Jus' like I'm used to doin'.  An' she was talkin' about it to,
to, to Mr. MacMillan, about what a lie folks'll put in the paper.
She [reckon] read that that woman had the devil an' this woman died.
See. she had been dead 3 weeks.  Seven years had done passed, see?
An', you know, had, [had,] had come.  An' she was dead.  An' when
that she, an' she, this baby died, ah, 'way in, 'way in a far
country, where [the] this show was at, where this, ah, where the Robinson
Show was.  At that time it was Robinson; I don't know what it is now.
Where the Robinson Show was at, this baby died.  An' said one-half
hour later, this woman died.  Back down here in ah, in ah, oh,
out from Albany, Georgia.  See?
        He tol' her, "I'm gonna live 7 years.   When I die, you are
gonna die."  This woman said she had this baby in her lap, this
colored woman.  Said when she, she -- She spoke the word, back
there in the bed, "Put [it] 'im out there in that smokehouse an'
set it afire."                         Never did speak.  That's the
only thing he ever did say.  An' didn't ever day a word, not that
I know of.  (??)
AL:     Those people sold him to the show?
BJ:      They sold 'im to the show.  And Dr., er, Dr. . .
AL:     How old was he then?
BJ:      He was about 8 days old, I think Mama an' them said it was.
AL:     When they sold him to the show?
BJ:      Yeah.  He, he, he wasn' like stuff -- nothin' but other
milk and things.  He was, he was good to go anywhere.  He could
go off a thousand miles if he want to.  He wouldn't nurse her.  He
didn't nurse her breast.  He'd push it back just like a baby that
fixin' to git weaned.  When he first bo'n.  Wouldn't take it.
