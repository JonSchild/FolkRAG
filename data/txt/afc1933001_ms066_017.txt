Dear Mr. Latham:

Recently, I was in the Rio Grande Valley and came across
the following manuscript. With some modification, it seems to me
it would make an excellent supplementary text, particularly, for
the southwestern states where there is a large element of Mexican
population. Then too, the stories are very good on their own account.
Please have them read and let me know your decision. You'll
understand that thesemstories are subject to any modifications you
might think needful. You might think the matter over in connection
with the unusual interest now felt in the south of us.

Sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax
