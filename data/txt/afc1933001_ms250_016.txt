After a month of near blindness,
my right eye is stronger. I
have suffered one severe heart attack
and the doctor has limited
my exercise to [a f] a walk of
a few blocks. Johnny came up
for a visit Saturday and Sunday.
Pat and Susan have recovered from
the measles. When Pat's school term
is over Shirley plans to go on to
Lubbock and get a job.

I am sending Macmillans
a check for $55 covering Mrs. Seeger's
entire debt for extra music corrections.
Those charges are due by authors and I had
told Mr. Putnam, whatever the conclusion
of Mrs. Seeger, that I would settle for
the full amount.
Father
