Dear Alan;

I was sorry we didn't get more chance to talk last
time you were up but I'm hoping you will be able to 
come up again soon. Your ideas and suggestions were 
very gratefully received at the rehearsal the other
day. I will almost certainly be heading down your
way also within the month.

I am enclosing a five dollar check for which I would
appreciate tremendously a small favor. Could you 
send me another copy of the Sin-Killer Griffin record?
Also the portions from a service in western 
Tennessee including a lining hymn, prayer over convert, 
prayer by Reverend Lawes of Austin, Texas, and
by Sister Brown of Austin, Texas. The numbers on these
appear to be 4759, 5177B, [*186 187*] 5193A. If they cost any more 
than five dollars let me know and I will send it to 
you post haste. However I do want the records immediately
because I must be able to write do wn in recognizable
music some of the quality of the church service
in the Lincoln piece so that ordinary negro choirs and
preachers will be able to perform it.

Wasn't Leadbelly terrific? It was almost as if I had 
written it for him. And he is continuing in rehearsals
like a master.

All the very best to you and hope your new job turns out
well.

Love,
Earl
