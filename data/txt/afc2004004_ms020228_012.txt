look at it, since I thought of it now. . .Yessir. . .Same man!
     Then, when I seed [him] the man, I didn'  think about the dream.  I mean,
I made haste doin' the same thing I did in the dream, makin' fun
of 'im. Hum.  Ha, ha!  I said he look like a big sissy!  Ha, ha!
AL:  After you laughed at him so much in the street, what happened
then?
BJ:  You mean at home?  The reason I met him?  Nothin'.  I went
to a -- that -- it was that same man, I believe it was.  It was  
a mess because of the show what be on the street (WHAT YOU CALL?) with the car.
So it was (in Memphis), or [Southern Meth'dist in Miami Beach.] sellin' medicine an' lovin' [Goin'] There's
[down] one to the Point.  An' see, I didn', we didn' [have] like to walk that
road.  Not only that, nowhere without somebody be wich ya.  An'
mos'  of the peoples had done gone on down there.  You know, some
of 'em from aroun' the quarters where I was at?  An' I wanted to go. An' so,
ah, down to the [sho] show.  So I went up on the road.  Ya know,
ya walk out from here, jus' like up to the corner there, up to the
highway, where the quarters sittin' here an' up that -- [ya] I walked
up there.  An' I was standin' there waitin' for somebody to come
by, you know, to go along with, you see; you know, them white boys was
picking' [up] at ya an'  goin' on.  Jes' one mile from there to the
Point. So I stood there waitin' to see somebody comin' by.
     An' ah, an' he, an'  he come [runnin'] right on up behin' me.  See, he
walked on a good piece ahead of me, you know I asked 'im was he goin'
fer as the Point.  [He say]
     He say, "Yeah."
     An' so,  I said,  "Well, I won' go along wich ya, behind ya,

     Said, "Come on.     go."
