In Dem Long Hot Summer Days

[A slow work song from the Texas prison farms about Old
Riley, a legendary Negro convict who left "got worried,"
with the heat and "left".] The Brazos* was [a flood] "boilin'."
It had flooded its banks and [was a reading] was become a little
Mississippi, full of suck-holes and whirl-pools
and floating logs. [It was thought that no man could
swim it.] [But when Riley left with the dogs and guards
beh] 
During the rise,
on one of those
hot days, when the
sun was  [xxx]
broiling, the men
were falling out, and
the "pool-doos** were
dancin!" old Riley
got to thinking 
about his happy
home. He got to
thinking about his
woman and about his
great long time.
He got worried, as
the convicts say,
He watched his
chance.
Riley left [one day] with the guards and the dogs,
"nigger-eatin' " Rattler at [their head, behind] the head of the packs, after
him. They trailed him to the Brazos, saw his foot-prints
vanish at the waters' edge. The guards wheeled their
horses thinking, "One more dead Nigger*," when old Rattler,
pointing his long, wise old nose across the red water, began
to howl. The guards turned and stared. On the other bank they
saw Old Riley, [the] [his stripes [tron] [torn to] ripped] his
convict stripes ripped to shreds, standing among the willows,
silently watching them. Suddenly he shouted, once and derisively,
"Bye-bye, penitenshuh," and [was gone] disappeared in
the thicket. [of willow.] The guards looked again at the
swift-running, evil, red mill-race that was the Brazos [river]. They
watched uprooted trees, [come charging by] whole islands
of brush and refuse, come charging by. They swore in amazement,
"That black bastard musta walked the water like Christ."
[And they never caught him] At least he must have kept running,
for they never brought him back to serve out his time in the
Texas penitentiary. [system.]

Nothing is certainly known about old Riley [besides] other than what his song
[can] tells. We have never talked to a convict who claims to
have [ever] seen him. Perhaps his is the story of some
great slave escaper, taken over by the convicts and dressed
in stripes. Anyhow, when the Negro convict gangs [( we should say
Negro convict gangs, but it seems unnecessary, since the
white men seldom, if ever,sing at their work)] begin to
sing about Old Riley, the guards loosen their six-shooters
in their scabbards and rub [the dirt out of] their [tired]
sun-wearied eyes.

L.B.'s version is incomplete and he sings the song with
little interest

* Brazos river, Texas' largest.
** "Pool-doos," in this connection, signifies the shimmering
dancing heat-waves.
