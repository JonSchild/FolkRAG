Dear Dr. Lomax:

I am enclosing a request for two of the records which you made
of Amish hymns. I am selecting one which is sung at every Amish
church service, the one on page 770, and another one which should
be characteristic of the tunes sung in the minor key. If my
guess on  #1763A1 is incorrect, I should be glad to have you
substitute some other record which illustrates the tunes in the
minor key.

I note from the list that you have sent me that Mr. Bontrager
and Mr. Eash probably selected the brighter and more cheerful
tunes, but I should like to have at least one of the weird
tunes in the minor key if you have anything of that kind.

I thank you very much for your courtesy.

Cordially yours,

John Umble
