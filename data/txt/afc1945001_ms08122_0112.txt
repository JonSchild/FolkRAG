Donald Harrop            -4-             121
            English VI
An allied General just back from
North Africa on leave after going
through all of the horrors of war
stepped into a motion picture theater
to relax. About half way through
the picture an ambulance pulled up
in front of the theater and came out
with the general on a stretcher. He
had been shell-shocked while
watching a war film.
