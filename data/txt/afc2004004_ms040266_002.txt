Dear Mr. Lomax, 

I have been listening with great interest to your present series of talks of Folk Music. 

In the first of the series, you made a remark which gave me the impression that you thought that many English Folk songs were derived from older Irish songs or tunes. 

Some years ago, my sister, who is now dead, completed a manuscript which she had hoped to have published, expounding this theory and very copiously illustrated with examples of parallels between English and Irish folk songs. 

Her theory was that these had been brought into England by the great influx of the Irish labour which had occurred in the 18th century, and though the manuscript is not in my possession, I know its present owner and I feel sure that if you were interested, he would be prepared to let you see it. It is possible that you already know him, as he is our English composer, Michael Tippett, and if you would like to write to him and mention the fact that I have told you about this manuscript, I shall be very pleased for you to do so. 

Incidentally, some of the tunes which you illustrated in your first two talks seemed to me to be variations on some which I know of Irish and Welsh origin, but as I can't write music, and doubt
