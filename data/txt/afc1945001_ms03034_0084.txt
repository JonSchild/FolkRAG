September 9, 1942

Dear Mr. Knapp:

Thank you very much for your first observations of the rumors reported in on the basis of the request in the recent Readers Digest. I am sorry that you were unable to submit material in connection with our recent study, but I wonder if you would help out by letting us have some of the fruits of your continuing analysis in connection with a program about to get under way.

The OWI Radio Bureau is launching a United Nations campaign on September 14. Every radio station in the country will broadcast 10 one-minute announcements each day for six weeks. Each announcement deals with one of the countries in the United Nations (chiefly England, Russia, and China). Various aspects of our Allies' war effort, such as production, fighting, post war aims, and civilian sacrifice, are discussed.

In this connection, it would be interesting to note any trend, week-by-week, in the number, type, and circulation of rumors regarding the United Nations, collectively or individually. In order to make the story complete, I think the analysis should include the week preceding, and the week following, the campaign. Thus, the period we want to study is September 7 to November 1. 

Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
