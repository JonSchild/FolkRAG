            Where the rumor is substantially true as well as harmful,
            it is best not to give it still wider circulation.

4.   Don't imply that all rumors are of Nazi origin.

            It discredits confidence in the agency if the Axis origin
            of rumors is over-emphasized. Better tell the public that
            about such-and-such a percentage come over the Axis shortwave
            radio, or cite particular correspondences.

5.   Embed the rumor in a context of negation.

            Before stating the rumor damn it; after stating it damn it 
            again.

6.   Do not print or otherwise publicize vicious rumors carrying striking
      slogans. Break up the striking phrase so that it will not be remembered.
      The danger is that even though refuted, slogans and aphorisms
      will be retained because of their striking character.

                        For example, instead of saying that a rumor reports that domestics
                        in the South are organizing Eleanor Roosevelt Clubs
                        whose motto is "Every white woman in her own kitchen by
                        Christmas" - better say "Rumor has it that domestic servants
                        in the South are organizing Eleanor Clubs whose purpose is to
                        force white women to do their own kitchen work.

 7.   Plenty of time should be allowed for the advisory board to read a copy
       of the "rumor clinic" before it is sent to press. It takes two or
       three days for advisors to receive, read, and report back any criticisms
       they may have regarded the copy.

8.   Experience shows that only about 10 per cent of the rumors received
       merit publication. The responsible head must be prepared to deal
       with the remainder on an individual basis: about half will need to
       be referred to other organizations (OPA, Red Cross, Port Authorities)
       and answered on an individual basis. Others must be forwarded to the
       FBI; the correspondent told where an answer may be found; or waste
       basket disposal. But the handling of rumors is a time-consuming proposition,
       and should not be likely undertaken.

9.   In denying racial rumors, as a rule, do not feature the race that is
       being attacked. Discuss all scapegoats together (e.g. Negroes, Jews,
       Labor organizers, Capitalists, Irish, Congress, British, etc.) and 
       show how the same malicious talk is heard about each and all of these
       groups.

10.   A rumor clinic must never be used to advance the editorial
