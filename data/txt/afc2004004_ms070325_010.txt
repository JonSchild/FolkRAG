Sunday night.

   I was so sick last week I thought
I'd burn up with fever.  Hell does
not hold any worse torment than
fever waking you minute by minute
through the night.  Nor does it do
any good to know that one is susceptible 
because of a long history of
rejection and repressed crying.

   A doctor who looked like a 
pig dressed up to receive a legion
of honor ribbon gave me aureomycin 
- so I am completely clean of
bacteria including the useful ones
And I'm having to take them from
a bottle.

   Today Rouget who had promised
to go to the country with me, stood
me up.
