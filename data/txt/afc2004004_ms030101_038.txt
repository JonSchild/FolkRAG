Tooney & Delia

O D cursed T
On a Xmas mornin'
He cursed the man a very bad curse
Till he almost take his life,
Cho: Delia gone, one more time
"____"
First time I shot her
I shot her in her side
But the 2nd time I shot her
The bowed her head & she died
-----
Your rubber tire buggy
seven seated hack
Come and ride with Delia to 
to the graveyard
And we never brot her back
-----
All of you great gamblers
Who did love her da best
Come ride right down to the
graveyard
Gonna witness Delia death.
