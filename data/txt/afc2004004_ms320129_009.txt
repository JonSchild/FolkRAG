tape 1523, two French teachers
TEACHER #1
. . .we talked about yesterday about Cajun -
A. LOMAX
Cajunisms, transformation.  I mean the funniest thing, one
of the ways-how the French say you're not talking French
properly unless you use their way of bringing in English
words, remember?  You were talking about that.
TEACHER #2
It varies, yeah.  Talking about (french phrase) instead of
(french phrase)
A. LOMAX
That would be a funny thing to bring in.  But start off
with, this time, just talking in Cajunisms.  (to camera)
What do you think about changing position?  That looks to me
like she's in shadow compared to the light.  I don't know
much but (unintelligible)
TEACHER #2
Zoom lens, do a dental check up while wer're at it.
CAMERA
Those are pretty teeth.
TEACHER #2
Why thank you.  That's a lot of money invested in this mouth.
O.k., French has always been taught in the schools on and
off.  I think the orientation that's important now is that
we're changing now to an attitude, from an attitude, rather,
where the standard French out of the French book which
really meant nothing to kids who went home and tried to talk
to their parents.  From that we're moving towards a
vocabulary that kids can use both in any foreign country and
use at home.  When they go home they'll be able to say
things their parents can understand.  I know as a teacher
of-as a teacher of Cajun French, I would say that 95% of the
vocabulary that I give the kids is perfectly comprehensible
in any Francophone country, but the important thing is also
that in standard French we give them those alternatives that
Phoebe was talking about.  That we tell them:  "You might
here "aster" as well as "maintenant".  You might here "Quoi
c'est ca?"  instead of "Qu'est que c'est?", don't be
surprised.  But also don't be surprised when you hear that
