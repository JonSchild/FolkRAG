TAPE 92 A: HARRY COX
Cox: From me father. . . . .
1) As I was a-walking one morning in May,
I met a pretty fair maid, her gown it was gay,
I stepped up to her and back she did fall,
She wanted to be played with the long peg and awl.

2) I said, "Pretty fair maid, will you travel with me,
Unto foreign countries strange things for to see.
And I will protect you whate'er may befall,
And follow your love with his long peg and awl."

3) Then home to her parents she then went straightway,
And unto her mother  these words she did say,
"I'll follow my true love whate'er may befall,
I'll follow my true love with his long peg and awl."

4) "O daughter, o daughter, how can you say so?
For young men are false, you very well know.
They'll leave you fine things and the devil and all,
And leave you big bellies with their long peg and awl.

5) "Oh mother, o mother, now do not say so,
Before you were sixteen you very well know,
There was father and mother and baby and all,
You followed my dad for his long peg and awl."

Lomax: That's a beauty. Would your fathersing that at home?
Cox: He used to sing it in the pub sometimes when he got among a 
rough crowd.
Lomax: Harry, let's try the clipper - the girl. What's the idea
of the song?
Cox: Well, I can't tell you much about the song. It's got up among
these old shipping people. A sea song.
1) While cruising roun Yarmouth one day for a spree,
I met a fair damsel, the wind blowing free,
I'm a fast going clipper, my kind sir, said she,
I'm ready for cargo, my hold it is free,
Singing fal the ral laddy right fal the ral day.

2) What country she came from I couldnot tell which,
By her appearance I thought she was Dutch,
Her flag wore its colors, her masthead was low,
She was round at the quarters and bluff at the bow.
