Mr. Fletcher Collins

Elon College, North Carolina
Dear Mr. Collins:
I am terribly sorry that I missed 
seeing you in Chapel Hill.  You had just 
left the office for Elon College when I 
called and I had driven so many miles in 
the previous weeks that I could resolve to 
drive no more.
Frankly, I am looking for somebody with 
a good recording project in hand and 
wondered if you had one which the Library 
could help motivate.  If you have, let me 
hear about it at once so that we can do 
something about it this summer.
Cordially yours,
Al  a  Alan Lomax
