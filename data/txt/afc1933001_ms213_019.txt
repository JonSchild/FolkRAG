on her. Perhaps we might well allow
her Introduction to be the principal
Introduction to the book.  It would 
be fine if she could bring herself 
to write as simply and sprightly
as she does in her letters. Why
not type out what you wish
to say in the book and let 
me have it? What our principal
public will like to see, it seems 
to me, would be some of the
stories of our collecting rather than 
the dry-as-dust, often futile and 
pointless, theories of the Columbia 
school of folklorists. Readers, 
they have none, or very few. As 
I recall less than 200 people take 
the American Journal of Folklore
(I have in Washington the entire list)
