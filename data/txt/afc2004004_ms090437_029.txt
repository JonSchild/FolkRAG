have no show; when he get to play [job] bad, you know, he didn't have no help becuse
all the rest of the Negroes you know was taught to obey they white folks.  er-uh I
say when a white man tell me anything - say - er-uh - say - er-uh --Why --
A white man told me once they run a saw mill and the people
had a contract to cut up logs [into lumber] by the contract and when we got th'ough
they sent us to the man what they worked for to pay us first before
they got they pay And the man told us, say, "Well boys, er-uh I'm losing
money on that job."  He say, " Well, I'll pay you-all if you'll take
half of it in trade; I'll pay you money, I'll pay half of it in
trade."  He say, "I ain't gonna pay you all my money; and er-uh I'm losing
money anyhow.  I'm not gonna pay you all my money. & er-uh You-all go to
(the next man we traded with, was Mr. Reddin -- we traded next door to
him and he say,)  "Bob Reddin gets all my money.  You all trade with
him.  I'll pay you all my money and you go right next door to me and spend
it all with him."
Well, Mr Reddin says, when we finished up, "Boys, how come you-all ain't
trading with me?"  We say, "Well, Mr. Reddin, we would trade with you
but we had to trade helf our money with Mr. Banks; the man what we
was working for and we had to trade half our money."  He say, "Well,
how come that?"  He says that the people, the man that we was working
for made a trade to that effect.  He say, "Well, did they?"  Well, I
say, they say they did.  I wouldn't trade up with mine.  I went back [to]
and Mr. Bob - [???] Mr. Bob Clement & Mr Banks says they made a trade with him to that effect. He
 says, "Well, he is a goddamned liar; you go and tell him I said so."
And Mr. Reddin said, "Did you tell him that?"  I said, "No sir (laughter."
I [just] told him [that] if Mr. Bob [say he didn't make that kind of trade] want him to know it -- him tell
[and he said well he did] him, himself.  Mr. Bob might deny it when it get to his face.  I just told him Mr. Bob say he didn't make that kinda trade.
He said, "If you want your pay,
you take half of it in trade and I'll pay you the rest of it in money."
And then our Sawyer at the mill and Mr. Bob he was a saw-filer;
he kept the saw-files in good shape and er-uh he was also the superintendent
