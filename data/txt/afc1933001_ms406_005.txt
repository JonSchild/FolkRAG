MRS. META MORGAN
Several miles out in the country from a little town in North Texas I found a
Tennessee Mountain Ballad-singer, Mrs. Meta Morgan. For many years she had 
lived as housekeeper for her two elderly bachelor brothers. She told me that
she sang all the time to keep from being so lonesome. Although her family was
very well to do, they had no electricity in the house. I drove Mrs. Morgan several
miles into the town and set up the machine in the home of one of her friends. Only
one room in the house was heated - here a roaring fire was kept going in the big
fireplace. A Texas Norther was blowing and the day was cold. After singing two
or three songs, Mrs. Morgan and I would have to retreat to the warm room to thaw
out our numb fingers. On each of these occasions I was particular to open the
door ahead of her, seat her in the chair when she returned - just as I had been
careful to help her in and out of the automobile. She seemed pleased at these
ordinary attentions - though I was not quite prepared for what followed...........
Dinner was announced and I followed the group to the dining room in the back part
of the house. Mrs. Morgan and her friend walked out just ahead of me. As we went
along I overheard Mrs. Morgan whisper to her hostess - "Ain't he  the cutest thing
you've ever seen?" The reasons back of this extravagant complement to me, which
I proudly received, are not difficult to fathom - they were probably pathetically
due to the fact that for twenty-five years or more - no man had paid her any
attention.
