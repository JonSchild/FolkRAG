Reel of October 12, 1961, Side 1, Song 3  [* 31 *]

ONE OF THESE DAYS
________________________
A church parting song

One of these days,
One of these days,
My people,
One of these days
When the Lord calls me home.

Chorus: Well, we soon shall be done with the crosses,
Yes, we soon shall be done with the troubles of the world
We soon shall be done with the crosses,
When the Lord calls me home.

Sister Annie,
One of these days,
My sister,
One of these days,
When the Lord calls me home.
(CHORUS)
Sister Mary, etc.

The song continues, with handshaking,
until each member of the congregation has been bidden goodbye.
