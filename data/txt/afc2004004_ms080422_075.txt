these buses and went to Arlington, and we had 75 along.
He hid, and sent Mrs. Bird out on me.  She came out and

wrong?  I said, (chanting) We want a house like Bird, we
want the Bird in a cage. . . . . She go back in, and came back
out, said, I thought Mr. Workman was a democrat.  I said

said, Senator Bird said foryou to go back to the White
