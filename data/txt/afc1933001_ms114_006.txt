   was one of the Austin women who spoke at length about your
broadcasts.

   Have you seen Professor Harold Thompson's new
book, Body, Boots and Britches?  It is beautiful and rich
and cleverly conceived.

   Your father and Mr. Shumate have gone tyo
Neiman-Marcus's style show "for men only!"  They have
seen several matches of boxing together;  I don't know
whether they think that style shows are in a class with
that sport.

   We are always glad to hear from you.  Let
us know about your plans.  Of course it would be nice to
surprise us, but Shirley or Johnny might be away when
they might easily have arranged to stay another day.
You probably know that Chris's sister and mother have
been staying with them for the past six weeks while the
sister has passed through a very critical time in her pregnancy.
Her baby came safely last week and Shirley hopes
Sybil will be well enough to let Shirley and the children
off to come on down here, maybe Christmas afternoon.

Best of love to you.

   The fall has been beautiful, the woods around here
glorious, though a recent norther has swept most of the
foliage from the trees.
