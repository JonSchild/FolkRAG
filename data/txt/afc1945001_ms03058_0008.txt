We know the proprietor only as "Millie", but she can be
reached by addressing her as manager of the shop.  She isn't
particularly enthused about doing the job again.  She says

R. C. Schoen, Manager
Lyon Drug Store
600 E. Wisconsin Avenue
Milwaukee, Wisconsin

are.  Some other druggist probably could do a better job, but
he is willing and anxious to help.
