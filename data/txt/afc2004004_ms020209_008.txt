[frolicing.] round about now. [they are] Everybody is trying their best to get the last of corn and coo
cotton out of t e field [?] is getting right cold and hey have been at this [now] since september.  [The is [?] for the [frolicing]. the[y] folk 
want to start syrup making [now] and get ready for winter. In the summertime
there are always places to keep cool, but in the winteritimes there is no
place on the outside to keep warm and not too many places on the inside.
so summertime is the time for [singing and playing] frolicing. time for watermelon eating and 
time for peach picking, time for dancing and time for churching. and there is
always time for [fishing]. singing & playing
what kind of frolic are we going to have?
we are going to start the folk frolic off with a saturday night
jamboree at the community center.  this is where all the people go 
to hve their social meetings, [everybody goes there from] sewing circles,
churche meetings, mason meetings and the like.  about 500 people can
fit in there.  it is one big room with a low ceiling.  if it is nice 
weather, i dont want to use the building. i really wnat to plan to use
a hill nearby as [a stage] the setting, with the audience  on the hill & [& perf in the hole] this place is near to an old cane mill
i won't be using any mike equipment nor a stage if i can help it.
if i use the hillside as my location, the jamboree will be saturday
afternoon and thereby i[e] can avoid the problem of obtaining lighting
equipment. 
the program will go from the tradional to the modern.  we'll start off
wth blues and bottle neck gutar playing, then the white fiddlers, have a play
followed by the old men singng prison songs. then we'll hve work songs
game songs, ring plays and limber jack songtest, candy pulling and 
patching and quitlng songs; then we'll start the dancing (this will not
be a contest, but an "all joing" in kind of thing ["]. we'll go from the
old dancing to the new modern dancing with rock and roll 
singing and dancing. i am gonna end the show with an old song that
the whole crowd can sing,
