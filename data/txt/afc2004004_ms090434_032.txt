"Mary Haworth's
Mail"
[?]ns Notify Woman They're
[?]nning Visit Just When
[?]ree Week-End Guests Are
[?]oked; When She Asks
[?]ift In Plans, Kin Get
[?]ffed.
DEAR MARY HAWORTH,
[?]n a letter posted last August
[?]ny cousin wrote me that she
[?] her husband would visit
[?] some time between August
[?] to August 23, the period of his
vacation.  She said she would let
me know the exact date later.
As it happens, I was expecting
three friends from a distance
to arrive the day following
her first letter.  By pre-arrangement
they were coming
to stay a few days
In the next mail I had a second
letter from my cousin, saying
she and her husband would
be here two days hence; that
is, the day following the arrival
of my friends.
As I hadn't the space or
sleeping accomodations for five
persons in adition to our family,
and as my friends' visit had been scheduled for some time --
and I wanted to enjoy it -- I
sent my cousin a telegram saying
"Don't come this week-end;
a letter will follow."
Frigidly Ignore
Her Warm Letter
Then I dashed off a letter by
registered mail, explaining the
circumstances in full, but emphasizing
that I wanted them
to be sure and come the following
week-end.  I assured
them that I had long looked
forward to their coming and
counted on it, and was sorry
things had turned out this way
at this time.
Now I know my cousins are
sore about the whole thing, because
we've never heard one
word from them since.  We were
always good friends before this
happened; and I wish you
would tell me if whether or not
I should write them again.  Am
I in the wrong?
My husband says not to write
them again unless and until we
hear from them.  He says if they
choose to get sore about the
mix-up last August then their
friendship was a worthless
thing.  What do you think?
Please advise me what to do.
E. K.
Woman Justified
But Undiplomatic
DEAR E. K.:
Since adequate accommodations
and foresighted concern
to make guests comfortable are
the basic ingredients of memorable
hospitality, and since on
August 3 you had three guests
enroute and no room for more,
your hasty decision to beg de-

you did fall in diplomacy
toward them at the moment it
mattered most -- did clumsily
cut to the quick: unintentionally,
of course -- by your tactlessly
worded wire.
Those blunt enigmatic opening
words "Don't come now"
(in effect) would be felt by almost
any reccipient in similar
circumstances, who didn't yet
know the whole story, was for
the most part out of touch with
the sender and had just proposed
himself for a presumably
welcome visit.
Pouting Explained
But Not Condoned
Thus with your cousins.  And
by the time your fully explanatory,
almost guilt-toned letter
of apology and "do come"
entreaty arrived, they were too
sunk in moody, mystified dudgeon
to snap out of it and
recoup the glad spirit in which
they had planned the sojourn.
So they scrapped the idea and
lapsed into rude stony silence,
ventilating their mortification
in terms of indignation -- as
many people do after leading
with their chin into hurt feelings.
This is not to justify their
pouting, but rather to give insight
info how they reacted
and why.  However.  "To understand
all is to forgive all," with
reasonable minds; so perhaps
this interpretation of their injured
attitude may at least restore
good feeling on your part
toward them, even if reciprocal
friendship is never resumed.
Now back to the telegram: It
should have combined cordiality
with terse explanation for
asking delay if you sincerely
wanted them.  As for instance:
"Hold everything.  House full of
Albany guests this week-end.
Come next Friday for long visit.
Dying to see you.  Please wire
acceptance to end our suspense.
Love," etc.  In conclusion, I
agree with your husband that
the next move in correspondence,
if any, is up to them.
