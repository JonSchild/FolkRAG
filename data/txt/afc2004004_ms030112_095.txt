Davis used to tell Larry you got to get you a guitar, you got to get you a guitar at that time all my money was going for wine, I didn't have no time to buy no guitar I'm buying me a bottle of half and half, Hombre and all them things. So one day I was walking down Seventh Avenue and this really happened somebody had throwed a guitar away in the garbage can and I got it took that thing up to Brother Davis and he felt all over it and
