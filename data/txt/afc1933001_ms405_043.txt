FRENCH SONGS AND BALLADS
From Southwestern Louisiana

The towns on the East-West highway between New Orleans and
the Texas border, the swamps along the coast, and the broad rice,
cane, and cotton fields to the north and south of this highway have
been until the last twenty years, predominantly French-speaking.
The people still have their own lore, their own patois, their own
balladry, their own music, their own way of life, all rooted in
the Norman-French culture they brought with them from Nova Scotia
nearly two hundred years ago.
The tradition of folk music that this region has fostered, has
received little or no attention.* As always, the townfolks are a
little ashamed of their country neighbors and their country neighbor's
music. The boys and girls who come to college from the Cajun
country are ashamed of being called "Cajuns." Meantime the ballad
singers are still singing their ancient Norman ballads at country
weddings, the fais-dodo bands creating their wild and fertile music
at the rural dances. The songs in this section, the second collection
of the kind, so far as we know, that has been published anywhere,
will indicate, better than we can, what a rich storehouse of
folk music is the cajun country of southwestern Louisiana.

* A notable exception to this general neglect is the work of Miss
Irene Therese Whitfield, Ph.D., of Louisiana State University, whose
thesis on Acadian songs is shortly to be published. We wish to extend
our thanks to Miss Whitfield for her invaluable work in making
the preliminary transcriptions and translations of the songs in this
section. Her collection, French Folk Songs of Louisiana, has been
published recently by the University of Louisiana Press.
