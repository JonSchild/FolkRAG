     In this worl we have to talk a little an hesh a heap. 

Of The Thieves Who Stole His Guitar

     It didn't skeer me a bit. I ain't got sense enough to be skeered 
thass one thing. 
     One thing bout it, I'm glad it happened the way it did. I mighta 
killed one of em an twould a-ruined my reputation as a minister. An still 
I couldn't hep it. I couldn't have one of them barbarcue me. 
     Thass where me an the state differs. 

     I'd go down heah in Wall Town ef I wuzz gon be a stick-up man. White 
man sticks up people an git somethin out of it. A colored pusson ain't 
got sense enough. I don't say you should do a thing cause you shouldn't. 
But if you go do a thing, do it right. Go down in Wall Street where 
all the money is. 

     Throw a gun on me an take what I had. Some people ain't got no 
kina principles. 
     We has the poorest protection heah than any state I evah been in. 
Yit you can live heah easy. If you can do anything at all you can live. 
Yit as soon as you git it the hoodlums will get in too. You cain't live 
in Philadelphia the way we can heah. 
     Naw. You cain't do it. You may pick up mo theah but when you 
git through puttin out you out mo than you picked up. 
     Even if he's a good gambler a man ought to have enough to live. He 
ought not to be pushed so hard he knock somebody in the head. People eat 
what a goat eat. Papah in the street.
