I'm leaving tomorrow from old Alabam,
Don't worry 'bout me, babe, wherever I am.
And if you still love me when I get to Japan,
Just send me your love, babe, care of Uncle Sam.

You can send me a cable or a radiogram
Send it care of my Uncle, he'll know where I am.
Don't tell it to Mandy, or the King of Siam,
Just tell it to me, babe, care of Uncle Sam.

I'll give you my answer, you'll love it, I know,
When you ask me what's cooking, I'll say Tokio.
Keep your southern fried chicken and your sugar-cured ham.
Just send me your love, babe, care of Uncle Sam.

And when it's all over, I'll come back to you, dear.
I'll bring you old Tojo for a souvenir.
Mussolini and Hitler will be meek as a lamb
Just tell me you'll wait, dear, care of Uncle Sam.
