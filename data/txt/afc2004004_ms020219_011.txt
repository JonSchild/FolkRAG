goin' -- Watch 'im [an'] he goin' 'way down to the graveyard.
         See, this, this boss man tipped on down there behind 'im,
the overseer ya know, tipped on down behind 'im an' listened at
'im. See what he doin'.   Went to the grave; went down there,
went to prayin'.
         Well, he wa'n' prayin' to God, see?   He wa' prayin' to the
devil 'cause he thought God was too good [for,] for his, his
master, his overseer.   See?
          He was prayin': "Ooh, Debby -- "  Callin' the devil Debby --
"Come git ol [Masha] Mahsha (Master), ol' Masha wife, overseer an' the
overseer wife.   Oh [DeBBy&] Debby!   Come an' git ol' Mahsha. Ol'
Mahsha, ol' wife.   Overseer an' overseer wife!"   Tell that
devil, "Debil, they so mean to me, Debby.   Debby, they whup me;
they make me work all day, all night.   Oh, Debby, come an' git
'em.   Eee, Debby, come an' git ol' Mahsa, overseer an' the 
overseer wife."
          So he went back an' he told 'em about it -- Told the
Mah -- I mean, the overseer did.   Said, say, "John down there
yonder praying for the devil to come git us!"   Say, "What
you think about that?"
          An' so, said, "Now, [" said,] The devil ain' gonna hear, 
but God might hear."  Ya see?  Hah! They all knew...
Said, "God might hear." Said, "God know he mean it."
          So [they] he was thinkin', "It's the bes' thing we do is better
scare 'im out from down there.  To keep him from doin' it.
"Cause God might hear him af' a while."  They figure, I reckon,
they figure it took God a long time to, then; they didn't 
know.
