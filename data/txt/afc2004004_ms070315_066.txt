Sid Hemphill - blind, creative,
bubbling with energy - 65 years 
old, leader, possessor of many
instruments and many interests
knows 
John Henry
Boll Weevil
Stagolee
all the sq. dance pieces
He seems to live any of several places in
Panola County. Has a onewheelhouse full of downs,
quills, etc., all in [anocla] tow sacks.  He
[lets] lives on a biteweed plateau, woded
gullies pointing fingers toward the house.
Found him late one evening & he played
for two hours. Next day, drove a 100
miles looking for the picnic he was to
play for, finally found him crouching
over his fiddle in a dusty yard, his
middleaged musicians around him - 
Funky Five (so many whores), a dreary
picnic.  Nothing to eat or drink.
