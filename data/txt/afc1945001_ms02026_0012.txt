make its quota one month they never have to make up that
quota it is just wiped off the records. What do you think
of that?"

Wednesday, August 12, 1942, Illiopolis, Illinois.

4. "Why doesn't our government wake up. Everybody seems
to know there is a war going on but them. They want us
farmers to raise more food yet they take all our laborers
away from us. What good does it do to raise it if we
have to let it rot in the field. Last week I lost thirty
tons of good clover hay because I could not get any one
to help put it up. It is just laying there in the field
rotting. These common laborers get $11 a day out here on
this ordnance plant. How can I pay that much? But the 
thing that makes me the madest of all is that every afternoon
from 4:30 until dark there are from 100 to 200 men
over there in the park in several big crap games while
us farmers are forced to let our crops rot in the field."

5. "Do you see that pile of mail Mr. Roberts?" "Some
of that has been there for two days. Thats why your mail
is always late. These ordnance workers started coming in
here in March. Now there are about 4,000 of them. We are
trying to give 5,000 people the same service we gave 1,000
with the same help. Ever since April I have been trying
to wake them fellows up in Washington. They don't realize
there is a war on and an ordnance plant here. We need a bigger
force in the Post Office. There are just four of us now,
the same number as before the war. Why can't the government
fellows be as good as the Wabash railroad. Whenever
the agent over there asks for help he gets it. He has four
new men helping him now. If I could just get two or three
I would be satisfied. It is the same way with war bonds and
stamps. We get the same as we did before the plant started.
Now our supply lasts only a few days and then we don't have
any for the rest of the month."
