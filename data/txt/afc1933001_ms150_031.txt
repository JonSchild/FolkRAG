Boychik - thanx for the letters, the wire, the swell performance,
the note of assurance that you feel re-assured,
and the athletes feet that have crept up to my balls and
made of me the rival to any hard sitting ourang outang.
Therein lies the body of what is to follow - plus addenda one
way or another.

You need more rest.  Especially before performances.  Call
Kazan, tell him what you're doing, and tell him I said your
diction was bad and does he have any [exercize} exercises he
can give you.  He'd like to see you anyway.  You need more
rehearsal, especially on the box.  When you return make an
appt. with shannon allan to have recordings made of your next
performance so you can pick out your own flaws - which are few
enough but you can get better.  We're happy Joe is NICE.

I leave at 5:45 tomorrow, Wed., by plane, for St. Paul.  Thence
to Neb., S. D., Mo., Indiana.  Five weeks.  Meaning we won't be
driving up so we'll send your things tinight or tomorrow.  Meaning
also that Spivak is going to send a recording machine to me
at Mitchell where I can take it up to camp, record any songs
round about, having asked local supervisors to act as informants,
and possibly record the production we will do.  Meaning
also that having borrowed on this months check to see us thru
last month I'l not be able to leave Jean enough for rent, Ollie,
food, coal (which is in and blazing) and that if you'd send
her about [*I hadn't figured linens, light, phone, rent - total is $47.20
(etc to Bess) *]  you'd be paid up including this month's
rent - I think - not forgetting we owe you money on gas tickets.
Jean will go over slips etc. when you get back.  Don't worry
about Eliz. financial state at present.

Also meaning I didn't get the Civic job.  And tho not pertinent
but significant have stopped drinking.  I assure you that it's
not one of these again? affairs, this time.  Which brings me to
an easy role, for me - that of holy righteousness, Prussian
orderliness and ol' man purple ass.  If my indulgence of self
should turn to hardening of the kidneys, your indulgence in
freedom is going to turn to "ashes in the mouth."  What follows
is not covered by the shadow of advice from "afriend who knows
(apracticalfriend, you know) who knows about these things
and what is best."  For the aspects of the role make it a billious
one, and I assure you that since I am going to abastain in my
own way, I WANT COMPANY in my misery - I'm that selfish, that
ignoble.  Look around for a suit - buy it.  Find some shirts that
are comfortable enough around the neck to button - buy them.
The less comfortable they are the better I'll like it.  Carry
no "Dailies" double bulging from side pockets.  This should be
enough performing to gut you for awhile, concentrate on it.  Wneh
not on it - the archives.  When on neither - yourself.  Y'aint a
a jack of all trades yet - why make it look as tho' that's your
ambition.  Walk - don't run, yet, - then be audacious, spirited
wonderful goddamb eagle sea lion that you are - but if you ever
get athlete's feet again and want to go barefoot - goddamb it,
WALK ON YOUR HANDS OR SMILE.

I'm Hotel Lowry, St. Paul, Minn. 5, 6, 7 - write to me - -- love
nick

[*library project has gone thru, finally.  Abel Plenn wrote
