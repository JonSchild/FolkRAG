-3- MICHIGAN

Two Negroes called August 11 and asked: "Is it true I can make [*5*]
application to live in a Brightmoor Government house?"
The Detroit Housing Commission says it has tried to run down
some of the alleged strangers operating in the area with this rumor but
with no success.
The Mayor of Detroit believes it is maliciously conceived
propaganda.
Housing Commission officials say it is either one of two
things: (1) Disruptive propaganda; (2) Efforts of certain real estate
interests to acquire abutting property at bargain prices.
A public relations counsellor reported to a Detroit News
columnist August 13 that resentment toward the Negro had seemed to [*5*]
increase in the Detroit downtown area with the removal of certain
Government services to downtown office buildings.
The columnist reported: "My friend says that he knows that
where Negroes have been moved into certain Government offices downtown, [*5*]
they have set up criticism by sitting on toilet seats while eating
lunch and dirtying up lavatories generally to the point where some
whites now use lavatories elsewhere."
An official in a navigation company office: "A woman said to
me August 7: 'One of the reasons Negroes have been so easily induced to [*5*]
be Fifth Columnists is the promise of the Japanese that if they take
over the United States racial discrimination will be almost entirely
missing. They have dark skins and so have the Negroes, so it sounds
plausible to me.'"
