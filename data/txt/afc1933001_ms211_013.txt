Dear Father:

I returned from New York a day or so ago and found a stack of
letters from you which had not been forwarded. I hope that you
are not worried or angry about my neglect of you, but it was
simply a matter of not having received the letters. The Cowboy
Song and American Ballad matter I will take care of before the
end of the week, in regard to the replacement of copyright material.

Last night Rutn and I talked over the work to be done on the
ballad book and we are going to have a long session either tomorrow
or the next day, after which I will write you at length about what
should be done. Two things, however, seem necessary before we can
do anything.

1. That we know how many pages Macmillan is going to allow
us, whether it will cover more or less than necessary for the amount
of material already accumulated.

2. We must either have the manuscript of the book itself, or
at least the table of contents so that we can make the necessary
deletions and round the rest of the material out with the new songs
that are coming to the Archive. Perhaps it would be a good idea for
you to send the table of contents on to us at once and we will go
straight to work on it. I think that probably we can do the whole
job by correspondence if you don't feel like coming to Washington;
at least we can get along very well for a month or so.

My plans at present are to spend the next few months at Columbia
University taking anthropology and other things, and I think I can
arrange the finances for this period myself. As soon as I have any
definite news on any of these scores, I will write you again.

Give my best love to Deanie and remember me as

Always devotedly,

P.S. I think you should sue the Oxford Book of Light Verse.
