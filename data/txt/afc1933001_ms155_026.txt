Dear Mr. Lomax:
Over the radio last Sunday, I heard a
quartette singing "The Rock Island Lines" song. Inquiry
of the Columbia Broadcasting System brought the information
this song is scheduled for publication in 
"This Singing Country, by John and Alan Lomax", and the
suggestion was made that I write you for details.
I will appreciate your advising the origin
and the author of the song and where a copy of the words
and music may be obtained.
Sincerely,
W. E. Babb
