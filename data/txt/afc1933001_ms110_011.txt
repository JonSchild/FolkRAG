Dear Father:

   Yours of the 15th
 just received today. I did 
not plan to come here, but, after 
reaching Alice, decided to drive
 on and look at the well. It 
is down about 3,260' and has 
had a few sands with odor.
 They are about thru and its
 chances appear slim.

   I go on to Corpus now 
and will be there thru Mon.
 anyway c/o Gen. Del., or Breakers
Hotel. Then will go on to S.A. and 
Austin. I want to be in Seguin 
Sat the 25th for picnic and 
all day of sport of  So. Texas.
