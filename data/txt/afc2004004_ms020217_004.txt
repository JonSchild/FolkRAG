"'Lizabeth," my name is 'Lizabeth you know, she says "Why is it that
you call me Aunt [Lynn] Lena. I say, "Mama says [that] you['re] is my aunty"
 She says, "I am.  I just wanna know has she tole you."  I'll never
forget that. She was just [passin'] passin' on the porch and I was ironin', so,
they learn you how to iron, y'know. I stand on a box. I was ironin';
in those days they start you off workin' early. And so I know, I felt more...you know
I felt within myself that it was real, you know, but I just wanted to
see that man.  Different cousins and things were coming' down from
[Villavista (?)] Buena Vistear and from [Columbus] Columbias (Columbus), to see me, and
bring[in'] boxes of clothes and things.
[*Climbing on fence post*]
AL: He was sending' them? 
BJ: Yeah, he was sendin' 'em. It was true about them [(?)] and all like that. And then they would bring some, theyselves,
y'know, just them.  Boxes of clothes I has pretty ones  (polka dots and stuff) And [then] Uncle John, [who what's] the one that's
[was] supposed to be -- was -- in [Douglas] Lizabeth City, (N.J.) has a drug store. He's
tall. He about as tall as you [(?)]. You're about -- you know,
they['so all] kinda light, some of them [t]here. And Uncle John got high
teeth all [you know] in front. I know that [boy (?)] buggar [(?)] if I see him. He [was a gasset(?)] was gap[ped]s and mine
was gapped Just like my... he talked alike. Named John Smith. And he used to buy
me the prettiest polka dot dress -- that my father's brother. And I done -
oh, boy [my] -- so one day he took a peach tree switch and whipped me [a]bout
(BJ says "preach" tree)
[for] climbin' on the lock. I'd climb up on the lock fence way up on the lock gate lease (release?)
and come down them post[es] you know like boys. And he got a preach tree switches
and hit me around my legs. I fell out with him! for good then. I [don't] didn't
like that old man no more. But overtime he gonna bring me a polka dot dress,
I'm crazy about him!
AL: He didn't want you to behave like a boy?
BJ: That's right they don't like children to climb. I don't like it either. Girls that climb like
boys, you know like that. And I was way up on that lock gate. [And] I'd
slide down, the[se] big ol' posts, you know. Well, it's a good thing;
I could've, stuck a splinter anywhere in me, y'know. Slidin' down
[those big posts] them things; go 'way up there and slide down that big post. The
crowd of us was doin' it, y'know and I'd [just] go up there too [and do it]
He just touch me 'round my laig just a little bit
with a green-lookin' peach tree switch. Oh... I got so angry.  
I never had been hit by him cause my
stepfather  never hit me, in my life.
AL: How did you feel about not ever gettin' to see your father?
BJ: Well, I [don't] -- I reckon' cause
It didn't never did, I just felt like I don't know cause [well] cause.
It never worry me 'cause I had a good stepfather maybe I never had
I never been mistreated by no [my] stepfather.
AL: And you loved him?
[BJ: Oh, yeah bad]
