Dear Mr. Spivacake: At last the machine and the records are
all in one place, put together and seemingly in fine condition.
When the machine got to Port Aranses it wouldn't budge. I drove 
it to Austin where I knew I could get a competant mechanic. He
found the trouble, and it was real and not imaginary trouble.
The records met me here. Tomorrow I make my first recordings. 
Alan advises me strongly to use emerald-printed cutting 
needles, but Presto sent only steel cutting needles. Please have
three or four emerald needles sent to me by air mail. I should 
like to present you with records as nearly flawless as possible. 
Until I notify you otherwise my address will remain, General
Delivery, Houston, Texas. 
Sincerely always,
John. A. Lomax
