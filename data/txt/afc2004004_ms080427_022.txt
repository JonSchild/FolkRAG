APPALACHIAN JOURNEY   -19

[SINGING]
 Over this period of history in the southern
mountains and the southern backwoods there was this gradual
mingling of northwest Europe with a somewhat stark and
sinuous kinds of music making with the thick syncopated
choral styles of black art.
[MUSIC]
     :  I'm going to sing for you now.
AL  The black influence was all through the
whole of southern music.  Southern culture was really a 
collaboration, although the blacks were slaves, they came
from an area where the culture was at least the equal of
that of their European masters.  And they brought tremendous
sophistication.
[SINGING]
They brought a different approach to
religion.  They brought a whole different way of looking at
the relations between people.  They had a different sexual
system.  And of course the thing that appealed to everybody
the most was their mastery of, of rhythm and of music and
of, of a sense of life.
