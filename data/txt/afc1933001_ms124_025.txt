Dear Mr. Niles,

[I shall]
I plan to be in the Eastern part of Kentucky during September
and October recording folk-songs for the Archive of American Folk-Song.
When the [plan] project was first suggested, I at once thought
of you and [our] the pleasant [exc] meeting we once had, (where, as I remember,
you played the dulcimore and sang [while] and I presently responded
with Negro work-songs) and I wondered whether you would be so kind
as to point out to me some of the interesting singers and communities that
you know of in Kentucky.

The [interstes interest] main purpose of the Archive is to record the living
song, whether it has been published or not, and thus to preserve
the [song] voice and style of the folk-singer in some permanent form for [furt] [future] study [and delight pleasure] in the future;
[We are] and then, as so[i]on [as we are equipped to do the work] as possible to make available [the] its folk-song material to anyone who wants
it. We are anxious to [make ourselves as] be useful as possible to [the]
[folksongs] collectors of folk-songs in America and [to, therefore,]
we [feel justified in] ask[ing] their help in the co[p]operative building
of a worthy Archive of American folk-music.

I will greatly appreciate whatever suggestions, addresses,
etc., you [will] are able to offer me.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song
