Dear Dr. Newman,

I hope by now that all the Lomax tapes are dubbed and in the Scots Folk Music Archive of Edinburgh University.

 Attached is a copy of the letter I've just written to John Lorne Campbell.

Enclosed is a note from Derick Thomson, which clears up one aspect of my use of the  Lewis love song, the number of which I've given to your engineers and written about to you. Would you look into the matter as soon as possible, so I can make a final decision and write to the singer concerned? I would appreciate an early answer to this.

Yours most cordially,

(Alan Lomax)
Dr. S.T.M. Newman,
