OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION

August 6, 1942

Mr. Harold N. Graves, Jr. 
Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service
Federal Communications Commission 
Washington, D.C. 

Dear Mr. Graves: 
Mr. Robert H. Knapp is an associate of Dr. Gordon Allport, of Harvard University, and is Secretary of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety, an organization which has been doing a splendid job in the morale field in the Boston area. Outstanding is their work on rumors, the analysis of which they have carried to a more advanced point than any other group in the United States. 
Dr. Allport and Mr. Knapp have asked us (since they will cooperate with us in our rumor study) if we could persuade you to let the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety have copies of the FBMS daily and weekly reports, which they will use to check against their weekly crop of rumors. We are convinced that if permitted to have these reports they will make good and discreet use of them. 
If you decide in the affirmative, the reports should be addressed to: 
Mr. Robert H. Knapp
Chairman, Division of Propaganda Research
Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety
18 Tremont Street
Boston, Massachusetts
We will appreciate hearing from you whether or not this is possible. 
Sincerely yours, 



Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
