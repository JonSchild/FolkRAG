set as a rare collector's item. Do we have 
them.
2) An 1822 almanac, nicely got up -
a copy of the title page of which is enclosed.

I have now about [55 or sixty] 50+ discs
on hand and I suggest you order more, three
sapphires will cone to you under separate 
cover shortly for resharpening and I hope 
you can rush them - although the steel 
cuts aren't so bad. I don't know where
Capt Nye's letter is now but it isn't very
important- I have answered the enclosed, 
telling him that you will write.

I will send you an idea of my iteniary [tomorrow] 
as soon as I have completed my plans. 
With very best regards to you, Mr. Spivacke, 
and the staff, I am, 
Sincerely!
Alan
