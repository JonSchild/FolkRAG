I'll knock it off - 
I told ol' man Eph - "I'll tend to
it, " he said.
Tol' him - "I ain’ gon’ take no druggin' off him"
Tol' this ol' man, "Git yo dam hat &
git outa here, you damn smarty - ain’t
First time I heard of you”
Told me “I’m more in favor of you
than ar’ darky on Hillhouse” -
That ol’ man when they found him off
you’d catch him on the levee every
day- I met him on the levee -I say “Don’t 
meet me. If you [?], I’ll turn you over.”
He took off down throu the woods. Mister
Lambert was a man that would come to
the relief of his hand. He’d pay you. He’d
lend you. Ask him 4 for money, he’d
run his hand down in his pocket, say,
“how much?”
Mister Lambert killed 3 men - he blowed his

I’ve raised hell, will you stand by me.”
We all hollered. Yes, we’ll stand by you”
