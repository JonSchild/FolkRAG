[*Mnstrel routine.*]

You people will have to excuse me for being so
black. It was eleventeen of us brothers in our family and
the older we got the blacker we got. The youngest brother
was named Invisible--he's never been seen . Maw had to sprinkle
talcum powder on that boy to tell where to spank him at. It
was so many of us black children in the family till one morning
paw just got tired of it and told maw, "You better pick out the
best looking, because I'm gonna drown the rest of um."

I recckon that must have been me, because I'm still
oozing around here.

Now there's a lot of people don't know when they
was born, but I know the day I was born , right up to the minute.
The day I was born there wasn't nobody home but me and my paw.
My maw was uptown, shopping. Maw come home and looked at me, say,
"He ain't like me." Paw say, "He ain't like me." You know, it made
me so [mad] devilish mad, I started to pack up and go back.

Just to look at me, you wouldn't think I'm a married 
man, but I'm married. I got a wife so big and fat and greasy,
I have to put ashes in the bed at night to keep her from slipping
out. We got one of the cutest, one of the slickest, one of the
blackest little coal oil stoves you ever seen.

You know, peoples, times is hard. The harder times 
gets, the higher sumpin to eat gets. Take a little common thing
as pork chops, cost four dollars a ounce. You know that's
too much to pay for pork chips. Pinto beans, three dollars an
ounce. You know, that's too much to pay for beans. Chitlins--
four dollars a yard. That's too much to pay for hog bowels.
