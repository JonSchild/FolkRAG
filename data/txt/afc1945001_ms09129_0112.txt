As we'd drive along the road, trucks
full of soldiers in front of us, would
see our license plate from Ohio, and
wave and point to the boys in the 
truck from our state. We would wave
to them, and start up a conversation
in sign language.

We'd see a lot of men in Nashville,
who were having their first meal in roughly
3 days, because they had to wait that long,
ordered by the army. Some who had'nt
bathed or shaved in a month. There
were so many little things, big sacrifices,
what these men were giving up for our
 country. I think its grand.
