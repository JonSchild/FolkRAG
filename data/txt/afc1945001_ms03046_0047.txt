interested in their own political careers they'll never send
him enough equipment where he is to do any good or appoint him
in the top Allied command, for if they did he would overshadow
them."
L. Rumor No. 12 was heard in Tulsa, Oklahoma, August 7, 1942.
1. "The reason why we're not getting anywhere in this war is
not so much the lack of supplies as the way we're fightin' it.
We're still fighting by 1914 rules and methods. The Army
and Navy officials are either unaware of air power or they're
jealous of its potentialities. But in either case it is
equally disastrous for the United States."
M. Rumor No. 13 was heard in Tulsa, Oklahoma, August 7, 1942.
1. "It's too foggy, they say, for us to operate in the Aleutians,
but the so-called foul weather don't stop the Japs."

II. Observation on Rumors Heard:
My entire time has been spent outside of the office endeavoring to
pick up current rumors, and I not only had to make an unusually large
number of contacts to obtain the rumors listed above, but I also had to
encourage and direct conversation along that line. You will observe that
two of the examples were heard in some form twice, and all others
were heard only once each. Neither the frequency heard nor the individual
reaction of others to any one of the examples impressed me as particularly
significant. While it is entirely possible that there are rumors
prevalent in the State, which one person would not pick up or come in
contact with in the short period of a five-day survey, still I am confident
that there are no rumors reaching serious proportions in Oklahoma
at this time.
