Lucious and Willie first played
this repertoire of Blues for me
to make selections for recording.
1. Farming Man Blues
2. Mississippi Water Blues
3. Rubber Ball Blues
4. Sto. Gallery Blues.
5. Lonesome Highway Blues
6.  Sante "Fiel" (Sante Fe R.R.) Blues
7.  Crawling King Snake Blues
8. Stackerlle Blues
9. Country Girl Blues
Lucious claimed to have composed
all the pieces. [For] The best [I]
[liked] tune, Crawling King Snake Blues,
Lucious refused repeatedly to play
[it] again. After I had begged him I 
offered him a dollar for this one song.
Although I promised that the library would
protect him in his rights, he would
not be moved. "I think I can sell it
to N.B.C.'. he said.
Lucious said he had once made
records with "Bo" Chapman, alias "Bo" Carter
