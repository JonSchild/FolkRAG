Letters

I have had letters from several boys in the armed Service, all the boys seem to write the same thing. They like the food, they are treated well, and they are impress that army life is good. 

Homesickness can be read between the lines. things the boys once thought were silly, are now written by the same boys. They want information on very thing that is happening at home. They want pictures cookies, candy, most of all letters. Letters that say something funny, not those written from a sense of duty.
