Clipping Service Desired

We should like clippings which give information about local problems
and events which lead or could lead to withdrawal of support from or interruption of the war effort.

"Local" refers to geographic units of any size, as long
as they are less than the nation as a whole; it may also 
mean some segment or group within the population.

"Withdrawal of support from the war effort" may refer
to direct or indirect withdrawal as well as indirect or indirect
obstruction of the war effort.  It may be signified
by refusal to comply with government orders, expression of
protests, holding of mass meetings, drawing up and forwarding 
of petitions, organizing opposition, failing to participate
in volunteer war activities, striking, committing
violence against others in the local area, and so on.

The "problems" concerning which information is
desired would include at least the following, as reported 
for "local" areas:  any phase of difficulties
encountered in manpower mobilization - for the military 
services, war industries, and farms, and for
volunteer war activities; difficulties in maintaining 
peak war production - e.g. due to material
shortages, priorities, lack of power, transportation
difficulties, labor-management controversies, or
strikes; opposition to government war measures and 
controls - e.g. growth of black markets, arrests for
non-compliance with or violation of rationing or
black-out regulations, failing to meet bond sale quotas,
