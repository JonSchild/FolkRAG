TAPE 85: JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
Lomax: Tell my fortune, Jeannie. Never have had it told. Where
did you learn to tell fortunes?
Jean: My people. But I'd never do it for a living.
Lomax: Did you ever see the thing turn out the way itwas
predicted?
Jean: Does the fortune come true, like? Oh yes. I canna talk
in any of your fancy words but you'll easy understand what
I mean. You take a cut. Oh, you've cut a letter, very soon,
too, and I think it's a bit unexpected. You pull 15. I often
read fortunes at home. . . .You draw 15 cards. I just read them
as they come. You're getting a letter very soon, and it seems
to be under government. It concerns money.
Lomax: Bad news or good news?
Jean: I wouldna say it's bad news because you've got a good
enough card behind it. The red card behind it - not too bad.
It faces yourself because you're a dark man. There's a dark
woman here - do you know her? She has a very good heart.
Lomax: I'm just looking at you!
Jean: Not me! But there's a dark woman here facing you with
a very good heart. You're going to be in a very large company
here, you're going to get invited to a very large company.
Lomax: Large banquet or party?
Jean: It could be anything. A company. But you're going to be
very well pleased with yoursel' anyway. It's backed with good
cards, and you're going to enjoy yourself. There's a parcel
here that you're going to get. It seems to be a parcel here
that's coming across water. And you're going to be with somebody
in a sick bed. And you're going to be changing your bed
here. Were you expecting to go away very soon?
Lomax: Not right away, but fairly soon - a couple of months or so.
Jean: You may be away before that. Some place on business.
It could easy be. There's money here for you, back and front.
You're surrounded with money.
Lomax: That's certainly news now!
