     In the course of my recent authorized trip to New York
City, December 22-25, 1939, I had the unexpected opportunity
of making a group of very valuable records for the Archive.
The informants were a selected group of the artists who per-
formed in John Hammond's concert in Carnegie Hall, "From
Spirituals to Swing."  The Allied Recording Company was kind
enough to lend me a very fine portable recording machine for
the work and from them I purchased recording needles and
blanks.
      The expenses for the recordings are itemized below:
        Blanks and needles (see sub-voucher, No. 1) ...
            ..............................................................................$23.00
         Rent of recording studio with pianos and sound-
            proofing for 6 1/2 hours at $1.50 per hour ......  9.75
            (See sub-voucher No. 2)
         Fee to negro harmonica player, Saunders Terry
             (See sub-voucher No. 3)......................................  5.00
          Refreshments for informants ...............................  5.00
                              Total  ...................................................$42.75
       These expenses were taken care of out of my personal
funds and I shall appreciate an early re-imbursement.
     From the point of view of recording, these records are
the best that have so far been made for the Archive and their
historical interest is great.  From the point of view of 
content, they interest Mr. Hammond so much that he wants a
full set of duplicates.
