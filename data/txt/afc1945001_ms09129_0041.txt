German Officer: The British are gentlemen the French are not.
Onlooker: Why?
German Officer: In 1920 I was stationed at a camp in Germany
and two officers came to inspect (British and French) because they had heard
some rumors that I had been hiding munitions behind the walls. I told
them on my word of honor as a German Officer that there were no such
arms there. The British Officer took my word for it. The Frenchman tore 
down the wall and took guns away, he was no gentleman.

Japanese Announcer: Am velly glad to announce sinking of U.S.
fleet the seventh time of war.

By now, all the Russians should be in Germany and all the
Germans in Russia. Now the war will be prolonged because everybody
will be fighting their way back to their homelands.
[*V*] Hitler is said to have followed in the steps of Napoleon. That's 
wrong, at the rate he's going out of Russia he's following every other
step.
