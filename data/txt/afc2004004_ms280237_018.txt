House.  I've been there three times.  An' I don't know how many
times I come this here way durin' the war time. - to London, but
not 'bout here.  I've been to Liverpool Street station, across the
other way to Scotland.  I don't know half about London now.  I had
a spell or tow in here, in this other place, here.  I come - I come
be train when I came there before.  Once I came by car right 
through.  Oh, I can't...I dunno much about...I can[f] find my way to
that.  I found the way here (pause) (laughs)

Lomax: Do you think that it's better to live in the country in
small towns, than in big towns, Harry?  I mean, for folks in
general, do you think it's more healthy and more...

Cox: I should very much think so.

Lomax:  Do you notice a difference among the people,,,?

Cox: I don't.  I think if you're in a country place, where it's
more open, I think that is the best.  There's one thing, about here,
anywhere there's high buildin's - now about here, when the sun's
shinin', you don't see - you hardly see it.  What do you see?  You
get out in the open, like in a field an' - oh, the lovely sunshine
comin' down onto a man.  Lovely.  You can lie down an' have a nap,
an' nobody to come nigh you.  You can law down there an' go to
sleep, an' nobody'll never wake you up, because there ain't [b]
nobody night you for a mile, perhaps.  That won't do, to lie down
here.  You'd soon have somebody down on top o' you.

Lomax: Do you think people live happier in the country, out where
you are, than they do in...?

Cox: Well, they are - they're happier there what have lived there
all their lives.  They're like people are here.  They wouldn't be
any good there.  They wouldn't stop there.  An' other people that's
here, they wouldn't come up here an' stop.  But they - they like
their own part best.  That's what is appear to me.  Us have have one
or two drift away.  (pause)

Lomax: Course, most people in the city don't realise that there
are so many different jobs to do on a farm, you know, Harry.  They
think, well, you go out and plough, and that's about all there is
to it.  You could them a thing or two.

Cox: The ought [o] to come an' have a go.  They ought to go now,
they want to get a good old frosty weather, an' go and help
somebody to pull some sugar beet, an' see how they like it.
that's all the have had.
Had mittens on, o' course, an' had lumps of old rime, you know, a
ball row of it in the middle of your hand - a little [board], you [know,] had
to know 'em out, you know, an' keep - all ice.  Still
you aren't cold.  Not unless you get a wet mitten on;  you're all
right, you ,now.  It roll all up in there.  That's what they want
