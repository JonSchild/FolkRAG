                  THE ROMISH LADY
   "My mother taught me the tune to 'The Romish Lady' long before
I knew all the words.  I caught up the tunes easy when I was a little
thing.   But I couldn't find anybody could tell me all the words
straight through until I was a big girl, about grown.
   "Way years ago, a lady got bad burnt. She lived in the woods
way up the road from us.  She was burnt awful bad, the worst I ever

rags.  So she got a big bundle of clean rags together, and I took 'em
up there.
   
"Well, when I got there, it was the awfullest pitiful sight I
ever saw.  I was ashamed I didn't have no money nor even anything to
eat with me.  But as the lady saw me, she said, 'The Lord sent you.'
   "'No,' says I.  'Just my mother and daddy sent you some old
clean rags.'
   "If they'd sent a ten-dollar bill, it couldn't be better,'
she said like she meant it.
   "Well, I stayed on that day to sorta clean up and cook 'em a
little something to eat.  Then they seemed to need somebody to nurse
'em so bad that I just stayed on for a spell.  I was going to be
married the next week, but I just put that off; and I stayed on there
