another [one] great, big pile yonder.  Then they, they, when they,
ah, the, the, uh, train thing, hit roll on a, on a wheel like,
you know, hit's, you know, they does.  But they [get] have it fixed so
that they can, ah, back that thing up in there, you know. [know.]
On, on that thing.  Or either them big trucks.  Great, big ones.
An' then load 'em up.
         An' them men load them things up by night or -- anytime they
want to.  A lot of 'em load it by night so they can cut in the day.
You see?  An' that's makin' good, though, [be]'cause -- I forget how
much that they would get a load, but, brother, they, they, they
would, ah, [some] sumpin', hit, it was good.
         An', of course, that had to be done.  That's to make sugar
an' all kinda syrup an' all kinda things.  You know sug-- cane
is used for every thing.
         An' so, they, um, when the mens made good that way -- an' 
still makin' good that way -- 'cause the cane run from, run from
Cannell (Canal) Point to Clewiston, see?  Which is 60 miles.  You
see?  Around.  An' so [that's] it's jus', jus. . .[that's] it's cane, I'm tellin' you.
And, that, that, therefore, all the folks on the Lake just piled
there all the time and be there, 'cause there a lota work.  Besides
the little work in the, in the cities an' things.  Besides
the beans; besides the peas, an', an' all kinda things; everything
to be [gethered] gither (gathered).  It was jes' a vegetable place --
ce'ry, and ah, lettuce. . .
[*GETTING ALONG PEACEABLY*]
         The Lake is a won'erful place to live.  You know, if, if you jus',
jus', jus' min' your own business.  But you will; you know, where
there's a crowd of peoples, it's hell there, you know.  You
know, an', an' far as that's concerned.  But you just know how ta
live amongst it an' go ahead an' tend to you business, you. . .
