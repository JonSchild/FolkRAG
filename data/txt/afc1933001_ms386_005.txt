     "Well, we might overlook that part, but there's
another question I want to ask you. Did you eat at my place
yesterday before you made off with the sorrel?"
     "Yes, sure I did. Nobody was home, so I cooked a meal." 
     "Can you read?"
     "Yes."
     "Did you see a sign on the wall of the table?"
     "Yes, I noticed a dirty sign on the wall, but I didn't 
pay much attention to it."
     "Well, there's where you made your big mistake. I 
might forgive the horse stealin', but the mess you left in my 
cabin settles the matter. Am I to decide what we are a-goin'
to do, gents?"
     Six heads nodded solemnly, and Dave Hodgins, grim and 
unrelenting, pointed to the Lone Pine.
     While the black pendulum swung slowly to and fro, a
yellow-breasted field lark shrilled its desert song. "I never
worked and I never will." 
     As the posse, still riding north, crossed the divide,
one of the men said, "What was on that sign, Dave?" Dave pulled
from his saddle pockets a dirty card on which was scrawled
          "If you are hungry, grab a plate,
            You have my best of wishes;
            But jes' before you pull your freight
            Be shore to wash the dishes
