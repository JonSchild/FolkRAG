GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM
July 13, 1938

 Dear Mr. Lomax:
In answer to a letter of inquiry to the 
Librarian, I have received a courteous letter, under 
the date of July 9th, from Mr. Martin A. Roberts, giving 
me information concerning the songs, ballads, etc. 
of the mountain people, which have been recorded for 
the Library's collection, with a mimeographed checklist 
of the recorded items, and copies of the Reports 
of the Division of Music for the years 1933-38. Mr. 
Roberts concludes his letter by suggesting that I 
communicate with you for any further information.

Perhaps the easiest way is to ask certain 
definite questions:
(1) Are there duplicate discs available 
which may be secured for audition away from Washington? 
That is , would it be possible, by paying transportation 
expenses involved, to have sent to me a selected group 
of say twenty characteristic records?
(2) If it is necessary to hear the records 
at the Library, can arrangements be made to secure 
duplications of those selected, and how and at what 
cost?
Sincerely yours, 
G P Putnam
Alan Lomax, Esq.
