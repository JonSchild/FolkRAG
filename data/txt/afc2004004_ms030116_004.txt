Re THE BULL AND THE COWS: Man never satisfied. God did not promise to 
satisfy his wants, but his needs. But always, when it comes to his needs, 
you have to run man down an catch him. Main thing man needs is 
religion. To learn how to treat everybody right. Seek for the plans of 
salvation. Keep his mind occupied with the things God intended us to 
have, an God will show him his plan.
The weakness of man's strength an the brightness of his knowledge 
is what makes a man the finest of God's creatures to walk the earth.
I'm all the time studyin what I can do fur my people. You can't do 
nothin fur yosef unless you do it fur somebody else first. You can't 
bake a corncake for yourself unless you bake it for somebody else also. 
It ain't worth the effort.
