Tha's what that is.  They calls ["least it] "leased it."   A 
whole lot of 'em call it, ya see?   An' so they didn' like for it -- 
In that part of the country they kinda hate for [the] -- they didn' like
for [you know, a] no colored person [per] to come in that could do them things 
nohow.  They wasn't so particular about it.                 Nohow, 
ya know?    So he just lived on.   An' so Sonny worked with [him] them.  
An' Uncle didn' have his own, his own team, y'know, mules an' 
things.   They was very fat an' good.   Used to live kinda all right; 
tha's the way he lived.   We lived in a black house; we had to have 
it painted; we didn' ha'           up there; tha's the way he lived.  
Everywhere he went, tha's the way it was all the time.
            So, anyhow, this [fight go on] white girl was, ah, a boy grabbed 
an' he didn' -- he musta -- I don' know whether he grabbed[ed the 
[reins] her to rape 
or what, but was in the broad open daytime.   You know,
'course it wasn't early in the day; it was late in the afternoon.  
An' so, ah, an' she tussle with him until she even got the hair 
from his head.   You know, tusslin' with him.   It was on the outside the house; it 
wasn' inside.
TL:         Your uncle's house?
BJ:         No, no, this girl's house.   This white girl, um-hum. 
An' she tol' [him] them -- when she did holler, this boy, this man, 
run -- she tol' him that it was a white boy.   Said she even 
had the hair.  An' they jus' excited; said, "It musta been that 
nigger that works across from you       ," see?   Well, he wasn' 
workin' ov' there then; he was ov' on Uncle's part.   Well, it 
was very late in the afternoon, see.   Her brothers was goin' 
huntin'; she didn' have any mother, see?   An' she was very 
friendly, very friendly, she was.   An' none of them -- they all 
liked 'er; everybody liked her around there; she was a nice 
girl, to be a girl raised up with her brothers an' sometime her 
uncle come to stay with her an' her aunt, sometimes.   But she 
jus' take care a two boys there, like a lil' woman, you know.  She 
really was good.   An' [they]  I have no fault with her, whatsoever, 
'cause she really stood up to [you] it; she [talk to you] stood up to 'em e'en when [you] they was 
huntin' an' runnin Son              .  They got behin' her.  Said 
she was sorry that's who it was.   See, they wanted           her. 
See, they wanted to do sumpin', they wouldn't take her word noway.  
Her brothers told her, her brothers said, they don't believe it was
