(A) (Fact) A certain meat market on 36th and Wentworth
was empty by 4:00 P.M. Saturday. Meat is perishable and
can not easily be hoarded what then are they doing with
it?

(d) The colored race is drastically treated in the
southern state camps. They are mistreated
and do not rank in power as high as the whites.
The white M.P.'s have ammunition; the colored
don't. The whites has U.S.O's and decent [ ];
the colored don't. In some towns the colored
when on leave have no place to do. Otherwise
in outside lands all are treated equally,
only in the United States does this take place.
