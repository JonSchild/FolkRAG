"I heared that they wuz a hirin' guards for the Texas 
Coast -- and I want to get one of them jobs cause I've 
been aridin' horses for 45 year.  I've been tryin to sign 
up but they say I ain't good enough for 'em -- thats the 
trouble with the government -- they always cryin for help 
and turn it down when they get it."
