fromr the educational and cultural opportunities of city life.
        Roughly, the job to be done consist of bringing the amenities 
of city life into the country, to stimulate the growth
of a rich cultural rural community life. Once it has sunk
its roots, this gradually will offset the gross social maladjustment 
which dominates our back country. Once the people
gather together on the new basis, organization will take place
and a normal approach to economic questions will gradually
evolve on the same basis as today the more aggressive among
our people are asserting themselves. 
        This equality in social-economic assertion is basic for 
the preservation of democracy, and it is vital that the lag be
diminished between large aggressive units, such as labor and
less aggressive groups such as the small farmer and agricultural
labor. Unless this can be affected, there is danger than these
two may become antagonistic forces. in Germany, for instance,
it was this antagonism between urban and rural labor which led
to the rise of popular sentiment for the dictatorship. Rural
labor had no share in progress and readily provided a force
backing those opposed to organized labor. It is only logical
that a man must have a part in progress before he becomes a 
factor in it. 
        While the problem is clearly that of education, it cannot
be a scheme of superimposing matters -- rather it must be allowed 
to grow from within the community. It further must not 
interfere with state, county and township rights. This program
is designed to avoid all possible friction between Federal and
local agencies.
