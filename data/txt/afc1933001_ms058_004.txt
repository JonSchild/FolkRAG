4. Some roaring western
breakdowns with lots of
singing between occasional
bars.

We have traveled 1600 miles.
The machine is working
beautifully. We start on
east tonight. After a few
stops we cross in to Arkansas
and Louisiana.

Next address Huntsville,
Texas.

Dornbush has killed my
chances of getting real
cowboy singers from Texas.
Yours,
Lomax -
