7.
Oh, how old are you, my pretty fair maid,
How old are you, my honey?
She answered me quite cheerfully,
"I am seventeen come Sunday." (refrain)

I said, "My dear, will you love me,
Will you love me, my honey?"
She answered my quite cheerfully,
"I dare not for my mammy." (refrain)

"If you come round to my mamma's house
When the moon shines bright an' clearly,
I will come down an' let you in,
So my mamma shall not hear you." (refrain)

I went round to her mother's house,
Just as the moon was a-dawnin',
And she did come down an' let me in,
An' she laid in me arms till the mornin'. (refrain)

She said, "My dear, will you marry me?
It's now your chance, nor never.
And if you will not marry me
Then I'm undone for ever." (refrain)

"The pipes and drums are my delight
As through the woods we ramble.
The pipes and drums are my delight,
And I'm happy with my soldier." (refrain)

Lomax: Beautiful. Couldn't be beat, that one.

Lomax: What do you mean, it's gettin' worse? Gettin' more of it?
Cox: Yes. . .Well, I either weren't old enough to understand, or I
didn't take that much notice. But I have more sense. . . .now things
are goin' on.
Lomax: Well, now, in all of these songs, Harry, all the girls look
like they laid down pretty willing.
Cox: Yes. Look like                                   But I think as funny doin's
is about now.

Cox: Well, I never took that much notice when I was young.
Lomax: When you were goin' courtin' youself you must have thought
about it?
Cox: (laughs) I think that's different from what it used to be.
