I'll make him scratch where 
he doesn't itch -

The seldomer, the welcomer

He'll soon be a load for four
I never saw the froth of your
pot. 
- 
If I didn't knock it down, 
I staggered it. 
He'll be here dead or alive or 
on horseback - 

Lung Sickness - one word borrowed another
For 6 weeks coal nor candle 
went out. 

The flowers in the valleys no more shall spring
" black birds and thrushs no more shall
sing
The sea will dry up & no water shall be
At the hour I prove false to them
