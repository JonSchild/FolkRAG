INTRODUCTION

Much oblige, John, shore do thank you. (You know, old John's
pretty hard to get a letter of introduction out of, but they's
certain good red blood American cuss words that get under his
hide, and it just so happened that I've hollered all of them at
big black limousines with a poodle dog and somebody else in them,
up and down the roads --- so I wrote John a letter with all of them
in it, and he's a using it now as his dictionary. So he
give us this introduction .....)

You know, I got a sneaking idea that this is a dam good book
of songs. Aint a saying that because I had anything to do with
it personal but because all of these songs come from th' hard side of life. Anything that comes from th' hard side
of life. Anything that comes from th' hard side is bound to last a
mighty long time.

These songs come from th' folks that do th' hard work in this
world, and th' hard fighting.

These songs is honest and these songs is right. Anybody that
raises a howl against 'em is wrong as hell. These folks is honest.
That's why they're broke.

They work hard and dont get much. Dont ask for more than their
fair, square, share of stuff they need. Just a honest job at honest
pay, and 3 good roundin' meals a day.

I'd like to know why you dont hear these songs on the radio.
And the nickel boxes in the honky tonks? Why dont they print 'em
on song sheets?

Well, I just reckon that Rich folks own all of them outfits, and
dont want no poor folk songs on 'em.

Rich guys cant hear good. Got money in th' ear. They cant see
good. either. cause they got money in th' eye.
