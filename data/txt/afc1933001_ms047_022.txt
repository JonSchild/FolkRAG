LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
WASHINGTON 
DIVISION OF MUSIC 

You have herein- beforehand a 
statement of facts covering the 
main portion of her letter. I have 
here copies of the two records 
she mentions sent to her and 
advise her as to copies of all 
records and pictures when available, 
In this matter I acted
according to my best lights for 
the interest and good name of 
the Library, and I trust you and 
Mr. Putnam will not blame me 
5. I do not know when I will
come back to Washington. 
6. I rejoice that Alan has not 
kicked [out of] over the Traces. I found 
it a good plan to lay out his jobs 
and leave him to work them out
undisturbed. Kind regards from 
us both to you all- famalies and force
yours, John A. Lomax
