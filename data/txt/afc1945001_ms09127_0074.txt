I  After victory - What? 
Two buck privates meta  major. 
After passing him, one of them surprisingly
hauled off and gave him a wallop on the
chin.  As the major staggered to his
feet the other private let him have
it, and down went the major again! 
After having rested in the guardhouse 
for some time the two
privates were brought before the
major.  "Why did you sack me?"
he asked the first offender. 
"When you passed me, you stepped
on my bunions.  I saw red and
forgot who you were, sir." 
The major turned to the second
private. "And you - why did you 
hit me?" 
"Gee, sir!" the second private 
replied.  "When I saw what my
buddy did, I thought the war
was over!"
