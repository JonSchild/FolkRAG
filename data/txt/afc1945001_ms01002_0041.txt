In the quotations from existing columns which will be presented
below there is no intention to suggest major criticism of the column.
Items are selected in the hope of improving future columns, materials are
chosen from existing publications to emphasize the fact that no group can
be too careful in the preparation of its materials.

       The following rumor-fact pair suffers from the defect of citing
an authority who could not give any other answer. His answer is one 
calculated to cause considerable guilt and suspicion among those people who may have passed or heard the rumor, when he says for example: "It seems obvious that such rumors are being circulated by Axis sympathizers."    
He takes too long to get to the actual denial.    At no point does he specifically state that the rumor is false even though he does end up that they are ridiculous.  
The careful reader could not be sure that in the course of the
procedure described, unfit drinking water may not have been discovered and labelled such. 
The casual reader is very likely to stop with the feeling
that the only counteraction is that this sort of thing is hard for an army [great] 
man[y] to imagine (but apparently the civilian public has a better imagination).

       "Rumor-- Several soldiers at a camp near Philadelphia
        have died recently as the result of poisonous insecticide 
        being mixed with their bread. At a large
        replacement center, poison has been found in the
        drinking water of soldiers.

        Fact--Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Schoenfeld, commanding
        officer of induction in Eastern Pennsylvania says: "'This, 
        too, is one of the oldest rumors of this war, or of any
        other war. It seems obvious such rumors are being circulated
        by Axis sympathizers.

        "'In my 37 years' experience in the Regular Army, I
        cannot imagine either of these things happening. Rigid
         regulations are in force in the inspection of food and
         water for American soldiers.  So stringent are these
         regulations, that the soldier is given much more protection 
         than the average civilian gets.  Army laboratories, 
         manned by trained scientists, are giving the
         solider the best protection that can be had. These
         rumors are absolutely ridiculous."
