My true love up on the mountain,
Bowing up & down,
If I had my broad axe here,
I'd hew [my] the mountain down.

[?] Jay bird up in the acorn tree
Shaking acorns down
My true love [up] in the sugar tree,
Shakin' sugar down.

16 horses to my carriage,
Drive 'em down to town,
Almost break my donkey's heart,
To see me hold 'em down.
