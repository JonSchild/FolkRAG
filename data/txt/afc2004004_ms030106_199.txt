But I very well up on the piano and a lotta the entertainers there
knew me - we had about ten - I remember two of them.  We had Albert Lee
Pickins and we had Ross and Rudser - one of them was a comedian and one
was a singer.  Had Bridstop.  And none of them was from out there in
California.  So they thought it was very strange because I had been
a very good dresser - to come there with only one suit of clothes.  Of
course, after my trunks got there, I like to turned the town out.
They thought I was one of the movie stars - I had so many clothes.
     Well, anyway, on the opening night they had to have the police department
to stop the crowd.  I guess it was pretty well advertized and things went
on that way for quite a while and then the movie star trade started in.
They heard about me and we didn't have anything but movie stars for
I don't know how long - long's the place ran there - long's I stayed
then until I got in an argument with Bridstop.
     Bridstop, I'd known her since she was a kid - born and raised in
Chicago and much younger than myself - but she had learned the art of
the average entertainer.  That was when she got a big bill, to switch it
and put a small bill in its place.  And And I had my eyes on her - those
days I never looked at the keys and never turned around.  I always
looked at the entertainers.  For every move they'd make, I had them,
whether they was singing or whether they was stealing - I had them both
ways.
     So Bridstop went South in her stocking with a ten dollar bill.  I
seen her and I demanded from the boss that she come up out of her stocking.
The boss says, "Well, I'll pay the ten dollar bill." I said, "Don't you
pay it, I want to make her come up with it."  I say, "You paying
it will only encourage her to steal further."  And he didn't want to do
it, so Bridstop know Hageman very well - Lucille Hageman's husband - the
former blues singer for Columbia records.
