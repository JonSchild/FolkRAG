Miss Bee said, when -- see I seed the instrument when he got 'em; 'cause

an' ah, Miss Bee said that the instruments -- They was, they had
these two, these two instruments; they're made with this coil in
it, ya know, like, ya see?  And the two instruments that he had

it with all his night.  Now listen, I had bought three brand new
