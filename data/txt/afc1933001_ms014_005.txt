Dear Mr. Engel;
A couple of weeks ago I decided that while I was strong 
and well and able to endure pain I ought to have some bothersome hemmerhoids 
removed. Thus am I laid up a couple of weeks while Alan gets 
everything ready for our trip.
We start out again Monday. I will keep you informed of 
our adresses. Meanwhile send everything to University Station, Austin.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax,
