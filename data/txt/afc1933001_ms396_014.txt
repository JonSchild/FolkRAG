"You know this Professor fellow didn't know even this much about trail law," he shouted to his mates, "But I'm not goin' to[m]poke my face up to his blamed old horn and sing. The tune ain't much nohow".

This is the way that bunch of cowboys sang The Old Chisholm Trail.  The rhythm fits the best of ahgallopping cow-pony.

RECORD:  Alie Moore - 3954 A4

The cowboys made up a different old Chisholm Trail tune when th fellow was alone scouting for drifting cattle or riding the line through lonely stretches of country.

(Sing a few stanzas)

The morning after my adventure at the White Elephant Saloon, I found an old blind ballad singer twanging his guitar and whining out doleful ditties as he listened to the ring of quarters in his tin cup.

"I don't know any cowboy songs", he said, " but lead me home to lunch. My wife can sing you a bookful."  I held his arm as he shuffled along beside me.  Often I stumbled over the rough places for I was carrying an Edison recording machine.  They built them strong and heavy in 1909.

We found his wife out behind a covered truck, a forerunner of the trailer, seated in front of a gaily colored tent. She wore a gypsy costume, richly broeedddd, and she had used paint and powder with a skillful discretion on a face naturally comely.  While few [?] with her, the old man disappeared into the tent. In a few minutes, out he came. Gone were the round, humped shoulders, the white hair, the [?] gait, the tottering figure. Before me stood a handsome, [?man], alert and athletic. He made no explanation. He was a perfect faker.

My wife shakes down the saps who like to hold her hand while she reads their fortunes in the stars. All the self-righteous fools go away
