Remarks that I hear
War is hell with a capital H.
I heard all the dogs in Germany have been killed
except one and that is Hitler.

A certain person told me just how dumb the
Germans were because they thought America
was starving because everyone goes around
asking what's cooking. - how dumb

People will be glad when this war is over
so they might me with their sons which are
in the Armed Forces and be happy again.

If I could have Hitler by hiself in a room
one minute it would be too bad.

I would like to knock those buck teeth of the Japs.
