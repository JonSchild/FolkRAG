All the clothes are on the way, except one blue nightgown,
which I will send when it is laundered. Your shoes,
Elizabeth, are at the shop being made the same size as the one
that fits.
Mr. Freeman allowed that the " Buffalo Song" was so
well liked by his contemporaries at different Forts, etc.
where he happened to stop, that he never had to put out
no cash for a piece of tail. It all came for the song.
Of course, Johnnie told me that, Mr. Freeman didn't.
The blue chambray blouse has been laundered twice,
but those orange spots on the front will not come out.
Hope our delay in the clothes matter hasn't been the 
cause of any drastic indecent exposure.
