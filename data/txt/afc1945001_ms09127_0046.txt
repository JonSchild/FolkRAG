Letters Home 
My brother is on an island somewhere
in the Pacific Ocean. In his letter he tells the
way the boys have to live. 
The weather is very hot. They have no
beds, so they sleep on bamboo. They had to
build their own little house when they arrived
on the island. Their food consists mostly
of banannas and coconuts. 
They have to write their letters as they sit
on the ground. He has not time to write letters
during the day so he made himself a lamp so
he can write at night. Their helmets serve as
washbowls and shaving bowls. He says he
is glad to get the bananas, for when he was
in the states it was hard to get them. He says 
the women there aren't like them you see
in those Island pictures. They're far from it
according to his letters.
