THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
WASHINGTON
February 22, 1941
Mr. Archibald MacLeish, Librarian
The Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. MacLeish:
After [my] experience in the posts near Washington in recording
the folks songs the men know, in teaching [them others] others to them and in 
preparing The White House [program], I [feel I can] wish to make the following
folks song program [?] recommendations for an Army Music Program.
In general, the program [must allow for and] should follow the
desires of the men. Their tastes can be taken as the [absolute] main
criterion for the program. [and supplemented by tentative suggestions
from time to time.]
There is an enormous and basic interest among the white
soldiers, the youngsters, in "hill-billy music", that is, [quite] in contemporary
American folk song. [plus a certain amount in popular song.] Basic
to this interest is their enthusiasm [about] for stringed instruments:
guitar, harmonica, mandolin, banjo and fiddle, in that order of
importance. A great many of the boys know how to play these instruments
extremely well in the folk style, others can play a few
chords, [yet] others wish to learn. Very few have instruments of
their own and those that do are afraid to bring their instruments
to camp.
A great many of the boys know cowboy songs and other
white folksongs and like to sing them individually and in small
groups. Few know as many verses and tunes as they would like to
know.
[*(over)*]
Therefore, I should like to propose the following:
1. To furnish the words for songs (cowboy songs, hillbilly 
songs, sentimental songs, popular songs, folk
songs) in leaflet, pamphlet, and song sheet form. These 
leaflets, full of references to the historical & regional background 
of the 
range 
should besides contain
directions & calls 
for square dances & play
party games.
2. To furnish similar types of songs on records.
a. Select commercial records
b. Select Library of Congress records
c. Other records to be specially recorded in the field
for the Library for this purpose.
