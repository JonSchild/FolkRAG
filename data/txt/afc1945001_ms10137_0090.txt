H.S. Sophmore
White Female

1. How is a Jap and a pair of
 silk stockings alike?
     One (yank) and they run.
2. What is it that America, England,[and] China, and Russie has 
got that Hilter hasn't?
Do you give you
So will Hilter.

3. Hilter said the American flag 
looked like a peppermint stick. 
 Uncle Sam told Hilter it may look
 like a peppermint stick but that
 is one peppermint stick you will 
never lick.
