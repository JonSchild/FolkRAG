Chas Dralse & group

... 21, 4
chorus.
       O free at last, free at last
       Thank god amighty, I'm free at last

1)    I went down in the valley to pray
          Thank god amighty, etc.
       My soul got happy & I stayed all day
          Thank - etc
                    Chorus.  Well --

L: What kind of freedom does that mean.
Dralse:  That means when ... the sinner, him
that belongs not to the church, & he's praying
to keep salvation & that he goes into the
valley to pray until the Lord have forgive
him for his sins.  Then he came out, representing 
that his soul is free from sin
at last -- through all the trials & prayer.
L:  You don't think the folk sang that when
freedom came?
D:  No, no sir.  That's when the envious win.
L:  Are there any freedom songs that the old
folks sang where freedom came from
slavery-
