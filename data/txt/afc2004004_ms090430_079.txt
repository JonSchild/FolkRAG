uates and all teachers with the exception of one have two years or more of
college training; the average monthly pay is $129.71. In the Negro schools
where only six teachers have completed a four-year college course and ninety-
two have but one year of college training, the average monthly pay is $57.31. (1)

Negro and white high school teachers have similar academic backgrounds
inasmuch as the majority have completed college. Six Negro teachers
as compared to one white teacher have less than three years of college training.
The average monthly salary for white teachers, however, is over twice
that paid to colored teachers -- white teachers receiving $147.14 and Negro
teachers $60.50. (2)

The functional relationship between the Negro school and the farming
system appears in small details of administration. The time for the
closing of the school, for example, is not a pre-determined date, as in the
case of white schools, but the condition of the crop. Neither the pupils
nor the teachers know when the school will close or open very much in advance
of the signal. The landlords watching the maturing crop give the signal.
In the spring and fall the internal school program is changed to accommodate
the system. Chapel exercises, lunch hours, and recreational periods
are either shortened, or eliminated entirely, in order that school may close
at an earlier hour, to let the children get away to the farms. The average
length of the school year for Negro children, including these adjusted days,
in 161 days. For white children there is a nine-months session of 180 school
days, and the schools are closed during the three months of summer heat.
