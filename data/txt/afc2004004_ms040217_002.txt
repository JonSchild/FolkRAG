A phiuthrag 's a phiuthar (Little Sister sung by
 Kitty McCleod & group of 8 women for BBC in Glasgow, 1951.
In the Gaelic speaking districts of Scotland [there are] one can still find
hundreds of [folktales] fairytales and not a little actual belief in fairies,
mermaids, seal women and other supernatural beings of Celtic
imagination. The last fairy was seen on 
Barra by two children [within the decade] less than ten years ago. People still gather at the fireside of the story
teller to listen to tales, [some of which last an entire night] where
a favourite theme is the mortal stolen by the fairies and
imprisoned in the fairy knoll. [In] The song on this record tells how a girl who has been 
spirited away speaks to her mortal sister. 
This record was made for a BBC broadcast and represents the 
flourishing urban tradition of concert performances of Gaelic folksong.
Kitty MacLeod of Lewis, a school teacher, is regarded by experts as the finest stylist among 
Gaelic folk singers, and the women supporting her are all [expert]
folk singers from the Hebrides at present resident in Glasgow. This 
selection and numbers 24, 25, 26, and 27 represent the 
attempt by younger singers to preserve the old songs in
their antique purity of style . . .This follows only a portion 
of the song.
