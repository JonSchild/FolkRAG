and companion in the lonely night watches, his faithful pardner,

"When the lightin', the lightnin'
"Tangled in his eyes,
The cattle he could scarcely hold"

while the cattle were on a wild stampede amid the darkness of the night.

In a reflective mood, a cowboy song pays this tribute to his hoss':

The only way to treat a hoss
Is like a pard an' friend;
Let love an' kindness be the boss,
An' you'll win in the end.
A hoss--he has a heap o' pride,
An' feelin's fine an' true;
He's got a heart beneath his hide,
The same as me an' you.

He wants to step with head held high,
An' courage in his gait;
An' light o' freedom in his eye,
Uncowed by lash o' hate;
He wants to feel his blood run swift,
An' let his nostrils flare,
An' know he's got the precious gift
O' breathin' God's free air.

He may bow down to the spur an' quirt,
An' quiver 'neath the smart-
His flesh can stan' the bitter hurt,
But what about his heart?
He craves to feel a human touch,
He's neither dumb nor blind;
An' he'll respond to it heap much-
The love o' human kind.

A hoss can't speak an' tell folk what
He's thinkin' in his head;
He has to keep his mouth tight shut
Till he rolls over -- dead.
He can't explain a cocklebur
Is drillin' in his hide,
Or say in words that quirt an' spur
Are killin' him inside.
