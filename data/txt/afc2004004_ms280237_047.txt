With his ? and present gale, the yon?    ? did sail,
Bid adieu to all the fleshgirls of the town.

Sowe laid our her onatack, like a cutter [on] o'er a smack
As she rolled from the lee to the weather?
And we kept her full and buoyed, close to  ?          would lay
We werebound for Blackwell in stormy weather.

"UP Jumped the Herrin'
Up jumped the herrin' the queen of the sea,
He sang out, "Oh, Skipper, you can't catch me."
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather
Oh when the wind blows, we all pulltogether.

Up jumped the mackerel with spots on his back,
He sang out, Oh, skipper, come square on my tack
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather, 
Oh, when the wind blow, we all pull together.

Up jumped the sprat, the smallest of all,
He sang out, "Oh skipper, come haul your trawl haul,
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather,
Oh, when the wind blow, we all pull together.

Up jumped the rooker, his back out and tough,
He sang out, "Oh steward, you will burn the duff,"
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather,
Oh, when the wind blow, we all pull together.

Up jumped the crab, with his great long claws
He sang out, "Oh Skipper, you'llrun her ashore."
In this windy old weather, stormy old weather,
Oh, when the wind blow, we all pull together. 

"The Female Drummer"
Oh, I'm goin to be a soldier, in uniform quite new,
And if they let me have a drum I'll be a drummer too.
To rush into the battlefield, with broad sword in my hand,
And to hear the cannons rattle, and the music sound so grand. 

The music sound sogrand, The music sound so ground,
To hear the cannons rattle, and the music sound so grand.

When I was a young girl, the age of sixteen,
From my home I ran away to go and serve theQueen.
To go and serve the Queen, like another private man,
I think you'd make a drummer, so just step this way, young man.

Just step this way, young man, Just step this way young man,
I think you'd make a drummer, so just step this way young man.
