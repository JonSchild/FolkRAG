THE PREVALENCE OF RUMORS IN WARTIME

Purpose of the Study. The study is a preliminary one, designed to discover 
the sorts of information about rumors that can be obtained by Government 
interviewers. It is proposed only to explore the methodological problem 
of studying rumors and to suggest an approach that might be used by the 
Polling Division in a more extensive study on a national scale. 

For the purpose of the study a rumor is regarded as an unverified story 
which is not known to have been issued through any of the usual news 
channels such as the newspapers, the radio, and the newsreels. The 
problem is to learn what general types of rumors are being circulated and
how wide a circulation particular rumors have. The findings will have 
value in two ways: as a basis for information policy which will attempt 
to correct potentially harmful rumors and as an approach to understanding 
how to minimize the occur[r]ence and spread of rumors. 

Procedure. The field work will be done by two interviewers. One will 
spend a week in an as yet unselected city of not more than 30,000 
population in Southern Illinois, the other will spend the same period in 
a city of similar size on the Atlantic Seaboard. The interviewers will 
probably not use a formal questionnaire and will try out as many different 
approaches to the problem of getting people to tell them about rumors as 
they can devise. The relative success met with in the use of the different 
methods will be reported as well as the rumors themselves, the frequency 
with which particular rumors are met with and the alleged source from which
respondents get the rumors.
