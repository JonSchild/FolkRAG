my horror since I rashly promised Patsy
to read them all aloud this summer.
I've never seen her so worked up over any
story - she keeps running to tell Shirley
of new events all the time and she'll
hardly let me off reading a minute.
Chris has just made me a paper
file - just exactly what I wanted.
It will cost about $2.50, I imagine
He has certainly been nice to me this
trip. Shirley, of course, is wonderful fun;
we just tear around together all the
time. And as for me, when not tearing,
I sleep. When I catch up on last years
lost sleep, I intend to store up a little
extra for next year. And so I'll be your
healthy daughter.
Dearest love to both of you and 
take care of yourselves.
Bess
