Once upon a time there was a military 
homing pigeon; And as it was flying
leisurely to its destination, with a report 
from the front, it was jostled by a second 
pigeon, which howled
"Get a move on. I've got a denial of
the report."

A woman motorist swerved to a
sudden stop before the county jail.
"What happening?" She asked excitedly.
"We just had an earthquake," explained
The deputy sheriff.
"Oh, thank goodness! I thought I had a
flat tire."
