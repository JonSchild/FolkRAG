Scottish album can be bought and 
when and how much it will cost. 
I am very sorry I had to go 
away from Scotland so soon after 
meeting you. If you ever come back 
again, I shall be glad to help you 
in some small way. 
Again my heartiest congratulations 
and thanks for what you have done 
for our country. I was most touched 
by your tribute to the people of 
the Hebrides. 
Yours ever, 
Calum Maclean
