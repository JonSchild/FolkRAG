Mr.George Lee Kramer
21 Seventh St., S. W.
Winter Haven, Fla.

Dear Mr. Kramer:
     You can obtain a copy of Peter Grey which is the name 
of the song your dad used to sing by writing to ______________ 
collection at Brown University Library. They have brought out a 
series of reprints of early American songs and this is in that 
series. Do you happen to remember other songs your father sang of 
the same type, - songs of Reconstruction Days or Railroad building? 
If you do recall any and even if they're fragmentary, I'd greatly 
appreciate your sending them to me to be added to the collection 
here in the Library.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
