Davy: Yes I am a lot. Yes Indeed. Far better, because when you're
running here and running there, you're no giving the children a 
proper education and it's cold, and children ill. My younger
days - I got hardened. Children now like the same. Brought up
properly. My girl's got good education. Wonderful. And she'll
be going to school shortly, the youngest one. She'll be five in
October. But the other girl, Mary, she'sa great scholar. And Jean
is a good scholar. The oldest girl, she's nineteen past.
Lomax: Tell me about your travelling days in Ireland, and things
that happened to you and places you went and people you knew.
Davy: Well, I remember one time I went away from the wagon to
play a town, and a couple of Irishmen says to me, "See, Jock,
would you like to come and play for an all night hooley?" Now
that was in the six counties, County Down, at a place called
Warm Point, not far from the Mountains of Mourne. But, however,
I goes back and tells my wife. Next morning, these two men come
out with a car for me and took me away about 25 miles to the
mountains to a farmhouse, and we went to the farm, and it was way
down an old road. I says to one of the Irishmen, "Is it a dance?"
"No," he says, "It's an all-night hooley, and there'll be plenty
of booze there and they'll dance."
     So I went in and the man give me a couple, three bottles of
stout and some whiskey, and he said, "Now you'll have to sing
the boys a few old Scotch songs and some tunes. Do you play
Irish tunes?" I says yes. So I started to play and sing about
seven o'clock at night, and there were people coming and gathering
from the mountainside to this farm - drinking. I don't know what
they call it in Ireland -- it was a place like a pub inside,
whiskey and drink and all in this farm. But I was there all
night anyway, and I got a bit too far on now with drink. I was
playing jigs and reels and hornpipes. There was a fiddler there,
an Irish fiddler, but he wasn't a tinker at all. He was one of 
the country boys, a good fiddler. . .. So I finds meself in the 
morning lying on the floor - a coat over me, and I was very sick.
And I looked across, and he was in bed, an old man lying in the 
bed. Two other young fellows put him there. It'd be about seven
in the morning. So I started coughing, and the old man wakened and
says, "What is wrong with you? What is your name?"
"O" says I, "I'm the Scotchman that was playingnhere last night
with the accordian."
"I thought I heard some music," he says, "But I wasn't very sure
who was playing the accordion. Maybe you had too much last night
to drink."
I says, "Yes, I had a bit too much."
He says, "IT's my son, you know, that's running this hooley. It's
too early i n the morning for you to get up. However," he says,
some of the girls'll be going about the farm - they'll give you a 
cup of tea."
