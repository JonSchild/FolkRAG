Aizan,-o laisse coule,
Ce moin dit pou' ca,
Si m' tombe, m''a leve dos a dos,
Si m' tombe, m''a leve dos a dos.

Aizan, ce-vo-why-e,
Aizan, let it go*,
So far as I am concerned,
If I fall,
I'll get up back to back.**

The next song was a gay dance for Aizan, with a drum
rhythm called Dahomey.

Aizan, Aizan,
O Aizan marche,
Aizan-o,
Aizan pr'alle promene.

Aizan marches,
Aizan is going to parade.

As if Aizan had come to a bountiful ceremony and were bragging
on himself, the next song, a Dahomey(?), says,

Aizan, dos l'he-l'he, dol'he-l'he,
Nous 'river,
Jeune gens capab', moin,
Dos-l'he-l'he, dos-l'he-l'he,
Dos-l'he-l'he, borde, moin, 
Aizan, dos-l'he-l'he, dos l'he-l'he,
Nou'   'rive.


* One of Aizan's attributives.
* Herskovitz, page 172, 'Life in a Haitian Valley", translates this
"permit coiling", which doesn't make any sense to me.
** See diagram on card, leve dos a dos.
