        An' see.  An', an', an' like it's goin' an' like it is goin',
ah' ah, an' like I desires for it to go.  Even if I hadn't a-had
records, I'd go from church to church an' diffrunt programs.  You
see, you, you, everytime you go in [your church ya git a] these churches, the program
is written out.   An' somebody got 'em, where they stamped, from
the place that we go have 'em stamped at.  These folks keep a 
copy of that.  'Cause we can go back right now, until the first
program we ever had, an' to the printin' office, an' they'll show
us just what happened.   Ya see, just who it was.  Well, I figure
that was a great life.  You you know, there's somethin' alive yet;
my name is, my name is on the program.  You see?   An' so that
was sumpthin' that I, I feel good about, bein' alive, y-you know.
Ah, ah, without, among the peoples, an' somewhere else.   Just like,
[like] I sit an' read about somebody or hear about somebody, you
know?   And I look on the program and see about diffrunt one's
names on there.  That's great, to me.   'Cause they're here, ya
see?   An' I got some program in there now from, you know, our
Church's.   I can look on it an' see the names on there.   They
was, they was standin' for sumpthin'.   They was doin' sumpthin'.
An' so that's what I, [mean] that's what I mean.  Just be in the
world straight...
