Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

   Thank you for your letter of January 25th.  Do you have
any list of the Dutch Guiana recordings by Mrs. Nicol Smith?  I
would like to have a representative collection but feel 28 is more
than I need.  Could you pick out 12 of the best ones, or do you
feel each is so different that I should have them all?  I am somewhat
limited as to storage space.

   Also, do you have any list of the other South American
recordings or the North American Indians?  I had hoped it might be
possible for me to come to Washington to select them, but at present
this does not seem to be feasible.

Sincerely yours,

Hazel L. Muller
