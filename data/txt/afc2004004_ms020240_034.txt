BJ TAPE 26, p.32

They don't wanna buy nothin'; they see you stan' there waitin' to
buy somethin'; they standin' right there an' the man lookin' at
them, the man wanna, the man wanna wait on you an' they hate to
driver her out, an' hate to turn her loose.  Mens don't do it.
White mens don't do it, but a white woman'll do it, brother, in
that South.  They'll stan' right there an', an' hold a conversation,
about sumpin'.  Jus' hold a conversation.  Knowin' that you waitin'
to, to get waited on.  You see?  It's awful.
An' sometime I jus' walk of an' leave 'em.  But that make that
man lose his customer.  See?  An' that makes him lose it.  I hear
'em talkin' about it sometimes.  "She just stood right there an'
talked.  She just made me sick.  I was in..."  An' it makes them,
them peoples don't like it, ya know?  You know, the peoples what
sellin'.  'Cause they got a bad habit of it, some of 'em.  Now,
those what know me, ya know, if they know me, they don't do that.
Ya see, but some of 'em -- I seen a lot of 'em do it.  An' I can't
stand it.  Turnin' side, ah, back like, like that to ya, an' git
in a regular conversation; kinda cut down a lil' -- I walk
right out; I'm gone.  See?
But they doin' it to to look like to say, "Well, you can wait
'till I git through talkin'."  You see?  Now, if you don't wait
there, they'll look atcha up an' down, jus' like if you a mule or
sumpin'.  If you jus' stand there..."I got to go; I ain't got time 
to wait on you."  I walk right on out [the door]; I'm gone.  But a lot of folks
doesn't.  "I wanted to git so-an'-so at that certain place,"ya know,
sometime.  An' they be...Ya see the man:  "Yes'm, that's right,"
an' he tryin' to git things -- Ya see he wan', he wan' 'em to leave,
ya know?  An' but they jus' won' go, just act -- "An' so-an'-so-an'
so.  An' so-an'-so."  An' they aint want nothin', not nothin'.  Act
