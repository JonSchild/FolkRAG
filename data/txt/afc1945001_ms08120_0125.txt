On Experience
I have a brother in camp Walter
Was, he sent me one of the camp newspapers
[W]which told of the boys activities in camp.
Christmas day the men did many things
and went many places.
The part I liked best maybe because
it is about my brother is a little colum 
that read
Did you notice Sergent Reed
and acting Sergent Johnson
had [c?????] standing after
that long [h????] ride?
