Coisich, a ruin.
p.36 "Orain Luaidh".

Walk, dear one, fair-armed one,
Bear a greeting to Harris
To John Campbell with the brown hair, my sweetheart.
Often I lay under your cloak.
Still 'twas not on the townland-
In a lonely hollow in the brushwood glade,
Your arm under my head your coat over me
And I under the skirt of your chequered plaid,
The wind of the high mountains scuddling past,
Pure water cool and refreshing
From the tongue of the deer that bells.
Wet is the day and cold it is,
And the MacNeils have put to sea.
If I speak truth, I can see them
With their ships bare and swift,
With their chains round and hard,
With their banners blue and green.
A betrothal tonight in the upper village,
Goats' eyes in the heads of the young women.
And if I can I shall make profit.
If I should hear another speaking to you,
I should pluck out the roots and ends of my hair,
My nose would spout as high as the house,
My breath would go out in a green haze.
You are the man I love best,
That ever trod on grass or braird (i.e. young corn)
That ever lay on his left or right side
Or put shoe on his foot
You are my sweet honey, my bees' honey,
My flowers amid the corn.
You are my music, my music, my violin music
And my harp music high and low.
How I am distracted
Since the first of March in the beginning of Spring -
My brown-haired young man is unwell.
There is no need of doctor in your house.
Nevertheless there is need of linen
And of many, many white tapers.
I spent last night at the wake
And I shall spend tonight too there
Till earth is heaped on the eye of my beloved,
Earth on the eye of my secret first-love.
