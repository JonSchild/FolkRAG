Macmillans, 60 Fifth Ave.

Dear Mr Strunk:
At the last moment 
Alan and I were detained unavoidably
here, and so will not be able to 
use the tickets you kindly had 
sent to us

I have left Wilton. Here is a
receipt showing that I paid the 
charges on the recording machine.
This may help you then in securing
a refund of the money.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax

We will see you shortly
