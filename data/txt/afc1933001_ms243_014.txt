I think we should have a
substantial cut-in from the
proceeds of his album. And
you had better be sure that
Columbia wont make trouble
about our use of "Darling
Corey" and "Peter Gray" on which
they seem to hold prior
copyright.
Affectionately,
Father
I have made no reply 
to Columbia. Please return
the letter with your answer
and copies of any letters
that you write about the
matter.
