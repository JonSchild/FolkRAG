BATSON

Batson been working for Mr. Earle,
Six [Seven] long years today
And ever since he been working for Mr. Earle
He never got [no]a pay.

Refrain:
Cryin', Oh mama, 
Haven't done the crime.  [*Chorus also, often didn't done the crime*]

Batson asked Mr. Earle,
["]Can he take a walk,["]
Mr. Earle answered Batson,
"You can go and come right back."

Batson hitched up Mr. Earle's 
Two bay horse and a wagon,
[*?*] Tuck it back up town
To get him a load of feed.

When he got back to the house,
Onhitched those two bay mares
And he walked on back up town
See something he really liked.

He was walking down Ryan street
Looking down [so gay]in the showcase, 
He thought he had something, ? [*he'd have*]
[*This ? thing*] Something what he really need.

'Bout the time he was looking in the sho-case
Here come Mr. Henry Reese,
Mr. Sherriff, police come a-walkimg
Throwe d two forty-fives in his face.

Mr. Henry Reese' deputy come a-runnin',
Slapped him across the face,
Says, "Stick 'em up, Batson,
For we constitute you under arrest." (?)

Batson asked Mr. Henry Reese,
"What you arresting me for?"
Says, "That's all right, Batson,
You know all [*?*] about it yourself."

[Batson]'Rested poor little Batson,
They took him to the county jail
And then the people begin to gather 
From miles and miles around.
