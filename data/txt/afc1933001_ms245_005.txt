But we'll be on our way in
a week or ten days.
4. I shall go on with my
trip with Frank Goodwin
and use Franks converter.
5. Thank you for all your
suggestions. I'll follow up
all that I can
6. I'm having the machine
thoroughly overhauled. In a 
day or so I'm going over to
the Fort Worth Stock Yards
and make records of all
the cattle calls used in handling
stock.
7. I know nothing of your
Brownie McNeil. I don't
think Goodwyn and I will
likely duplicate any of his
stuff.
