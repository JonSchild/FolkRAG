Rumor Reporting
                      The first responsibility of a rumor-control project is,
therefore, the collection and analysis of rumors. In order to have
a truly representative collection and analysis of rumors, rumor-
control groups should have representatives of civil clubs, different
religious denominations, unions, minority groups, educators,
professional men. In a large community, it is desirable to have
skilled persons who devote themselves to the systematic reporting
of rumors; in a small community, they are probably not necessary.
Rumor reports are most useful if submitted in writing, signed by
the reporter. The signature is simply a testimony of good faith;
the names of reporters should never be disclosed. Experience shows
that rumor reports should not be accepted (or encouraged) over the
telephone: first. because the use of the telephone exaggerates
the seriousness of the rumors and second, because the telephone
encourages spontaneous conversation about the rumor instead of considered
analysis of the total body of rumors.
