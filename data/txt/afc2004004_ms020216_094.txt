"I got rid of it."  But yet I heard her say she's a Christian.
Well, she's, say that. . .Well, all [the] depend -- you know the
powder in the bread (baking powder to make bread rise)?   When
there ain't no powder in the bread?   You put those stove an'
there ain't no powder in it?   It flat, don't it?   "Everything
flat with me."   She here in New Yawk now.  "It jus' flapped out."
         Said to myse'f, [I say,] "Well, you can say what you please, but you's a
hell-bound Christian !  Jus' as sho' as you're born.   'Cause
that' innocent blood an' you had no business to take it."  See?
Jus' as sho's you bo'n.   [Ah, ah,]
         Uh, ah, my pastor, first pastor, that I, ah, come in Holiness
with.   I ain' never had but two pastors, Elder Winn (Wayne?)
and Elder Hunter.   His mother -- he, he was the on'y boy she had
an' she had two children, a boy and a girl -- He was a won'erful
preacher.  An' his mother -- He was tryin' to get her to git --
to seek.   She was seekin' (SEEKING THE HOLY GHOST) the same time
I was an' many more of 'em.   But that ol' lady was seekin' an'
she really, she, she went out fer it.  Look like sometimes she
get so close to the Holy Ghost it look like, if I could, I could
just[, just] push it in 'er, you know?   She[would]  git so close, it
look like, you, you know.   You, you can tell when you're seekin';
anybody know about it.  When a person's really goin' [on] an' mean
it.   An' it look like the Lawd jus' so close there, He jus', jus'
carryin' (?).   I said, "Lawd, if I could, jus' one more, do
sumpin'."   There's sumpin' gotta be done; I don't know what it is.
