ANY ONE WILL DO

A maiden once, of certain age,                   "Oh, give! A husband Give!" she cried
To catch a husband did engage;                 "While yet I may become a bride;
But, having passed the prime of life           Soon will my day of grace be o'er,
In striving to become a wife                         And then like many maids before,
Without success, she thought it time         I'll die without an early love,
To mend the follies of her prime.               And none to meet me there above!

Departing from the usual course                   "Oh, 'tis a fate too hard to bear!
Of paint and such like for resource,               Then answer this my humble prayer,
With allher might this ancient miad               And oh, a husband give to me!"
Beneath an oak-tree knelt and prayed;         Just then the owl from the tree,
Unconscious that a grave old owl                   In deep base toner cried, "Who-who-who
Was perched above--the mousing fowl!        "Who Lord? And doust thou ask me       
                                                                              who?
                                                                              Why anyone, good Lord, will do!"

THE FARMER'S WIFE

This reading is a tribute and a recognition to the Mother who is a farmer's
wife.

Up in the morning at four o'clock
An hour ahead of the Plymouth Rock"
Breakfast to get, the eggs to turn,
A farmer's wife her salt does earn,
Dishes to wash, the bread to set.
The beds to make, rock the bassinet;
The floor to sweep and then to mop,
Keeps her going without a stop;
Lunch to pack for kiddies three,
Who skip away in childish glee;
The baby to bathe, bread to knead,
The carrots to hoe, the onions to weed,
Butter to churn, a pie to bake;
Hush. There! The baby's awake!

Dinner to get for hungry men
Who appetites thrive on oxygen;
Spuds to peel, meat to fry,
Gracious how that bow does cry;
Oh, well! Between the dawn and setting sun,
There should be time to get all done.
The same old round, the same work to do,
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, too.
It's a great old life, if one's got grit,
For oftentimes you'll want to quit.
