You can sing these little no-harm, and
you don't mean it-you can get out
there and sing Christian songs and they'll
pass you on by - but when you get
out there and holler-
"All I've got is a worried mind"
they'll like it - I won't ever sing 'em
less they asks me.
You can't find it in the Bible these is Blues in
Heaven.   Lord give you honey & wine -
won't have to be hungry & and thirsty
Every day be Sunday - When you leave
this old mortality, you'll see with a 
spiritual eye.

I've sung in quartet whenever they call me - I
sing base.  Likes to sing in congregation 'cause
[I] a man can get a chance to catch a little air.
