         for Dr. Spivacke

April 17, 1939

Dear Dr. Keppel:
As to the project for further development and utilization of our Archive of American Folk Song:
Dr. Stevens informs me that the Rockefeller Foundation could not share in the budget (totaling $39,500) suggested.  In view, therefore, of the paragraph in your note of March 28, we shall, I suppose, to our regret have to postpone our ambition in the matter.
Dr. Spivacke, sharing my disappointment, wonders whether a grant might not be possible for the outlay (about $15,000) upon the plant alone, since this sum would represent only a little over a third of the total, and the apparatus would in any case require nearly a year to assemble.
Cordially, yours,

Dr. Frederick F. Keppel,
Carnegie Corporation of New York,
522 Fifth Avenue,
New York City
