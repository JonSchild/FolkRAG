[*59*]up when they arrived back in Chicago because of
arguments. There was an argument all the time with
Keppard's big talk. He was mostly kidding all the
time. Morgan Prince, from a different section, took
Keppard seriously and always thought Freddie wanted to break
up the band. He would always say, "Let them wait for me,
the band can't play until I get there". Through these
arguments in the city of Chicago, Morgan Prince hit
Freddie Keppard across the head with a cane - that started
breaking up the band. I don't know when they disbanded but
it was beginning to end.

        Dixieland Combination - Freddie Keppard and His
        Tuxedo Orchestra

        Tuxedo was a ball-room and saloon, in other words
it was a high class honky-tonk. A barrel house was a
very low caliber place. Tuxedo was located on Franklin
Street between Bienville and Custom House. This was in
the heart of the tenderloin district. I was there when
the place was built. Billy Phillips was right across
the street.

        Both of these men had regular New Orleans combinations
without piano - violin, guitar, bass violin, clarinet, 
trumpet, trombone and drums. Business was bad
at the Tuxedo after the killing of Billy Phillips by
Lefty Louie's gang of New York.

        Only blues was played in the honky-tonks. Street
bands played only strict marches.
