Coatapa, near Livingston

My dear Reverand Hall:

    The Library of Congress makes a charge of $1.50 for a
record cut on both sides. You and your son sung ten songs and
you made a prayer, making aleven items in all which are as follows.

1. Going Home on the Morning Train
2. Plum the Line
3. I Wonder Where in Heaven You Will Find Me
4. I'll Be Glad When the Roll is Called
5. Old Time Religion
6. When Trouble's in My Home
7. Prayer
8. Precious Lord, Hold My Hand
9. Jubilee
10. Waiting on You
11. Drinking Wine

    I think you'll understand from the foregoing paragraph that
four songs on one record will cost $1.50. You can order as many
records as you'd like and make any selection of songs you like. Make
your money order or check payable to the Music Division, Library of
Congress.

    I think I can have your records ready for you within a reason-
able period.

    Sincerely yours,
    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Curator of Folk Songs
    Archive of American Folk Songs
    Library of Congress
