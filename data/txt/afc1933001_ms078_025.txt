Professor Jo Siah Coombs
Texas Christian University
Fort Worth, Texas

Dear Professor Coombs:

    Alan Lomax will be on the program at the meeting of
the Texas Folk Lore Society to be held in San Antonio the
first week in May. If you wish him to come by and sing and
talk about Folk Songs to a Fort Worth audience, he will be
available, either just before he speaks at San Antonio, or
immediately thereafter. It is only incidental that Alan is
my son. I do not think that fact influences my judgment when
I tell yo that he puts on a grand show. His youth and personal-
ity, his charming ability to sing folk songs as they should be
sung and the wide variety that he is able to offer, all combine
to put his show over. I guarantee that he will not disappoint
you. His fee is $100.00 for one engagement.

    Give my best regards to the dear and beautiful lady
who presides over your home.

    Sincerely yours,
    Honorary Curator and Consultant
    Archive of Amer. Folk Songs
    Librarynof Congress
