come to a boil, you know, like, you know, an' then fix 'em up.  Put the
little season in it an' everything an', further, they was
supposed to cook 'em.  An' then they um, ah, would turn the,

down all night, an' like that.  But, but they always would
cook it again, in the jar, see.  An' I do it, too, [Cook] sometime
