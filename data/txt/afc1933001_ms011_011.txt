Dear Mr Engel:

Our recent trip to South Texas
convinces me that our work will
be greatly helped if we had the additional
equipment necessary to operate your
machine both by direct and by alternating 
current. Another appliance will enable
us to fill our batteries without delay or
expense. Then we should have convenient caps
built into our car so as to carry the
various parts of the recording machine
without damage, and with much added convenience.
If my to request could be
added $250, the sum would be ample.
Merry Christmas and Thanks, John A. Lomax
