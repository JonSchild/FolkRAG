Mr. R. Keith Kane, Chief, Bureau of Intelligence    October 15, 1942
Eugene Katz, Chief, Special Services Division
Letter from Dr. Allport, dated October 8th

Attached is a copy of a letter just received from Gordon
Allport, in criticism of the Wartime Rumor Report.

I send it to you for your interest in Allport, rather
than because of the importance I place on the communication.

I believe that Allport's vested interest in this Boston
Rumor Clinic and his own methods of combatting rumors makes him
somewhat less than partial and, further, that he did not have a 
proper understanding of the special purpose for which the rumor
report was written:- its interest to OWI in the study of this
problem.
I have not sent it to members of the Planning Committee
because I feel that much of his criticism is tangential.
