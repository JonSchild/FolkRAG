Greensnake-2

"I ain't got no chicken."

The boy said, "Poppa, tell him you'll be down there in
the morning with your game rooster, spurs on his feet five inches
long, comb--three."

Boy gets up, walks to the end of the gallery, turns
a somersault, turns to a game rooster, crowed three times.  Daddy
picked him up, carried him on down town. Whip out everything down
there.

The next week or two, there's gonna be a hoss race down 
there. This boy began to feel supperstitious, says, "Poppa, there's
gonna be a hoss race down there tomorrow."  He says,  "Hit's gonna
be a man down there , name of Greensnake, he's gonna want to buy
me."  Says, "I'm gonna turn into a black stallion, silver saddle on,
silver bridle on, brass studs."  Say, "If he wants to buy me and if
you sell me, take the halter off.  Poppa say, "Okay."

So by two o'clock the brass band commenced playing
and the boy gets out there and commenced running. He won everything
in the yard, and when this boy's daddy got ready to ride off, Greensnake walked up and say to him, say, "I want to buy that hoss."

He say, "I wouldn't take $50,000 dollars for him."

Greensnake say, "I'll give you $75,000."

He say, "Take him."

When Greensnake riding off, the old man hollered, "Aw, say,
I didn't sett that halter."

Greensnake say, "When I bought the hoss, I bought the
halter."

Told him, "Naw, naw, I wouldn't take $50,000 for that
