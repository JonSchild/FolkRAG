2. notes on some of the songs
which were sung at Mary
Gillies's the evening you were
there.
I hope you find the notes
interesting.
There was so much music, 
religion, romance and dancing
at Waulkings, to say 
nothing of the hard work
expended on the tweed from
the day the wool left the
sheep's back till the suit
arrived from the tailor ready
to be worn. Then a man (never
a woman at first) would pronounce
his blessing on the new suit - 
In these words, "May you enjoy
it and wear it (wear & tear) and
throw me your cast offs.
Yours sincerely R. MacLeod
