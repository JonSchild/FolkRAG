Nuclear Neurosis Blues
Words: BOBBY EVANS
Traditional Yodel Tune

Now the [*E*] Pres-ident he [*B7*] came up-on the [*E*] scene, - Chief res-ident of [*B7*] Washington D. [*E*] C. -
Now he [*A*] knew those Chinese Communists were mean, - So he [*E*] figured a big [*B7*] hero he would [*E*] be; - 
He sent [*B7*] soldiers by the score off to fight the Vi-et [*E*] war, Now he's filled the fu- ture [*B7*] with uncertain- [*E*] ty.- 
[*CHO:*] I got the [*E*] Nu- clear Neu- [*B7*] ro- sis [*E*] Blues -
Cause the pol-i-cy he [*B7*] chose is bound to [*E*] lose. - 

2. Now we know that L.B.J. is quite a guy
And there's nothin' in the world he wouldn't
try
But sometimes I get so scared I have to cry
'Cause I'm wonderin' if sparks are gonna
fly
War-bombs made a wasteland vast
Out of Hiroshima's blast
Hey, I'm twenty-one and that's too young to
die. (Chorus)

3. So I'm standin' here a shiverin' in my
shoes
While I listen to the Huntley-Brinkley
news
Huntley tells me of the many men we lose
Brinkley tells me that the Viet Cong
refuse
To negotiate a peace
Or let their fire cease
So I pour myself a dozen shots of
booze. (Chorus)

4. Now I'm layin' here upon my feather bed/And I'm singin' cause I'm stoned out of my head
Like a loaded Legionaire that's full of dread/'Bout the loathesome leadership by whom he's led
So I drunkenly rejoice / I ain't got no other choice
L.B.J. has planned my future far ahead. (Chorus)

Statistics on Bombing
To the Editor:
The statement by Secretary
McNamara that we are bombing
the two Vietnams at a
higher rate than we applied in
the entire European and African
theatres in World War II can
only stagger even the most
sanguine cold warrior. One
would imagine the Johnson Administration
would not tout such 
a grotesque statistic, for this
mighty weight of explosives is
raining down on a few thousand
underarmed and uneducated
peasants rather than a continent
full of mighty S.S. and
panzer divisions.
What Mr. McNamara's crude
boast proves, of course, is that
we have stumbled into the colonial
wars rather late in the
game. The combination of bold
organization and plenty of fastfiring
light weapons and mortars
is proving far more potent
than the confused and fanatical
gallantry of the Plains Indian,
the Zulu or the Gurkha of a
hundred years ago.
Far from stabilizing the
world situation, President Johnson's
not-so-splendid little war
is teaching a compelling and
dazzling lesson to potential insurgents
everywhere: that modern 
light weapons plus the techniques
mastered in underground
Europe, in China, in Cuba and
now in Vietnam permit almost
anybody to "take on the
champ." Fortunately, Mr. McNamara
is not hindered by any
of that sloppy, American sentimentalism
for the underdog.
Exactly how many such underdogs
even a Great Society
can turn into rubble remains to
be seen.

BARBARIANS
The new barbarian hordes
Again are roaming over earth
They fly the giant birds of steel
Loaded with death.
They roam the oceans silently
Inside the metal fish
Of huge proportions
Ready to kill and maim.
They spit the fire as they fly
They burn the trees
And food and children
To teach the others
"Peaceful ways."
They build the towns of steel
Deep in the bowels of the earth
To hide from the destruction
They scatter in their fear.
-S. P. D.
