                he took me in his car. . . Even gave me a drink. . .
Natchez:  (Shaking his head in wonder and chuckling) Yeah, man,
              they'll do that, too. . .
              But, looky here, we were talkin' about them camps.
              Now I have worked on levee camps and road camps---
              you know, where we put the rocks down and grade 'em
              and fill up the holes and put down gravel, [makin]
              buildin' the good road.  But what I'm gettin' at is the 
              way we lived in those tents and the food we had
              to eat. . .
              You know, it was really just scrap food from what other
              people had refused, sich as [p] old bags of beans and
              stuff they cpuldn' sell. . .
The Kid:  (Beginning to howl with laughter over the old and painful
               joke that he recalls)
            An' they had a name for it in the camp I was in---
                        La-la-loo!
                        If you don' like it,
                        He do!
Natchez: (Smiling his big, warm smile). . .Yeah, yeah, that's
                right.  But you'll like it. . .
The Kid:  (interrupting) I mean, you might not like it when you
            first get there, but you'll like it before you leave. . .
Natchez:  And they have them big truck patches---gardens, you
             know--- and they just go out and pull up greens, you
             know, by the sackfull and take 'em down to some lake
             or creek. . .
The Kid:  Sort of shake 'em off and [p] throw in the pot. . .
Natchez:  . . One of them fifty-two gallon pots. .Cook all the 
stalk and the roots an'. . .
