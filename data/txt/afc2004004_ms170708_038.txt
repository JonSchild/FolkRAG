6.
From the sun rising till the sun goin' down,
We fight like enemies when we do meet;
From the sun rising till the sun goin' down
We spied but one sail from the fleet.

And three we burnt an' three we sank,
The other three they ran away,
An' one we brought to old England's shore,
To let them know we'd won the day.

So now thank God we have won the day,
We've caused the French all for to rue.
There is Captain Ramsgate an' all his crew;
Let's every one give a good huzzaw.

There y' are.
D. Kennedy: Very nice.
Kennedy: A wonderful story.
Cox: (laughs)
Kennedy: No wonder it was a good luck ship.
Cox: (laughs) Wonder how true yarns are. Aren't true, do you think?
Kennedy:
Cox: The Death o' Nelson, do you know The Death of Nelson? There
aren't many people know it today, not - oh well, o' course, they
have got it now.
That's and old song. That have been on that magazine.
Kennedy: Has it, The Death of Nelson?
Cox: Yeah. That song, they had it on there a time or two, some o'
'em. An' they keep mixin' the things up so much.
Kennedy: Yes, they don't have them in the old way, do they?
Cox: No, they don't. I mean if you tell 'em - if the song, same as
you learnt it, same as that, they'll go - they'll wring it about
sometimes. I don't like that.
D. Kennedy: Do you - will you sing your version of it?
