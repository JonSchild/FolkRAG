Fred Davis   Rumors
1) I heard that all high school boys
which are eighteen years of age, will
have to register April 2, for the United
States Army. They boys that are sixteen &
seventeen will have to take examination
for the Army.
2. Another rumor that is going around
is that high school boys & girls which are under
sixteen will be permited to work on
farms this begining summer.
3. There's been word of saying that clothes are
being ration, [and some of this are going]
and some of these girls are going to be really
disapointed, but I am sure they don't
mind if the boys don't.
