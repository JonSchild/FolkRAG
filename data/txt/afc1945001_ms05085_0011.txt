2. The Army is sending our soldiers to Australia, Ireland, Iceland and other parts when they are badly needed right here at home to protect our own coasts. When Dutch Harbor was attacked, there weren't half enough men and I'm surprised the situation was not a lot worse.  Of course, just how bad it really was, has not been released, and we wont know for a long time.  That's another thing.  They withold information so darn long, creating a lot of unrest and uneasiness among the people.  We should keep more of our equipment and men right here to guard and protect our own shores.
