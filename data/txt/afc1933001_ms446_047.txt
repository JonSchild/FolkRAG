And in sight of Canaan's stand,
I am drinking of the fountains,
Flowing through this goodly land.

Now my friends are waiting for me,
Who have crossed the chilling tide,
Now I see them as they beckon,
Calling from the other side.

Soon I shall cross the rolling Jordan,
Soon I'll enter Canaan's land,
Then I'll shout and sing forever
With that holy happy band.

THE TROUBLES OF MY HEART ARE
GREAT

The troubles of my heart are great,
I will disclose to you my estate,
My brethren and my sisters, dear,
Oh, look what distress is near.

A loving wife I did enjoy,
Our hearts and souls we did employ,
We both, when young, did seek the Lord,
And found Him near in one accord.

And we together did sing and pray,
And sweet devotion led the way,
Till God did send to call her home,
Away to the New Jerusalem.

With five dear children we were blessed,
She embraced them all and went to rest,
My dear children, never fear,
Your mother's love will be with you dear.

And now to preach I do repair,
Dear children, left without my care,
