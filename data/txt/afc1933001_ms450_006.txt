SIS JOE
Italics -
When steel gets tight with the sun shinin' right warm on it, the track 
buck and it looks just something like an old slavery time fence row, in and out.
Well, this day the sun was shinin', the track was buckin', and I was walkin' an'
talkin'. The passenger train's due now, and I got to git out down there and line
that track up straight. It's just like a knittin' needle before the passenger train
gets there. I holler and call six of my best men by name. Chances are I'll call
Hank Stevens, Sonny Watkin, Sam Justis, Jim Williams, to get their linin' bars and
go down there. I have to tell 'em where to get it.

Track Caller:
Italics -
Go get the third johnny-head and touch it North,
So the track runnin' East and West; 
Touch it North:

Singing Leader: 
All right now, boys,
Let me tell you 'bout Sis Joe this time.

Gang:
Sis Joe, on the M&O,
Track heavy, but she will go.

Take a mule, take a jack,
Take a linin' bar for to line this track.

On the mudline, on the sand,
On the mudline, get a man.

Jack the Rabbit, on the M&O,
Track heavy, but she will go.

Track Caller:
Italics-
Run on down yonder to the third johnny head and touch it easy,
Quick, make hast, I hear the train coming'.

Singing Leader:
All right now, boys,
Let me tell you what I had for breakfast now.

Gang:
Little rice, little bean,
No meat to be seen.

Hard work ain' easy,
Dry bread ain' greasy.

Oh, Joe, Joe Lily Butt,
Oh, Joe, caincha pick it up?

Track Caller:
Italics-
Now, wait a minute, you stop right there,
Now, put your guns on your shoulders, and
Come walkin' back.
They pass by me, they going' the other way, now back.
They get up there and touch the joint just a fraction,
Just a fraction,
Go on to the next one and touch it just a fraction,
To the next one now and just barely move it.
