They tried the men once more, but not in Jackson as before
And the verdict of their guiltiness was found
They gave them ninety-nine years and the men both wept with tears
As the honest jury laid their verdict down.  Chorus.

Their mothers weep today while they are far away
There is nothing that can weaken a mother's love
They will think of them each day and will think of them till death
And will hope to meet them in the courts above.  Chorus.

*Sung by Maynard Brittain
Big Creek, Kentucky
