Keep task confidential

Rumors will here be defined for purposes of study by the Bureau
of Intelligence. This does not represent a final analysis nor a formal
definition from the point of view of grammatical purism not current 
usage. It is not a final definition, but a working hypothesis designed
to guide future reporters and analysts in connection with continuing
rumor study.

(1) Rumor is material which is orally transmitted. Essentially, it

to person involved in a direct face-to-face relationship. We will
exclude radio commenting in this category, and also exclude material
written in private letters, until the letter is transmitted orally.

(2) Rumor is material which is transmitted with the implication that it is
essentially true. Though it may actually merely represent a person's
opinion, opinions are very often passed along as if they were true, with
people losing sight of the possibility of the original analysis being 
in error.

If a person says, "I believe such and such to be the case", other
people who understand that it is merely on person's belief may choose
to hold a different point of view. But if the belief is passed on in
dogmatic form without a clear indication that it is merely an interpretation,
then people are in possession of what is purported to be a
fact.

There is a tremendous difference between a person emphatically
announcing, "I believe this to be so" and someone saying, "This is the
case." The actual form which the rumor takes may be interrogative
as well as declaratory. Often the tone of a question gives its answer
or makes an answer unnecessary. On merely verbal grounds, we cannot
be sure whether "Do you really believe that your war bonds will be sold
