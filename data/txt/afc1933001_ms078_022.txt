January 22, 1941

Mr. Frank Dobie

Austin, Texas

Dear Dobie:

    I've been a sick man, almost from the first day I
landed in Washington and I'm just now feeling dreadful over
the situation as it relates to you. I'm due back of January
15 and I can't possibly get there before March 1, and then
may not be able to do another thing but go to a hospital.

    As you will see, this is not going to give me any time
to put on the financial campaign that you and I had planned.
You can either take this as my resignation as President of the
Texas Folk Lore Society or as my promise, if I stay alive, to
go ahead next year under your direction and that of your new
president and try to establish the Folk Lore Society on a sound
financial basis. I want to do this more than anything else, and
I believe that I can help.

    I cannot help but feel humiliated that I have failed you
in this way, but the situation is as I have outlined. I am
dreadfully sorry.

    Always sincerely, I am, your friend,
    John A. Lomax

Dear Mr. Lomax:
    As editor of Essay Annual-1941 I should very much like
your permission to include in the volume your Atlantic Portrait,
"Will Hogg, Texan," It is an unforgettable picture of an admira-
ble man, a picture I should like the readers of my anthology, who
are mostly college students, to read and reread. Will a reprint
fee of $15.00, payable upon publication in April, be satisfactory?

    The Essay Annual series, published by Scott, Foresman and
Company, was begun in 1933. For your information I am enclosing
a copy of the table of contents for last year's volume.

    Sincerely yours,
    Erich A. Walter
