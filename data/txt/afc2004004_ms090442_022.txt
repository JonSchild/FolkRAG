running, said, "What's the matter?  What's the matter?"  He said, “Momma,
these folks found me out at last.”

 Greensnake.
 Asa Wave.
Greensnake was one of the f stest lads in the world.  There, I knowed
that to be a fact.  A little boy come walking on the raod, wanted, you
know, hollering.  He didn't see nobody asking so he go to the man's
house and stepped down to the table to go to eat.  Greensnake's wife
hears him and asks him, "Son, what are you doing here?"  "Well, I'm
gonna eat."  She said, "My husband more than 500 miles away.  He'll
kill you if he catch you here."  So the lad said, "Hide me somewhere,
please."  She hid him in the closet.
By the time she hid him in the cl set this man hit the house.  Says,
"Old lady, where the boy that washere?"  "I got him in the closet."
"Bring him out and let me see him."  She brought him out and he looked
at him.  He liked him pretty well so he [said] set him down to the table
to start eating and after dinner he took him down to the new ground to
learn him hw to work.
The boy worked, I should say, about 6 or 7 months, and Greensnake
began to like this kid and some of his pranks -- what he could do.
The boy got smart and turned to something and went home.
Why, I believe out in Texas there was a man coming  long one day says,
"Sam, bring your chicken down to town.  Tomorrow we're gonna have a
chicken fight."  "I ain't got no chicken."  The boy said, "Poppa,
you be down in the morning. You're gain useless.  You gonna sleep five
acres long, quarter to three."  Walked on im again, cut some of them
down gain less, poured three times, pick d on up a door and sat down.
Piled everything down there.
The next week or two there's gonna be a hog race down there.  This boy
