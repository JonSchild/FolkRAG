REPORT ON RUMORS

Anti-English
1.  The only reason that Rommel has been forced to retreat is that his supplies 
have been cut due to sinking of supply ships in the Mediterranean.  
As soon as he builds up his supplies, he will go after the 
English again, perhaps with success.  (Mining engineer, wide contacts 
with mine owners, comfortable income.  Phoenix, 8-11-42.)
2.  One reason for English reverses in North Africa has been their 
lack of attention to careful servicing of mechanical equipment.  The 
 Germans have been more efficient in repairing and serving equipment.  
(Small businessman, moderate income, supposedly heard this comment 
from a military observer.  Phoenix, 8-12-42.)
3.  England won't use any more of her troops in the war than she has 
to.  She knows the Germans can't get to the British Isles and is saving 
her men.  She won't open up a second front alone.  (Tourist and health-
seeker, about 50 years of age, unemployed but not looking for work.  
Phoenix, 8-12-42.)
