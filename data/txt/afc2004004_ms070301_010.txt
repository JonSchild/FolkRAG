- country is gone lonesome & bewildered - 

In the land of redirecting
And landgrabbing so vile
A proud, heartless landlord
Lived here a great while
when the League it was started
And the landgrabbing cry
To the cold north of Ireland
He had for to fly
- earned on post of manorhouse -
- it fell down

21| Plague of 1846 - you could hear 
your voice a mile thru the mist
- I have rarely
- Woman smells Dublin - puts her
apron over her nose "For the love of
God, get me away out of this place."
- May the devil ride with them to 
hell.
