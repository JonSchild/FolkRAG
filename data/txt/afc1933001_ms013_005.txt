The King Ranch, now run by
the grandsons of the man who
started it, contains two or three
million acres, the largest
ranch, I believe, left in the United
States. All the real workers are
Spanish or Mexicans, some
of whom belong to families
who have lived constantly in
[the] one place for a time longer than the age of the
ranch. This group of people, therefore,
constitute a sort of eddy
among the shifting peoples of
the Southwest. Their songs, some
traditional, others erected locally,
are of very great interest.
