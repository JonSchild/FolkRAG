Dear Mr. Lomax:
At a meeting last night the committee expressed
a desire to have you present to our Kalamazoo
audience your lecture "Documentary Recording" which
you mentioned in your letter of May 27.
Could you arrange to be here on the evening of
any Tuesday in January or February?  We are wondering,
too, about the traveling expense. As you will see
from the prices mentioned on the enclosed folder,
we do not attempt to make money. Can you estimate 
rather closely what the total fee would be?
What advertising material do you furnish?
What equipment should we secure?
Yours very truly,
Harvey J. Bouck
Harvey J. Bouck, Chairman
