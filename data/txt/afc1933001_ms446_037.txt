18

A witness to the people,
In this all should agree.
When King Messiah sought him,
Baptized for to be,
He was baptized in the Jordan,
The scriptures read to me.

The heavenly record given,
The voice and the dove,
Revealed Him to Israel
With token from above.
John still baptized disciples,
Christ made and baptized more,
The baptized were increasing,
The scriptures made it sure.

And this was their religion,
From this they took their rise,
And often John and Jesus
This ordinance did prize.
To Calvin or to Luther,
To Wesley or the Pope,
Or some of their reformers,
All others now look up.

Their sprinkle all the infants,
And sport with Christ and John,
They say they love the Savior,
Yet hate what he has done.
Through every age as a slogan,
From John down till now,
The Baptist find a people
Who do as they avow.

Then come and be a Baptist,
And follow Christ the Lord,
And show you love the Savior,
By walking in His word.
