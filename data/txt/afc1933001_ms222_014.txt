AUSTIN
You are under no obligation 
to explain anything
to me.  For myself I can 
say, whatever my shortcomings,
my blindness, my stupidity,
I have at least tried to be
frank in setting out what
I think.  Perhaps it is not
especially desirable a virtue
to hate a liar and a hypocrite, 
but in my case it 
is a fact - as I think you
know.  First of all the human
beings who are my children
have had the first right to know
what I think.  Lovingly, Father
