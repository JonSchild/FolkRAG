Mr. Archibald MacLeish
Director, Office of Parts an A Figures 
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

                        I have your letter of January 29 on 
the Rumor Clinic project. I also received a similar 
communication from Colonel Donovan. We look forward 
to a fruitful collaboration in this matter.

                        One point that we not covered by the 
joint memorandum prepared by Messrs DuBois, Potter 
and Williams concerned the releasing of materials to 
the Rumor Clinics in the colleges. In this connection, 
I am in agreement with Mr. DuBois suggestion that all 
informational material sent to the Clinics be released 
by the Office of Facts and Figures. Of course this 
would not include purely routine organizational directives 
and suggestions.

                                                 Cordially yours,
                                         (Sgd.) J. W. STUDEBAKER
                                                   Commissioner
