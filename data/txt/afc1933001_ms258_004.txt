IV DISCIPLINARY RECORD  (Given only in case of men not in good standing)






======================================================================
The unit of credit is the "full course." an average of nine hours each week  (normally three hours of class-room work and sex hours of preparation) for thirty-sic weeks is the approved minimum amount of work for the ordinary student in a single full course.
   Sixteen full courses, of which at least two-thirds must be of C grade or higher, in addition to the prescribed English Composition, are required for the Bachelors degree but beginning with the class of 1933, for those candidates who spent not less than four years in residents and who are in fields of concentration requiring General Examinations, the course requirements have been reduced to 16 courses, with grades of C or higher in 11 and a half, if English A-1 is prescribed or 15 courses, with grades of C or higher in 11, if English A-1 is not prescribed. From four to six full courses (or their equivalent in half courses) constitute a full year's work, except for those seniors who are allowed to work at a lower course rate because of tutorial work in preparation for the General Examinations.

The standing of every student in each of his courses is expressed, on the completion of the course, by one of five grades, designated respectively by letters A,B, C, D, and E; A and B  are honor grades; C is passing; D passing but unsatisfactory; E failure. "Abs." indicates failure to obtain credit for the course, owing to absence from final examination.
