[My education was limited.  I attended high school at Holly Springs 
but didn't finish.  I was teaching school at Bobo and planned to use the money 
I made to go back to school when I got the job at the bank.  I read a good 
deal; I'd always read anything I could get my hands on.  The white people in 
this town have supported the Negroes they liked.  Charlie Banks stood high in 
this town.  He operated a store in the building where the bank was.  It was 
in 1895 or 1896 that he had a little trouble with a white man in his store 
and shot and killed him.  He didn't belong here but was from outside.  A 
gang came in here to do something to him but old Mrs. Clark came and took 
him home with her and nothing happened that night and he came on back and 
carried on business as usual.  Charlie got that federal building up there.  
They had been trying to get a building for a long time and couldn't and Charlie 
came here and told them he'd get it for them for $500.00  They gave him 
$300.00 and he got on train and went to Washington and in two months it was 
announced that a new federal building was to be built in Clarksdale.]

I can't remember when I first became interested in music.  My father 
was an old time singer.  When I was a boy he had a choir and trained them to 
sing by notes.  He had learned back in slavery.  His old master had taubht 
him shape notes.

The first instrument I played was a cornet.  I just picked it up and 
learned it myself.  Then I learned the clarinet.  When Handy came here I was 
playing the clarinet.  [I just got me an instructor and taught myself.]  They had 
a white band here and a man had bought him a clarinet but he couldn't learn 
to play it.  He's living now -- Mr. Landry.  He sold it to me for $15.00.  
I sent to Philadelphia and bought myself an instructor for 75 cents.  Music is
