54 B2 Drum rhythm and dance: Yen
Valou. 
Loi to whom song is /especially addressed:
Papa Damballa.

The two flags are shaken out during this song in honor of all
the loi. It was sung by Madame Degras, the most important
mombo present, and meanwhile the hounsi drapeaux (the servitors
of the flags) were saluted by La Place with his rusty old dress
sabre. Several of the women were dancing. (The transcription
of this song is quite imperfect, sing the habitants at Pont 
Beudet know different versions of the same chant and Madame
Degras for reasons of policy is not available to me for the
time being.)
