LITTLE BIRD, GO THROUGH MY WINDOW 

Little bird, little bird, go through my window, 
Little bird, little bird, go through my window, 
Little bird, little bird, go through my window, 
And buy molasses candy. 

Cho: 
Go through my window, my sugar lump(2)
And buy molasses candy. 

Blue bird, blue bird, go through my window,
Blue bird, blue bird, go through my window,
Blue bird, blue bird, go through my window,
And buy molasses candy. 

Cho: 
Go through my window, my little bird, (2)
And buy molasses candy.
