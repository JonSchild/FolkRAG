TO: William H. Webber
FROM: Don M. Lochner, Florida

In accordance with your telegram effort is being made to check the
Eleanor Club matter, with results thus far being confined only to
Pensacola.
In Jacksonville a city detective is giving individual attention to
the matter and has not encountered anything of that nature prior to
my conversation with him this morning.
However, since the first rumor was from Pensacola, I have telephoned
Sheriff May of Escambia County who states that he has had reports of
an Eleanor Club in his territory, but he regards it as more of a movement
than an organization. So far as he knows there are no officers
and no formal meetings, neither does he have any idea as to its objectives;
but he is of the opinion that anything of that nature may
have resulted from several visits by Mrs. Roosevelt in Pensacola,
during which she spoke at the negro school, and that some effort may
have been made by the colored people to do something to testify their
appreciation for the work she has done and is doing in an effort to
better their conditions.
Sheriff May states that if any formal organization exists it is not
of a nature which has caused any concern by the sheriff and his deputies,
and he seemed very much unconcerned over the whole matter.
Additional report upon the result of the Jacksonville investigation
will be made as quickly as available, and an effort made to check
other parts of Florida in a manner appropriate to the nature of this
inquiry.
