And then they caught me way out by myself.  I had a shotgun
that stayed at home.  And they took that shotgun, 5 of them,
and broke it, hit it over the r[a]ilroad, broke it all to\
p[i]eces, and they kicked me till I was so sore I couldn't
walk for a week, like to kick me to death, like to kick
me all apart, broke that gun all to pieces,. . . . . . . .and they
sure did dirty stuff. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . .

(Outsid[e]). . .  Put this wall here and around here.  I keep
busy trying to do stuff.  My wife trie3s to get me
not to garden, but I garden every year.  I raise pota[t]oes
and everything, its be[e]n a bad year, it's been so dry.
My garden is 150 foot down and 80 foot across it.   Raise
a lot of stuff.
AL:  Feed your family through the winter.
Nimrod:  Lord, yeah.  Canned stuff will do all throught the
winter, then you raise another crop.  Course I buy a lot
of stuff, I mean we have our green beans, we have out beets,
we have out radish, we h[a]ve our tomatoes, tomatoe juice. . . .
I help her put it up.
AL:  Does he work in the kitchen with you and help you get
it up?
Mrs. W:  Yeah, he helps can.
N[i]mrod:  I took a big quart of beans in that tub there, I
know [h]ow to fix them to keep them from breaking, and I
cook 'em till they get done, th[e]n bring 'em in to her.
