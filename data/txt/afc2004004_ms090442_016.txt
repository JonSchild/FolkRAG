The boy seed that Greensnake was gonna catch him. He run on out the 
back and turned into a hummingbird and got in the air. Greensnake 
turned into a bald-eagle and run him all over the world. The boy 
seed that this guy was gonna catch him. See a good-looking girl 
sitting on the tree, you know, waiting on the company. He flew down 
there and turned into a ring and got on er finger. Greensnake flew 
down there, cut down, and turned i t o a man with plenty clothes acoutring 
that girl to get the ring off her finger, see. All his talk 
was, "baby, give me that ring." Just about the time he almost 'suaded 
her to give him that ring, he jumped off there, got around and turned 
into a box of muffins there to eat. He opened his mouth and busted.

This woman lived awayout in the woods. - - All by herslef. And she never 
did 'low noman there. How come nobody did never see nobody go there. 
So everybody that went around says, "Don't nobody go around and see 
Annie?" Says, "No, I never did hear nobody goin over and seen her." 
Says, "I wonder who goin with her." "I don't know. It ain't nobody 
there at all. I'm goin over there tonight, and I'm goin git on her." 
Bailey Lefthand left about three o'clock, you know. Lefthand wasa 
cow buyer, so he w nt and bought up a lot of cows to go by this woman's 
house.
He says, " Now, lady, could I stay here all night tonight?" She says, 
"Mister, I don't 'low no man to stay here." Says, "Well, I ain't no 
man. I'm a woman-hater." "Woman-hater?" Says, "Yeah." Said, "All 
right. If you is one, you can stay here all night."
So when he got on and went into the house, she says, "Well, I ain't 
got but one bed." He says, "Well, I'm a woman-hater." It's hot, in 
the summertime, so him and her went in the bed, you know. Ru[?]  wi[?]
