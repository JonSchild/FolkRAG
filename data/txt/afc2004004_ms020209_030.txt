RECORD REVIEWS
The Anthology of American Folk Music Vol. 2 Social
Music   Folkways FA 2952
The recordings in volume two of Harry Smith's
1952 anthology can be divided roughly into two
groups--dance music and sacred music. The first
half of this volume is more or less dance music,
mainly fiddle tunes. Beginning with "Uncle Bunt"
Stephens 1926 recording of "Sail Away Ladies"
(beautiful, archaic, solo fiddle) several varied
fiddle styles are heard. These range from the typical 
southern mountain style of Jilson Setters to
the fine Louisianna cajun music of Blind Uncle
Gaspard. The highlight of this section is easily
the "Brilliancy Medley" played by the great Eck
Robertson. He is one at the greatest fiddlers on
records. Many parts of his selection sound as
though two fiddles are being used instead of one.
There is also a group of dance tunes played on
guitar, a jug band selection, and several cajun
dance tunes. Each of the selections in this
section is enjoyable and valuable in its own way.
The religious selections also cover a multitude 
of styles from the "lining hymns" of Rev. J .M.
Gates to the country music sound of the Carter
Family's "Little Moses". The sacred hard (shape
note) style is heard in several selections (for a
mine of information on sacred harp singing see
George P. Jackson's White Spirituals in the Southern 
Uplands). There is a great deal of excitement
generated by many of the cuts i.e. "Judgement" and
Blind Willie Johnson's "John the Revalator" (one of
finest recordings in the set). This is another of
in that group of recordings that deserve to be play-
again and again as does the whole anthology.

Leadbelly: The Library of Congress Recordings
Elektra Records EKL 301/2
This is a very difficult set to review. It
is massive, exciting, and historically important.
It presents some of the finest Leadbelly material
ever released yet it is rough listening tor even
the most ardent Leadbelly tan. The recordings were
made by John and Alan Lomax for the Library of
Congress between 1933-1942. In those days the
Archive of Folk Music was getting substantial money 
from the government and expanding its collection
rapidly. The early recording equipment was not
technically great but vast ammounts of music was
recorded and thus preserved. However, the old
discs have been sitting down in the basement of the
of the Library of Congress for many years. Sitting
and rotting away. The old recording discs were
never meant for long term preservation, they should
all have been transferred to tapes long ago--but
the money was stopped, and America's musical tradition 
decays into oblivion. Our country can afford 
billions of dollars for "defense" and space 
exploration but a vital part of America's history
is allowed to perish for lack of funds. As each
year passes the material becomes less and less
listenable as these recordings will attest.
The recordings presented in this set are
difficult to listen to because at the poor surface
quality ( cracks, chips, a high degree of surface
noise, etc.), however, they are vital listening
for anyone interested in Leadbelly and his effect
on American music. For all their lousey sound
quality they are the best recordings of him I've
ever heard. Lawrence Cohn's notes and transcriptions 
are good, but I wish he would have given the
exact date for each recording ( after all they were
recorded over a nine year period). The selections
cover the wide range of songs that Leadbelly performed
--dance tunes, topical songs, ballads, blues,
and religious music. The famous songs are here--
"Mr. Tom Hughes' Town", "De Kalb Blues", "Becky
Dean", "Bourgeois Town","Ella Speed" and many others.
There is also some good interview material. Most of
the well-known songs are performed better here than
on other recordings. This is a set of records guaranteed
to intrigue and anger any true lover of
American folk music.

Happy Traum, Finger Picking Styles For Guitar
Oak Publications, 64 pp. $2.95
Happy Traum has transcribed guitar solos by
acknowledged masters of finger picking. This is
a boon to those who have spent long hours in
front of their record players trying to figure
out just exactly what John Hurt, Â·or Sam McGhee,
for instance, are doing. Also included in the
book are Elizabeth Cotton, Doc Watson, Dave Van
Ronk, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Joseph Spence.
Happy gives the number of the album on which the
song may be heard in each case.
Cisco Houston, 900 Miles Oak 96 pp. $1.95
This is a beautiful collection of songs by
the late folksinger who was a partner of Woody
Guthrie. Many fine songs and a discogrophy.
