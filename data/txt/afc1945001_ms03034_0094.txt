Dr. Eugene Katz                              2.                                   Oct. 8, 1942

(4)   Several sentences and paragraphs in the Report are taken verbatim 
from Knapp's various communications. Also the tri-partite classification 
is his. For this reason I am surprised that the acknowledgment of sources 
makes no mention whatever of his contributions.

(5)   Why should a mild and harmless communication of this sort be 
Confidential? Should not all the help possible be given to the many 
people working in this field? I see nothing in your report that could 
harm public interest. In fact there is little in it that is not common 
knowledge already.

(6)   My concrete suggestions would be:

a)   that no further fact-finding studies be made without including 
evidence of the effectiveness of various means of rumor control.

b)   that OWI make itself acquainted with the experience and methods 
of local and decentralized organizations

c)   that help be given these organizations, but that cumbersome 
"coordination" and "supervision" be avoided. Isn't it true that 
 certain of these organizations are ahead of Washington in many 
respects?

d)   that small subsidies be arranged to aid local organizations 
that are at work, provided they maintain a sufficiently high standard 
of operation.

                                                                      Sincerely yours,

                                                                    Gordon W. Allport

                                                                        Gordon W. Allport
