"When you see how bureaucratic, wasteful and inefficient our
Government is, you wonder if democracy is the right form of Government after 
all" - heard many times August 2 and 5, Chicago.

"Government is afraid of the farmers" - "Farmers are best cared for
group in America" - "Farmers are a bunch of ignorant, selfish ingrates" - 
"Too many farmers are beating the draft by hiding behind a cornstalk" - all
heard many times in Edgar County, Illinois, August 2 and 5.

"There are over 1,000 soldiers sick right now with Yellow Jaundice.
Some of them have been sick since February and over 100 of the boys have
died with it.  And all just because the War Department didn't check and make
sure about the serum!  Why inoculate them at all?" - heard at Eitel's
Sandwich Shop in the Field Building in Chicago, August 6.
