The Maid Saved from the Gallows
(Mama, Did You Bring Me Any Silver?)

Lead Belly learned this child ballad from Margaret,
a girl with whom he grew up [with] in the country near Moorningsport. 
Her version, as she now remembers it, is presented below. The
reader will notice that the usual conclusion where the victim is rescued by the sweetheart
disappeared.

"Mama, did you bring me any silver?
Mama, did you bring me any gold?
What did you bring me, dear mother,
To keep me from the gallow's pole?"

"Son, I didn't bring you any silver,
Son, I didn't bring you any gold,
I just come here to see you
Hang on the gallow's pole."

But for Lead Belly the ballad has lost all of its original significance,
and the process of ballad-decay has gone a step further.
Since Mary had forgotten the
sweetheart who comes to the "po' boy's" rescue, Lead
Belly, the folk-artist and convict, could noway allow him to
hang with the hard words of an unforgiving mother ringing in
his ears. Maybe Lead Belly simply forgotten what Mary sang, but we
believe that the instinct of a real balladist
wrought the change in the
mother's heart. Here is Lead Belly's contribution
to an ancient ballad tradition.

"Mother, did you bring me any silvo?
Mother, did you bring me any gold?
