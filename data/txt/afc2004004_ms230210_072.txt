(All through this part three or

hands at the drums without
losing the beat
or having any noticable effect
Debotte-a dance where as many 
couples may dance, changing 
partners, each may vie for 
versatility. The debotte is 
similar to that of Dominica,
Martinique & Guadeloupe.
Variation is piquante, limited
to less couples, usually no
more than three.        as
Debotte loosely referred to belaire
or bele, known throughout islands
including Grenada, Trinidad-Tobago
