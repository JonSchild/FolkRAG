Two soldiers one time, they was working on the field, you know, and. . . .
LOMAX  Start that again.
:  While, while they was working on the field, you know, those two
soldiers, they found a dead animal, you know.  And one of them said that's a dead
mule, he said.  The other one said no, he says that's a donkey, he says.  So while
they was arguing a lieutenant came by.  They said lieutenant, what is this,
that dead animal there?  He looked at that dead animal awhile.  He says, well,
he says, according to the bible he said I'd say an ass.  He said I want you to bury
it.  Well they started digging a hole to bury the old thing, you know.  And
a WAC past by and she said hey, soldiers, what are you doing, digging a foxhole?
One of them turned around, no, he said, not according to the bible.  He says. . . .
[LAUGHS]. . .oh, let's see, it was a, what did. . .yeah.
     A man [UNCLEAR] springs, he was going to, across, the river, you know, on
some business, you know.  So when he got to the chapel, river bridge, there was
a man taking his clothes off, you know, on the bridge.  He said hey, fellow, he
says what are you intending to do anyway?  He say I want to drown myself, he says.
Drown yourself?  What's the matter?  He says you nuts?  He says you don't have
no reason to commit suicide.  No reason to commit suicide?  He says the [UNCLEAR]
aren't worth living for anymore.  So the guy who was telling me that said,
well he said, I just left him to discuss the matter and I went on my business.
He says when I pass back, he says to go back to town, he says I pass on the bridge.
[?], [be. He said you know something? He said] that individual, he says, he must
[the cop was still [UNCLEAR] on the bridge even]
have had a convincing speech, convincing speech, because he says, the cop was taking
his clothes off, too, he says.  [LAUGHS]
:  You know last week I was going 80 miles and hour, me and my girlfriend.
She's driving.  And we pass on, a young nigger about 15 years old, pass
[UNCLEAR] that nigger and not a scratch.  How'd that happen?  The nigger 15 years
old, he's not, not too big.  80 miles an hour.  How'd that happen?  Not a scratch.
Now he was fishing crawfish on, on the bridge.  So we pass on the bridge,
pass [UNCLEAR], pass over a nigger.
[DIRECTIONS]
:  No, I didn't, he was fishing crawfish.
[DIRECTIONS]
:  We're trying to keep them clean, I'll be honest with you.  [CROSSTALKING]
LOMAX  [INAUDIBLE] . . .French speakers, Cajun speakers, right?  But now
you, you can be proud of that.  But once upon a time people made it hard on you
when you spoke your own language, didn't they?
:  We were laughed at, ridiculed, and punished, [whipped].
LOMAX  Tell us about that, please.  The more. . .
:  One of the reasons I left Mamu in 1932, I was about 13 years old,
but like he said, working in the cotton patch was not exactly my cup of tea.
So I asked my father if I could go to this particular bording school for brothers,
Christian Brothers.  Ihad a friend who was already there.  Anyway, I went to
this school, 7th grade.  And mostly I think it was to get away from this, what we
just discussed.  At that, that year they had declared an open war on all French
speaking people, I would say.  Not only kids at school, the parents at home were
scolded by the superintendants and the principals and told to learn English
and make their kids speak French at home.
     Do you remember that?
     They  wanted the parents to speak it, too.  And they wanted the kids to teach
it to the parents.  In other words, it was completely outlawed.  And when I
left in '32 that was about the climax.  And I went on to World War II on the, after
World War II when you came back from overseas, especially in France, North
Africa, we saw the variety of our second language.  And the amazing part is that
the French could understand us.  Then we started fighting the public schools.
But to give an idea, and I, I guess they meant well.  We never did hold it against
the, these people, and the English people for that matter.  But if we were caught
speaking just one word of French for that matter on the school ground, anywhere
on the school property, we were reprimanded, generally whipped, paddled, given
lines to write, I must not speak French at school at first I think it was.  
Then after that [UNCLEAR].  I was proud for one thing I [UNCLEAR] whipped when I
was in the fourth grade, I was proud, let me tell you.  You know why I was proud
when I was in the fourth grade?  I was the only one who could vote in the whole
class.  I was 21.  I, I. . . .[LAUGHS]  I as soon [INAUDIBLE] to bed and a bottle,
a pint of [Muscatel].  [UNCLEAR]  among our friend, you know, they said [divide
