I could sit right here and think a thousand miles away,
Sit right here and think a thousand miles away,
Have the blues, I cannot remember the [name] day.

Tell me babe, what's on your mind,
Tell me, baby, what's on your dog-gone mind,
Tell me baby, what's on your dog-gone mind.

I never believed in having no one woman at a time,
Never believed in having one woman at a time,
I always had six, seven, eight and nine.

I said, babe, oh baby, babe,
Oh, babe, oh, baby,
You 'bout to set your papa crazy.

I got a sweet woman, she lives right back of the jail,
I got a sweet woman, lives right back of the jail,
She's got a sign on the window[:] Good cabbage For Sale.

That gal's got a horse her pal's got a diamond ring,
That gal's got a horse her pal's got a diamond ring,
Her sister's got a baby from shaking that thing.

Oh, I've got the low down blues, got them low down blues,
Oh, low down blues, yes, low down blues.
I've got the low down blues, too dog-gone [?mean to cry]

Do you see that spider crawling up that wall,
Do you see that spider crawling up that wall,
She's going up there to get her ashes hauled.

Yes, got the low down blues, got them low down blues,
Got them low down blues, oh, low down, low down blues,
Got them low down blues, too doggone mean to cry.
