An officer at the Elks Club in Mandan on August 4 said that a friend of his had just returned from Detroit where he had been working in some war industry plant and that the general opinion in that area was that if you want to slack down, now is the time, because after elections Congress is going to get good and tough and crack down and put a ceiling on wages, draft men from 18 to 21, married me and other men that have been deferred for one reason or another, and in general get very tough on the public.
