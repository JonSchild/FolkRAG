Dear Miss Kennedy:

Our folk song and dance collections show no 
volumes for the [Tahitianer?] the Fijians. The 
following two volumes may be of some use to 
you:

Sechs Samoanische volkslieder fur klavier 
von Georg Capellen. Published by Breitkopf 
& Hartel, Leipsig, 1905. These publishers 
have always maintained a large stock in 
this country and a music dealer in your 
locality may be able to obtain it for you 
if your State library does not have it. Or you 
can obtain it from the Library of Congress through your local librarian.

Melodies Tahitian,  by Homer Tourjee, published 
by John P. Broder, San Francisco, 
1905.

Very truly yours,

Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge
