John Lomax in naturam personan," Cason pointed at me.

The gentle rocking motion of the cowboy ceased. He flung away
 the blade of grass, fixed me with his eye for a moment. Then he rose 
abruptly and went into the house. Almost instantly he came back and 
thrust a book into y hands, the yellow-backed first edition of Cowboy
 Songs.

"Did you do that?" he demanded.

"He's guilty," Cason interrupted. (Maybe Cason was hoping that he
 would get off after I was shot.)

But---

"Fellers, my humblest apologies. Your servant now and forever. 
Come in and partake of my homely fare." He bowed low and swept the
 ground with his hat. Then twinkling humorously, he chanted the western 
chuck call, similar in meter to Browning's.

"The hillside's dew-pearled, 
God's in his Heaven, 
All's right with the world."

The cowboy's chant was less poetic but momentarily fuller of meaning:

"The coffee's on the fire, 
The bacon's in the pan, 
The beans are in the pot, 
Come and git 'em 
While they're hot."

And did we?

The sun was low when we, watered and fed and rested and entertained,
 plodded on our upward weary way, leaving that cheerful philosopher standing 
in the one doorway that used to face Bright Angel Trail. I had 
said finally:

While other good people are lying in bed, 
The devil keeps a-workin' in a Texian's head. 
"Texas is Texas any way you fix it; 
Whiskey is whiskey any way you mix it."

"You're damned tootin'," retorted the cowboy.
