grutty stuff.
Rev. D:  (triumphant and still laughing)  You remember the last time I
an you had a talk together?  I tole you:  There is some things right on
the bank.  An on that bank was rotten.  An if you mess around on the bank,
you understand, where it was caved-in ground, you're subject to go under.
You understand?  Well.  Anytime your life is involved in anything you better
not mess wid it -- that part of the ground.  Because -- I want to live as
long as I possibly kin.  Isn't that right?  None of us want to die yit
I don't care how much you pray, I don't care how much you do nothin
you want to stay here as long as God will let you stay here.  An so when
God call you you can talk to God like Hezzikiah an Moses talk wid him.
God had to let you stay heah an little while longer, if he heard you like
he heard them.I ain't jokin.  Now thass one thing bout it.  You ever drew
your breath a little bit? (suspires heavily)  You hear that?
(He does it again) (lazy sensual enjoyment)  That feels so gooooood.
When I git so I can't do that, you understand, the jig is up.  You understand?
When I git so I can't do that, the jig is up.
Eliz:  Well I don't want you to tell me anything -- well, I really wish
that you would tell me everything.  I have to admit that.  You know it.
Rev. D:  You dyin to git it.  I know that.  I don't have to think it.  I 
know it.
Eliz:  I want everything but I'm not going to get it.  However --
Rev. D:  You ain't goin hear it.  You ain't goin hear everything.  It ain't
goin be like that.  Want me to tell you the reason why it ain't?  It is a 
known fact that Lizybeth has got to take care of Lizybeth.  Ain't she?
Thass right.  I want the truth.  You ain't gon let nobody git too close to
you.  Is you?  All right.  Why should I let a person git close
to me?  Come on. Come on!
Eliz:  That's true.  I know there are certain things everyone keeps to themselves.
What I want now though--
