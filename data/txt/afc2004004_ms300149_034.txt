Dear Friend,
The enclosed check in the amount of
$15.00 is your payment for singing
in the chorus with Bessie Smith on
seven songs which will be included
on records as part of a new series.
The series is being put out by
Prestige, Inc. sometime before
Christmas. A record will be sent
to the group leaders so that you
will be able to hear yourself sing-
ing with the others.
My best regards to you and all my 
friends on St. Simons. 
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
