Dear Father:

Would you please sen me a copy of the sentence that
the Arizona judge addressed to his Mexican prisoner about to
be hung. Nick and I would like to use it on the C.B.S. sustaining
series which begins next Monday, 10:3â€“ 10:45, E.S.T.
and will continue three nights a week, Mon. Wed. Fri., indefinitely
thereafter. C.B.S. did not sell the program commer[c]ially
and ha[v]e decided to sponsor it themselves. I will use a
good deal of material from your books and I think if you're
still willing to make the deal about my debt, I'd consider it
very seriously. I'n not going to make enough money this year
to pay you back and I'd like tomget it, of course, in a way
that is familiar to[n]you. Please include the rights of Cowboy
Songs at least on programs with which I have something to do
myself. I hope your trip is going extremely well. Give my
love to Deannie and Bess.

Much love,

Alan
