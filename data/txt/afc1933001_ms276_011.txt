We are glad to report that the Local is in healthy
condition, with a loyal and steadily increasing membership
and enjoys a position of respect and influence
which will enable it to play a useful part in the important
developments impending under the new Librarian.
We are reaping the reward of these three years of uphill
work.  With your support and your active cooperation,
Local 28 will be a power for good in improving
conditions for the entire LC staff.
