2)  THere lives an old woman in Highbury,
And out of her arse there rose a tree.

3)  And none of the neighbors will eat of the fruit,
Because it comes from so dirty a root.

4)  I married a woman, I eat of the fruit,
All neighbours around us, they called me a brute. . .

The polite version was like this. . .
1)  I shipped on a Yank and she was a hard ship,
There was plenty to do, and nothing to eat.

2)  One day we were working around on the poop,
Our chief mate was helping us round with his boot.

Lomax: You said that the tempo of the shanties depended on the
size of the crew and the size of the sails. . . .
Ras: Well, it had to do, because we were mostly short-handed, and
the men, hauling for instance, on the topsail halliards - an
upper topsail after it was reffed, - well, it was a very heavy
job and it had to be done very slowly. The shanteyman sings the
first part, and then the men, in those cases in hauling time,
when all had to pull together like blazes - was very much
accentuated. . . .
1)  O Shenandoah, I have to leave thee,
And AWAY o rolling river,
O Shenandoah, I have to leave thee
AWAY I'm goin' to roam, 'Cross the wide Missouri.

2)  O Shenandoah, I love your daughter, etc. .

Here's one of the fast shanties. - Hand over hand. . .
1)  I never saw the like since I was born
When a big buck nigger with his sea-boots on
Says Johnny come down to Hilo, poor old man.
O waker her! O shake her!
O wake that gal with the blue dress on
When Johnny comes down to Hilo, poor old man.

2)  I'm in love with a girl across the sea.
She's a dusky beauty and she does love me.

3)  She waits for me, she waits for you,
Her ways are free and her dress is blue.
