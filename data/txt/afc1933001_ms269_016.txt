PROJECTS:

1. A complete index, both textual and melodic of
American Folk Songs to be carried out by the Music
Unit of W.P.A. in the Library of Congress with its
present staff and under the supervision of Dr. Charles
Seeger.  This index already is in process, and is to be
completed in rough within a year and will [be able to]
furnish suitable tunes and songs models for any cultural
project with the Defense Program.  This will include service
to commercial radio and commercial movies.

2.  A subject regional index of American Folk Tales, Anecdotes,
Customs, Local Heroes and Backgrounds and etc., -
highly selective in character to be initiated and carried
through by the Writers Unit of the Federal Writers Project,
with the Library of Congress under the direction of
Dr. B.A. Botkin. At this task, the staff of the W.P.A.
Catalogue Project, Federal Writers Unit and Historical
Records Unit can be combined and coordinated. This index
will furnish material to creative writers of every kind,
including ideas for radio transcriptions, documentary films,
propaganda phamplets and etc., for use in every section and
corner of the United States.

3.  The series of five or ten radio programs transcribed in
the field and put together in the sound laboratory of the
Library of Congress documenting a group of American communities
in all the cultural diversity and setting forth
their peculiar relationship to American Democracy and
their individual formulation of the American Democratic
ideal.

4.  To these ends, the Archive of American Folk Song[s] must
have additional staff and funds to carry forward, these
diverse projects.  A budget and breakdown is appended at
the end of this memo.
