Dear Mr. Lomax,

Unfortunately my personal knowledge of the jazz artistry 
of Jelly-Roll Morton is very limited indeed. I am acquainted 
only with a few of his old recordings, and knowledge of his 
life gathered thru articles in Down Beat and Metronome--
as I recall ( I haven't kept files) , there was a fairly thoro 
account of his career in Down Beat about November or December, 
in addition to the writeup of the recordings that he will make for you.

I do know that my particular standard of appreciation is 
rather circumscribed by the act that I am well ( too much ,
 many people say) immersed in the jazz environment of this 
particular decade. Jelly Roll Morton was one of the pioneers 
of jazz, doubtlessly, and historical interest demands close 
attention to his knowledge and memory of old styles. Thus 
he fits quite appropriately into your scheme. But there 
is one man today living whose name is on the pinnacle of 
all jazz--Louis Armstrong--and to my mind his art should 
by all means find a place in your project. For Armstrong 
is also a pioneer of jazz--He came before and inspired that
great white genius, Bix Beiderbecke, as you well know. 
His jazz has its roots deep in the folk-music of the southern 
negroes, and to catch him at his best, listen to his performances 
in Harlem, where he is playing for his own race in a language 
they understand. If it is piano music exclusively you are 
interested in, I suggest the veteran Meade "Lux" Lewis who 
plays in the old Boogie-Woogie style; Count Basie, who leads 
his band in Harlem; Duke Ellington and Teddy Wilson, the solo 
flights of whom represent to my thinking the best piano 
improvisation of modern jazz.

I am sorry to say that I find no other articles on Morton 
in my bibliography ( Which, incidentally, I am sending to 
Dr. Spivacke tomorrow) . For additional information, however, 
on him or other jazzmen, I suggest a letter to Charles Edward 
Smith, in care of the Hot Record Society, 303 Fifth Ave, N.Y.  City.

If I have been of the least service I am happy. Devotees 
of the rather esoteric calling of jazz ( and not Tin-Pan Alley) 
are few and far between, and I am always very glad to receive 
a letter from one. If I can be of any service to you in any 
way, don't hesitate to write. After Aug. 20, I will be in 
Durham, N.C. (Duke Lib.) where I am assistant to the reference 
librarian. Perhaps I will stop off at the L.C.

Sincerely,

Melvin C. Oathout
