Dear Alan:

I am planning to be at Sandy Spring, Maryland, over the Thanksgiving
weekend.  Will you let me know whether or not you will be at the
Library on Friday or Saturday of this week so that I may get in
touch with you?

I wish to talk to you about square dances and also to find out
something about your broadcasts.  If you have a booklet outlining
your air programs, I would appreciate a copy.

As you probably know, the contract with your father is now in force,
and we are awaiting word from him or from you as to just which
records he wishes to have in order to make the selections.

I am turning over to our Order Department the long list of additional
records you requested, and they will ship to you for your
Archives a copy of all that are still available.

With best wishes.

Sincerely yours,
R. P. Wetherald
