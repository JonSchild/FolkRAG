SOME OUT-OF-STATE COMMENTS

PROFESSOR G. L. KITTREDGE, Harvard University:
"Few lectures delivered at our University have been so successful. The students, as
you must have seen, were delighted, and the members of the Faculty who were present
were equally interested."

PROFESSOR WILLIAM LYON PHELPS, Yale University:
"Every moment of the hour was interesting; he succeeds to a high degree in combining
definite instruction with continuous entertainment."

DEAN L. B. R. BRIGGS, Harvard University:
"Every member of the modern language conference that I have met has expressed
real pleasure in hearing your paper the other night. The more colleges that get a
chance at your lectures the better."

CARL SANDBURG:
"I think no one delivers the cowboy songs with the reality, the truth to life, that
is heard in the Lomax renditions. He gets their stride and stridency, and their rough
tang."

PROFESSOR L. E. BASSETT, Stanford University, California:
"Our audience was delighted with the vivid glimpses of the life of the cowboy and
the striking description and rendition of cowboy songs."

PROFESSOR ARTHUR C. L. BROWN, Northwestern University, Evanstan, Ill."
"John A. Lomax's reading and lecture entitled Negro Spirituals was highly successful
and entertaining. The students would go to hear him again if they had the chance,
I am sure."

PROFESSOR HERBERT E. GREEN, Johns Hopkins University:
"At the University and at church today I have heard favorable comments on the
lecture from people of various ages, tastes, and callings."

PROFESSOR REED SMITH, University of South Carolina:
" 'Best thing I ever heard in that old chapel,' is a comment several students have
made to me."

PROFESSOR LEWIS F. MOTT, College of the City of New York:
"The students showed the most intense interest from beginning to end, and many
spoke to me afterwards of the pleasure and profit they had derived from this presentation
of a phase of American life."

PROFESSOR FREDERICK TUPPER, JR., University of Vermont:
"Professor Lomax's genial address upon 'Cowboy Songs' made such a delightful
impression upon us all that, for the past month, refrains and choruses of the ranches
have been humming in our heads, and certain phrases of the plains bid fair to become
proverbial among us."

J. C. SEEGARS, Dean of Temple University, Philadelphia:
"Both faculty members and students have expressed enthusiastic appreciation to me
and we feel that your visit was a distinct contribution. We hope to have you again
next year."

PROFESSOR FRANK C. BROWN, Trinity College, North Carolina:
"All who heard you here-Faculty, students and friends alike-were greatly pleased
with your lectures."

PROFESSOR J. W. TUPPER, Lafayette College:
"We get a picture complete of the Cowboy life and all its emotions. Even the free,
easy, open-hearted style of the songs pictures just such a life on the broad plains of the
great Southwest:
"If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom to get one sweet sup."

PROFESSOR S. M. TUCKER, Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn:
"Perhaps the pleasantest evening of our college year was Professor Lomax's lecture
on 'Cowboy Songs and Ballads.' I have never seen a more interested audience."

PRESIDENT R. E. BLACKWELL, Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, Va.:
"The students are still talking about the questions that your lectures raised, and your
visit has done good in turning the interest to the subject of our ballads."

PRESIDENT CHARLES C. THACH, Alabama Polytechnic Institute:
"It was in every way a delightful event, keenly enjoyed every minute by the large
audience. It seemed like a genuine echo from the Western prairie."

PRESIDENT A. H. UPHAM, Miami UNiversity, Ohio:
"It has been my privilege thrice to present him to student audiences, who have
received him most enthusiastically and clamored for his return."

PROFESSOR M. ELLOWRRD SMITH, Oregon State College:
"Your songs furnish lecture material in a class by itself. Quite beyond the mere
humor of many of them, it is their fundamental human nature which takes the
audiences."

PROFESSOR EDWIN F. SHEWMAKE, Davidson College, N. C.:
"Students, professors and townspeople were captivated by the way in which you
revealed the romantic charm, the pathos and the humor of cowboy life as reflected in
the songs."

DEAN J. O. CREAGER, University of Arizona.
"To say that his Harvard and Yale sponsorship was fully justified would be to speak
tamely. Our students and faculty pronounced him the best of the season, and we had
an extensive and varied program of lecturers and entertainers."

GEORGE M. MILLER, Professor of English, University of Idaho:
"Of all men who have been students of the great ballad authorities, I believe that
you have done more than any other to increase the general interest in folk song."

JOHN W. BARTON, Vice-President, Ward-Belmont School, Nashville, Tenn.:
"I am writing this to tell you just how thoroughly our girls enjoyed your recent
visit here, and what a rare treat they received from your lecture on the cowboy and
his songs. You are keeping alive in a very fine way one of the real American traditions."
