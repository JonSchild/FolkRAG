[*getting a husband*]

murder ['em] ya.  Then what'll ya do?  Ya can never tell.  An' so I 
say there's plenty a  folks in this worl' that look like would 
make somebody a good husban'.  But I don't feel like it bein' me.  
No,                          .   I see 'em an' see 'em an' don't 
see em.
TL:         Well, how did you come to like your husbands?  What did 
happen?   How did they make you like them?"
BJ:         Well, jus' come to like 'em.   [Jus'] I guess' that musta been 
my husban'.   Jus' come to love 'em.  But [the treatments , ??] I got good treatments.   Like 
[I swear I got very] I was tellin' ya the other day, good treatment.   And the right kind  of treat-
ment.   [That what's] That's what makes me like anybody.  Tha's all.
But in mistreatment ________anyhow.   Ha, ha, ha.   But it
mus' be. . .I dunno. . .It mus' be like they say the Dago tol' the
[jury] Jews, "I jus' lika you as long as you lika me; you don' lika me, 
I don' lika you!"  I reckon tha's the way  it is, I [ddoo] don' know why.
. . .Jus' [?Never]that I ain't never, never. . .don' make no difference.  
[me.]   If I can get one I'm all right; if I don't get one I'm all 
right.   An' I don' worry about it; don't think about it.   I don't 
allow it no mind; don' give it no mind.   Sometime at home when it 
be rainin', bad weather, an' [I be at the winda] I'd wake up, said, Now I need 
a husban'; I don' wantin' to have this squeaky wood.   Somebody 
would be out workin'.   I'd know I'd have someone [?????] help bring in bread.  But 
I'd get up [on that] in there, get right out the bed, get round and and put my clothes on.  Sure!  
[By the time] I get ready to hit the ground!  Time I get all right, feet 
get to feelin' all right, says, I don't need no husban'.  Ha, ha, ha.  
I don't need no husban'.  I can go on alone.  Hum.

[*MAMA'S  HUSBANDS*]
             But when I got one, I appreciate it [( ] to the eyes - ['till 
 he dies)] -- if he was a good one.   Yes, suh.  But my mother, she 
has herself a husban' an' she ain' gonna be without one for long.
TL:         What?
BJ:          She never be without a husband.   Not long.
TL:          Is that right?
BJ:          Um-hum.
TL:          She doesn't like that, huh?   She doesn't like to be 
without one?
BJ:          No, never.  I                     she don' go huntin'.  
They jus' hunts her,[to give] they gets her.  She was born for that 
purpose, I mean. . .(Jus' a good husban' ?)  (Jus' a good whore?)
