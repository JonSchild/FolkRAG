When I was livin down in the South end of the 
county I had a wife name Molly, see. So I came home one day and 
Molly out there, runnin round and round in the yard tryin 
to catch a chicken. I said, "Molly, what you doin tryin to 
catch that chicken?" 
She say, " I want him for the preacher."
I say, "--- the preacher!"
She say, "I did, but he still want chicken."
