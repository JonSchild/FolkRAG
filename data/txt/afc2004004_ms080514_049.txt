Cos, ah, Sam was an entertainer, and ah, some
of those plantation stag parties, like ah
might have been given by the father figure in
ah, in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof;  might have been
pretty raunchy affairs.  And here's a song that
would have suited them.

[*04 . 15 . 21 . 08*]     A   Ah, Sam Chapman's performance really
exemplifies another - one of the roots of
the blues, which was in the lyric song
tradition of the Scots-Irish and of ah, of
the folk south.  Ah, lyric flourished there
and the, the blues was a black adaptation of
that, and Samg - and Sam sings them, ah, the
way they were partly conceived of, as ah 
3 or 4 line strokes, repeating themselves,
same tune every verse with little variations,
and his - the, the ah background was a strum,
ah, ah, of the guitar, rather than the
complex picking out of the melody that you've 
seen with ah Jack Owens.
