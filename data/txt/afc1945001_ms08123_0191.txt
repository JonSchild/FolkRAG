A Letter My Friend Wrote Me,

Well, Henry here I am again. Feeling find, wish 
you were here. Boy! I am in trouble. Do you want to hear
it? It happened a week ago while the boys and I were
playing a game of cards. I was a little deep in debt and 
didn't have any money to pay off. The boys knew it, and 
they said the only way that I could repay was to say 
no to all the question asked to me by the sergeant
tomorrow. The next day all was going swell, until the 
sergeant got to me. He was a mean sergeant, badest in 
the whole world, it seemed to me, and I was the next to 
be called on. He asked me, would I like to be a sergeant 
like him? I told him no. He just laughed it off playing 
as if he didn't care, but I could see he was boiling inside 
and my knees began to tremble. He asked me did I 
think the General a swell guy, and knew how to handle 
a army? I said no again. Just as I said it the General 
himself walked up, and now I am in the guard 
house, and don't know when I am going to get 
out.
