Ah, Mrs. Davis did he ever speak about his music, did he ever talk to you about having any training himself you know like he really started me off you know along with many other people, did he ever tell you about who was the man, who ever really put him on to the keyboard.
MRS. DAVIS:
I think he learned some of it in a school in a blind school he was going to. He didn't really stay in the school too long because he didn't like the food and.
LARRY:
He didn't like the food.
MRS. DAVIS:
He didn't like the food and he left but he learned some his music he learned some of it there a lot of it he picked up himself, he told me, a lot of his music he picked up. Sounds would come to him and he would try it out, he learned to be one of the greatest.
LARRY:
Yes he did. At the time he was coming along that type of thing was possible it was easy to meet people doing it, You could pick up a cord here a cord there and eventually you have a whole thing. But I haven't heard anybody really come across the way he did, I mean he got all of it, I mean he hit a note you felt that not you knew it was done.
