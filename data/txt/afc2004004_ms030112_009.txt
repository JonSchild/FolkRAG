GD:     So this here is what you talk to yourself about. 
And partly where you used to run out, where you 
run from it when you started talking. Because 
you do not want to get hurt. You understand?

[*3*]
LJ:       I tell you speaking of Travellin, How was your travelin days 
when you first started?

GD:      In my travelin days, it was travelin days and in 
them travelin days it was travelin days again. You 
understand.

LJ:       Ah hmmmm.

GD:      You don't have no (pasture) to run on [over] 
yonder, you're going to a little home. Okay, You 
turn around and you turn over in it you understand? Sometime 
[I laugh] (?) I play my 
guitar and I run off the streets from the police.

LJ:       You know those small towns.

GD:      Some big towns too. But I'm lucky enough not to be 
run off too much. He can round the edge of town, 
where I can get hold of something. Kept on till [where] I 
got where I is now. Ya know, whenever you say there 
ain't nothin for you to do, there is something for 
you to do. You just ain't got to it, thats all. 

LJ:       Hmmmmmm.
