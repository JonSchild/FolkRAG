12 - B  Female   Negro 

It seems that farmers are feeding their cows 
vanishing cream these days.  Have you noticed 
how the cream on the milk has vanished? 

Roses are red 
The public is blue 
Sugar is scarce 
And can goods too.  

Do you know why Hitler changes his socks twice 
a day?  Because he smells defeat.  

A lady went to a butcher shop and bought 
60 lbs of meat.  She then asked the grocer 
to deliver it.  The grocer replied.  "I can't."  
"Why?" said the lady.  "I see you have a wagon 
outside."  Yes," replied the grocer, "but you 
have just bought the horse."  

Everyone seems to have gone all out for 
Shakespeare nowadays.  Even the butcher.  His 
cry is "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a 
horse!"
