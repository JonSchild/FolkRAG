From Margery C. Quigley Montclair NJ.
Heard in Hampden Mass Aug 14 1942
Subject:  Class Distinctions and Hatreds

"People in Massachusetts feel that
Wilhelmina ought to act like other people
when she is in America. There is an editorial in The
Springfield newspapers almost every night about the special priviledges
she receives or takes. If she is going to stay
here among us she ought not to sweep through
our roads at 70 miles an hour when the rest
of us must keep down to 40; and she has a huge
entourage and guard using up gasoline and tax
money"

"It all began when families weren't allowed
to see their boys go off to camp because it
would disturb her in her private car on a switch at Pittsfield

"She is one of the richest women in the world
but recently her secretary ordered tea from
a little tea shop out near here for "the royal party"
of 20 or 30 and a supplementary tea for all
the police guards and then they never showed
up nor sent any word and the tea shop keeper
was left holding the bag."
