9-1695        MEMORANDUM   

Library of Congress
Recevied Sep 25 1934 MRL
Secretary's Office

Music

To The 
Librarian of Congress

From The Division of Music
September 24, 1934

Referring to Request of
Mr. John A. Lomax
University Station
Austin, Texas

With this I am submitting for your approval the text of a letter which Mr. Lomax is asking us to print and mail under government frank to the superintendents and wardens of each of the 350-odd institutions listed in the directory sent herewith.

In sending me this text Mr. Lomax writes, in part:
"I think it would be effective if either you or Mr. Putnam were to add a postscript to my letter, expressing your opinion of the project and asking for cooperation".

Such a postscript might also emphasize that the material collected will come eventually to the Library and form part of the permanent records of the Folk-Song Archive.

Chief, Division of Music

Oliver Strunk

Approved Librarian
