Eugene Katz, Special Services Division
Rumor Project

Orientation
Because of its direct relationship to information
policy and because of the interest expressed by the Director
in this approach to the problem, the rumor project for
September 1st is considered as an attempt to learn the relationship
between amount of news and amount of rumors.

There are obviously many other important aspects 
of the rumor problem - for example, (a) varying susceptibility 
to rumors of different social-economic, educational,
age,
occupation and geographical groups and (b) varying effectiveness 
of different types of rumors - but these and others
which have been proposed appear to be subordinate concerns in 
this particular study.  Some material on these subordinate 
topics will appear if the study is executed as proposed in
the following outline, but it is submitted that they should 
not be the primary concerns of the project. 

Outline
To get at the rumors themselves in order to determine
what, if any, relationship exists between the presence 
or absence of news and the prevalence of rumors, the following
procedures are proposed:-

(a) Reporting of overheard rumors by OGR field staff
members from thirty-one areas
(b) Reporting of overheard rumors by listening posts
in Boston, Chicago, Wichita, Cleveland
(c) Special study b Surveys Division among various
income and occupational groups in a specific 
area (Baltimore or Philadelphia or some other 
war industry city)
(d) Reporting of rumors overheard by correspondence panels.
(e) Reporting of rumors overheard by Polls and Surveys
field staff as encountered by them in the course
of their regular travel.
