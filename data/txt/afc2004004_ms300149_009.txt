Dear Paul:
Last year my attention was brought to a group of LP's to be produced
by Alan Lomax for Atlantic Records, and I was asked if Alan Lomax
was under contract to our company for his songs.
I answered that Lomax was under contract, and that we have the rights
to all lyrics or music composed by him under the provisions of paragraph
3 of his contract of January 9, 1959.
Atlantic informed me that it intended to publish the songs Lomax recorded
including those composed by Lomax.  I advised that if this were true, and
in conflict with our contract, we would seek full remedy under law.
Subsequently, I've been informed by Atlantic Records that Lomax did not write
these songs.  Under the circumstances, we would have no claim.
For your guidance, at no time have we served anyone with legal papers,
letters or made any claims.  As a matter of fact, as the facts are now
stated, we do not make any claim.
All good wishes,
Cordially,
HOWARD S. RICHMOND
