Dear Mr. Broome:

I should like to report for the project that
we finally decided on Blairsville, Georgia. We 
left the day after we saw you and stayed there for
nearly two weeks recording a great deal of material,
including the accounts of disaffected tenants who
were being moved off their land. 

I think we shall be able to make about three
programs out of it with good material and plenty of
material for each one. I shall let you know how
they come out. Perhaps sometime you will be in
Washington and can come in and listen to some of the
records we made and I think you would be greatly
pleased. 

In the meantime, let me express the appreciation
of myself and all the members of our party for your
cordial reception of us in Knoxville, and for the 
fine party you gave for us.

Cordially yours, 

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the 
Archive of American Folksong
