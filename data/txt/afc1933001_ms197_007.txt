[*Alan's letter attached*]
June 5, 1950
Dear Alan:
We will recommend approval of the 
interesting project which Jean Ritchie is undertaking 
in collaboration with you in Kentucky.
In all probability, it may go through but may not 
be approved until the first week in July since we 
have used up our funds for this fiscal year.  Will
you give us an address to which we can ship the tape 
and can you tell us the type of machine you are 
using so we can send you either single or double 
track reels.

As for the restriction, the Library feels 
that material collected in part a Government expense 
should not be restricted beyond a reasonable time,
say one year.  I doubt that anybody would be asking 
for the material unless we broadcast the fact that 
we have it and we will not do that.

With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
