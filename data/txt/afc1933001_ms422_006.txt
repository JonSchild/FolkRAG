Farmers Union Creed 
GLADYS TALBOTT EDWARDS 

Because I know that as an individual, I am nothing, but 
banded with my brother farmers, I am power, I pledge the work 
of my hands, the fruit of my soil and the loyalty of my heart to 
the Farmers Union. 

I will keep my eyes on the goal and let no petty annoyances 
make me forget it. 

I will attend my local meetings and let no personal animosities 
keep me from mingling with my neighbors for our common 
good. 

I will support our business institutions with my entire production, 
and our leadership with my utmost confidence. 

And I will always remember that, greater than any man in 
it - worthy of any sacrifice - deserving of all faithfulness, is the 
Union itself, built for me and by me - my own organization.
