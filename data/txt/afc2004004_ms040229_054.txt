p. 108 Ee - hoo the Milking - nice 
chorus piece for the milking 
scene
p 116 MacGregor of Roro - lament for 
departed hens - soon melody 
for parody
p. 164 - Our Auld Wife - mouth 
[m]ie making fun of [narty?]
old woman. Very good lively 
air and text. 
p. 184 Air Fal-Al-O - sailor's 
ballad of departure - nice
air and words. But rest of 
text awful. 

The Killian Collection
No. 5. A nice [?] melody for 
girl who's true love has 
left her.
No 12 A fine shieling song
but awful text
