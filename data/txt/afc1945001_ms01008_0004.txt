That was all the navy high command knew at the time it made the announcement.  A few hours later it was learned that the two damaged cruisers had sunk; but there was good reason to believe that the enemy did not know how much harm he had done us in the dark.  For if he had known, his ships would have gone right on to attack the transports then debarking our marines on Guadalcanal. 

It has lately been complained that our navy represented that action as a vic-tory, when it was in fact a defeat.  Well, a later navy communique said only that as a result of the action the enemy was forced to retreat.  Perhaps he was not forced to retreat; but the important fact is that he did retreat, and thereby missed the transports which the cruisers that were sunk had been protecting.  Either he was forced to retreat, or else he did not know how much damage he had done us; and since he did not know, it only made sense to withhold, for the time, the news that our forces operating in the Solomons had suffered such heavy losses.  That news, I believe, was held up longer than was necessary; but the initial delay was justified. (Incidentally the enemy claimed that he had sunk not four but fourteen of our cruisers in that battle.)

Something like a duplicate of that action took place off Cape Esperance on the night of October11th-12th; but that time the situation was reversed, and we won a clear cut victory.  In a few minutes fighting, two American cruisers sank three Japanese cruisers and four destroyers.  But that time we did not know, for some days, how much damage we had done the enemy; the first reports, and our first communiques, announced the sinking of only one enemy cruiser, not three.  More good news came along later; but the public never seems to have realized that there, we did to the enemy precisely what he had done to us at Savo Island two months before. 

It is still more doubful if the enemy knows how much loss he has inflicted on us in battles fought by air, with the surface ships out of sight of one another.  This was the case in the operations in which we lost, at various times, four air-craft carriers--first the Lexington, then the Yorktown, and the Wasp, and the another whose name is still withheld for a valid, and gratifying, reason of military security which was not present earlier.  Each of these ships sank some hours after the action in which it had been damaged; each sank at a considerable distance from the scene of the action, at ta time when no enemy warships or planes were in sight; and in every case there was a strong probability that the enemy, though he knew the vessel had been badly damaged, did not know that it had been lost.  It may be said that Tokyo broadcasts claimed these sinkings.  Well, Tokyo broadcasts claim everything and admit almost nothing.  In the operations in which we lost the Wasp, Tokyo claimed to have sunk three of our carriers; in the battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, when we lost the last one, they claimed four.  A compilation of Tokyo broadcasts shows that all told, the Japanese have announced the sinking of nineteen American aircraft carriers, when we have only seven to begin with.  Nineteen is the claim; four is the fact.

Actually, for all their assertions, they never claimed the Wasp by name till we had admitted that she was lost; so there is strong reason to believer that they were never sure they had got her till we told them.  That consideration applies equally to the last carrier, sunk on October 26th.  We reported that carrier on October 28th as damaged, which was all we knew then; and announced her loss on October 31st, as soon as we were sure of it.  Why did we tell the enemy something he did not know?  Because a situation had been created in which it seemed imperative to reassure the American people that their government was telling them the truth.
