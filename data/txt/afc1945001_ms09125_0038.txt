walking down a road one sunny
morning. At the gate of a farm house
lay a little white dog. the cruel 
officers shot & killed the dog. they
then went up to the farm house
and knocked on the door.  An
old Lady about "50" asked what did
they want.
     The German officers replied
Hiel! Hitler! the dog is dead.
the lady said "Good Lets Celebrate."
