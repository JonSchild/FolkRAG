Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery 
Ironwood, Mich. 
Dear Alan:
I am sending this to Ironwood, hoping that you have
been able to proceed there.  You have certainly received your
salary check by now and so should be out of debt.  I was very 
strongly under the impression that you understood the U. S. 
Government never wires salaries to anyone. 
You also have probably gained possession of your
advance money and realize that there is to be no more.  I can 
only repeat my previous warning - guard your expenditures
accordingly. 
We are sending 75 blank records to Ironwood today. 
They are addressed to you, general delivery, but they are coming 
via Railway Express, so don't forget to pick them up at the
express office, not the post office.  With these records is a 
single 1-inch blank sent to us by the Mirror Record of 58 East
25th Street, New York City.  This concern wants us to see what
kind of results we obtain from the disc, so please see how it 
turns out. 
Dr. Spivacke is back in the office today, feeling 
quite well again, but rushed to death with accumulated work.  I 
am writing you at his request.  He sends you his best regards. 
A big package of your records came in today which we
were very glad to get.  Keep it up! And my best regards, too
Sincerely, 
Edward N. Waters
