his informants to enable us to apply the following diagnostic formula:
R = I/N [I.A.] 
[*ego ??
(pretesting)*]
R= the amount of rumor
I being determined by such factors and ratings as:
1. prejudice rating
2. index of social participation
3. index of interest in war
4. ratings on allies
5. degrees of in-group identification
6. Ethnic characteristics
7. Class
8. Et cetera
[*latent attitudes 
importance
personality*]
[*desire to
get attention*]

N being determined by such factors as:
1, Newspaper and radio analysis in the community
2. Rating on level of information
3. Rating on confidence in news
4. Degree of satisfaction with news coverage
5. Et cetera  [*ability of him to explain tension[?] to himself*]
[*availability
subjective satisfyingness*]

We hope also to gain sufficient insights into the "secondary interviewees" 
to enable us to apply the same formula in a generalized or mass sense.

It is also proposed that a short questionnaire be constructed on the basis 
of whatever rumors are collected on the pre-test and that this questionnaire 
be administered to as many persons in the community as time will permit. 
The questionnaire might be in the form of a rumor game, "Have you heard 
this one?" The data thus gathered could be used to check the reliability 
of information given by the informant families as well as to supplement 
the overall qualitative picture.

Relationship Between this Study and Whatever 
National Picture May be Drawn from Data Collected 
by the Various Field Staffs

If rumors are to be collected during a week in August by the various 
field staffs on a national scale, the results of this study should be 
of considerable value in allowing a deeper interpretation of the total 
rumor situation. Obviously the extension of the results of this study 
must be made with great care, but it is believed that the psychological 
insights which are anticipated will more than justify such an attempt.
