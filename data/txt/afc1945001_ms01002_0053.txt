Dear Mr. Langer: 

This is to follow up my letter of February 28 regarding 
a suggested plan of setting up Propaganda Clinics to 
help prevent the spread of rumors. 

Part and parcel of the Propaganda Clinic program - it 
seems to me - should be the distribution of a simple 
pictorial manual. The nature and contents of such a 
manual are indicated by the quick rough which I have 
attached to this letter. 

The need for such a manual, small enough to fit a man's 
pocket and a woman's pocket boot, became apparent to me 
when I wrote to three appropriate federal departments 
and asked for some up to the minute information on the 
identification and analysis of propaganda. All I received 
from the federal departments was a general bibliography 
of long treatises on the subject - none of which would 
appeal to the average citizen and none of which could be 
put into a coat pocket. These books are all right - I 
know because I have read most of them, but they do 
not answer the need of the man in the street for an 
easy to read and easy to understand booklet on propaganda. 

The printing of these manuals in sufficient quantities 
would add up to some money - the question is whether or 
not it is as important to spend such a sum of money to 
help control a saboteur in our midst as it is to spend 
money - as we are - to stop bombers who may attack us 
from outside. 

Yours truly
