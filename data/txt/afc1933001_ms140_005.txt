Dr. Fredrick P. Keppel, President
Carnegie Corporation of New York

New York City

Dear Dr. Keppel:

Permit me to submit a memorandum outlining the needs of the
Archive of American Folk Song in the Library of Congress for equipment
and personnel. Funds for these expenditures are not available
in the budget of the Library and we, therefore, make application to
the Carnegie Corporation for a grant of thirty nine thousand two
hundred and fifty-five dollars ($39,255) to provide this equipment
and to assure its maintenance for three years. The use of this grant
is briefly discussed in the accompanying memorandum which can be enlarged
and supplemented at any point where further information is
desired.

Since this memorandum was prepared, we have been confronted with
the possibility of still further demands on the Archive for duplicating
services. The plan of the Interdepartmental Committee for Cultural 
Relations with Latin America, for example, includes the presentation 
of a set of the Archive's records of American folk songs to each of
the twenty-one Latin American Republics.

Finally, it might be noted that the equipment described in the
accompanying memorandum could provide a general phono-duplication
service, when this did not interfere with the work of the Archive and
the added income would provide for emergency expeditures.

We feel that the needs of the Archive are pressing as we trust
that you will see fit to give this application your immediate consideration.

Sincerely yours,
