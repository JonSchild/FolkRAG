ANNIE JOHNSON: Where is Barra? If you look at the map of Scotland,
you will notice that long chain of Islands known as
The Outer Hebrides, which forms a bastion protecting
the mainland of Scotland on the West from the fury
of the Atlantic gales. The southernmost tip of this
chain is the Barra group, consisting of several small
islands, of which the largest is Barra. These are the
most westerly inhabited islands of Great Britain.

Barra, once the stronghold of the Clan MacNeill is
but a small island, twelve miles in circumference, with
a population of about two thousand people, mostly
crofter-fishermen; whose love for the old way of
life and the old traditions has preserved for us a
rich heritage of folklore and folk music.

It is an island of sailors. The sea is in their
blood. It is their inheritance from the days of
Roderick the Turbulent, that bold Barra adventurer
who roamed the seas and harried the ships of good Queen
Bess as they returned laden with booty from the Spanish
Main. What cared he for an Atlantic gale? His galley
sheltered in the trough its mountainous surges. The
following song describes his boat putting to sea on
one of its reiving expeditions on a cold dark wet night.
It describes the ship - tall-masted with spreading sails
and floating banners. It praises the skill of the
helmsman/
