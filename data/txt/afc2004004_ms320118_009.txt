have been a millionaire, with his talents.   Most people
tell me, oh no, you can't be that man's son....cause I
would see that man.....that man there, I never seen that
man getting mad with outside people, he would raise hell with
us, me and my sister, and teach us some manners, but the
other people, he always would cooperate with the other people.
But he had his scene, no, I don't wanna make no scene.  I 
remember years back, Leo Swallow and all them people, I knew
all them people that was coming up at the right time, you
know, and they was coming to my daddy and playing music
together....
AL:   Can you play one of the tunes they used to play?
Canray:  (plays)   Leo played that with my daddy before he ever
recorded that....(he plays again)...They would call that, I 
believe, The Lousiana Blues, or something.  They didn't
know exactly, them people would go out and make their own 
music, and they would name it like, they would go at a different
territory, like let's say he would leave from Welsh and go to
Jennings, and they would play something and the people 
would like it, well, that's the Jennings two-step of the
Jennings waltz or something like that.   And then they had
a habit of taking a fast piece and making a waltz with it, or
taking a waltz and making a fast piece out of it.   Let me show. .
I'm gonna give you all a little demonstraition.   I'll just show
