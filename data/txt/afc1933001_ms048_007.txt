Mr. John Lomax,

Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir,
I am trying to get some information concerning
a song which I am told was well known
in Missouri about fifty years ago. The title
may have been "Thatcher Perkins was the
Builder of the 49", or that may have been 
just one line of the song. Since Thatcher Perkins 
was a well known locomotive builder, the name 
sounds reasonable enough, but I have not 
been able to find anyone on our B+O staff who
happens to know it.
I would appreciate very much any
information you might have. This is probably a
piece of sheet music. I have not found it in any
of the published collections of American Songs. 
Please address reply to 
Miss Olive W. Dennis
710 Walnut Ave
Baltimore, MD. 
Yours truly,
Olive W. Dennis,
Engineer of Service, B+ORR.
