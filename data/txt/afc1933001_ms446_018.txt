field by trained folk-lorists from informants whom the student, the poet, the
composer, would have never reached. A student of the migration of tunes and
tales and people will be able to come to the Library's collection and trace
through the Library's records the migration of the American people and hear
for himself the shift of taste and tongue from region to region and from decade
to decade.
     Even with its collection of over 10,000 songs from the South, the
Southwest, the Middle West, New England and the West Indies, the Archive of
American folk song has hardly begun to record the rich musical tradition of
America. With this in view the Carnegie Grant has provided for the purchase
of a completely equipped portable sound truck for field work. This sound
laboratory on wheels can visit the most isolated sections of America and,
under the supervision of Library folk-lorists, record the voices of Americans
discussing their problems, playing their instruments in their own way, singing 
and making their own songs. The resultant recordings will be acoustically
as good as commercial recordings of classical music and drama now available 
to the public. For the first time in history, the music and speech of the
people will be adequately recorded for preservation, general distribution and 
study.
     An additional group of six portable field recorders provided in the 
grant will be lent to qualified students of folk lore who wish to record and 
study the music of their own regions. The results of work undertaken by such
collectors will become part of the Library's Archive and will be duplicated and 
distributed. The grant sets up a revolving fund to launch the Archive in its
new career and the sale of records is expected to provide means to assure replenishment 
of this fund.
