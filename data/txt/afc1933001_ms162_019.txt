BEGGAR MINSTREL

OLD SID pauses in each town
to shuffle through a quaint hoedown;
His reedy song, in voice cracked thin,
Quavers through a snaggled grin,
While palsied hands and stumbling feet
Mark time to the rhythmed beat:

Ki-mo, ki, mo, do-mo, wo,
Mi-hhi, mi-ho,
Mi-humpti-diddle, rumpti-diddle,
Set back penny-winkle,
In come nip-cat, Johnny with the boot jack.
Sing song kitty, wont you ky-mi-o!

Music dance was mortal sin,
But parson found no evil in
Singing a play-party game;
Swing your partner without shame!
Belle in ruffled calico,
Looby-looin' with her beau!

Don't want a redbird,
Bluebird'll do,
Don't want a redbird,
Bluebird'll do,
Don't want a redbird,
I'll take you!
Skip to ma loo, my darling@!

Lou was like a pigeon bird
Or a sweet, unuttered word,
Mouth like brook-cooled apricot --
Strange it made his own mouth hot --
She had promised that come spring,
She would wear his wedding ring.

Up jumped Joe in the middle of the row,
Cornstalk fiddle
And a shoestring bow,
Sing song kitty, wont you ky-mi-o!
Sing song kitty, won't you ky-mi-o!

It was Jo he fought that morn
in the tassled, dewy corn;
