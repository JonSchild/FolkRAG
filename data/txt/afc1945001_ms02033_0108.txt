Peace (Continued)

4. The war will be over in six months now that we have
bombed Japan. 5-3
5. Stalin says that the war will be over by summer. 5-3
6. There will be a negotiated peace in six weeks.
Business men in the middle west are worrying about
surplus stocks on this account. 4-3
7. Lloyds of London and the stock exchange are betting
that peace will come inside the year. 4-3
8. Germany has offered Russia a separate peace. 4-4

Rationing

1. Canadians have unlimited supply of gas while we have
rationing. 3-4
2. There are three tankers in the Boston harbor loaded
with gasoline. They are to be dumped into the harbor
thus curtailing the gas supply so that rubber may be
saved. 5-4
3. Only second-hand rubber is being used for retreading
the tires of ordinary people. The good rubber is being
used for officials. 5-3
4. The rationing of sugar was undertaken in order to get a 
complete list of all those living in the United States
for the secret files of the F.B.I. 5-3 (F.B.I. knows nothing
about this)
5. At the present rate of consumption, the tire supply in
New England is enough to last 30 years. 5-3
6. Beet growers in California are being paid not to grow
sugar beets. 5-3
7. There is no rationing of any kind in the middlewest.
New England is being used for an experiment. 5-2
8. We have to go without gas while Canada gets all the
gas she wants over the pipeline from Portland to
Montreal. 5-1
9. All trucking will be stopped after June 15. 4-3
10. Hospitals can not obtain fuel oil without a priority
rating. 4-2
11. Sugar rationing really not necessary since alcohol can
easily be made out of wheat of which we have a surplus.
Sugar interests responsible. 4-2

Red Cross

1. The Red Cross is pouring negro blood down the sink and
actually using only white blood. (Story told among
Negroes.) 4-3
