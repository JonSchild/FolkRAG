Mr. Alan Lomax

Blairsville, Georgia

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have tried a number of times to reach you within
the past few days to tell you that it is impossible
to route your return so that you would be back in
Nashville on the 16th.  The schedule you will follow
will bring you into Nashville at 1:18 AM of the 17th.
I sincerely hope that this will not cause you any
great inconvenience.
 
Another thing, your trip will terminate at Richmond,
Virginia, rather than Roanoke, Virginia, as you requested.
I understand that there is no airport in
Richmond.  I am outlining the time schedule
on attached.

I trust you received the check for $110.00.

Sincerely yours,
[*Ingrid Johnson*]
Ingrid Johnson
Secretary to Mr. Fisher
