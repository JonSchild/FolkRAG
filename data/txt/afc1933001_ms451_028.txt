BATSON page two.

When Batson got in the jail-house
Locked up in the cell, (Safe, space?)
[*He*] Took a pencil right in his hand
He marked every day he laid.

Batson told [the]Mr. sheriff,
"Don't you know that's wrong?
You got me [because you]charged guilty unfriendly
And I know I ain't done the crime."

Refrain:
Cryin' oh mama,
[I ain't done no harm] I never harm no one

Batson, was beginning [begin to cry]
Tell you what did he do,     [*?*]
You could hear old Batson crying
Just like a baby child.

The day Batson cried, 
This is the words he said,
"You're trying me for murder,
And I know I never harmed no one."

Well the judge found him guilty,
The clerk he wrote him down,
The jurymen passed the sentence,
Poor Batson, he had to be hung, 
[*chorus I, Refrain I*]

Batson begin to wonder,
Batson/to moan, /begin
Batson told [the]his people
"You just have to leave your home."

"You may bring me coffee,
You may bring me tea,
You got to bring me everything I want
But ['*? 'cept*] that black jailhouse key."

Now you may dress in red,
You may dress in black,
You may dress any color you want,
But you'll never bring Batson back.

Batson's little girl begin to wonder,
Batson's little girl begin to cry,
Batson', little child begin to ask him,
"Daddy, what they going to do with you."
