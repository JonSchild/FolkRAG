Poughkeepsie, New York

Dear Mr. Nestler:

Thank you for your interesting letter.
I am sure the region you are working in is alive
with songs, I am astonished to hear that your
informants do not sing the songs, but recite them.
Haven't tunes stuck to any of them? Do you know
of the work of Herbert Halpert in your state?

I should like to invite you to deposit
a copy of your manuscript in the Archive where it
will be subject to suitable restriction but available
to students of folklore, and folksongs.

Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax
