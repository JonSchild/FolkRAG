Mr. Albert R. Beatty, Asst. Vice President
Association of American Railroads
Transportation Building
Washington 6, D.C.

Dear Mr. Beatty:
     Your recent letter concerning a trip planned by Mr. Alan
Lomax through the South to record old-time negro work songs.
     Reason for my delay in answering is that I have made an
effort to contact all of our division engineers who might have old
negroes still on their respective divisions who might remember
these old songs.
     I have accumulated some information that might be of
benefit to Mr. Lomax and if you will you can inform him that I will
be more than happy to assist him in any way possible if he plans to
pass through this area.
                                                         Sincerely yours,
                                                                (Signature) Ronald L. Coleman
                                                                       Editor
