THE STATLER HILTON NEW YORK 
COMPLETELY AIR CONDITIONED 

P.S. I am in New York, 
incidentally seeing Alan Lomax 
after a long time - no see- 
also seeing More Asch and 
a Brazilian folklorist- 
Juanita Elbein, whom I 
believe you have met. 

I am having a wonderful 
time and feel drawn back into 
the old current, I'm afraid I've 
been bayou-locked too long. 
My best to you and George; my
best wishes for your early healing
