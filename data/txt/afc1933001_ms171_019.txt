Dear Alan:

No, I have not lost interest in the project to have
a study of minority music in New York City made.  Have you
some more ideas as to how it might be set up? I should think
you might put it in project form if we are to get anywhere
with it.

How was the Mexican trip? We shall probably be 
down there during our vacation this summer and it will be good
to have your reaction BeFoRe TAKiNG OFF.

With kind regards and best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
