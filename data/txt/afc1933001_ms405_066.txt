Ten-Dollar Bill

Ten-dollar Bill's a bronc, pard, an' he's got a
heap o' sense;
That's him standing over yonder, peekin'
through the corral fence.
He's different from some horses, for he's shy
the yeller streak,
An' we're just like clost relations-sort o'
brothers, so to speak.
He's as foxy as they make 'em, an' plumb full
o' nerve an' grit-
Start that horse t' trailin' cattle, an' he don't
know when to quit!
Wonder how I come to name him? Well, it
didn't take much skill.
Yuh see, I bought that bronc, pard, for a lone
ten-dollar bill!


See them scars along his forelegs an' that
long one down his side?
Well, they marks the time that me an' him
near crossed the Great Divide.
We was down in Black Hawk Basin, hazin'
out a bunch o' beef,
When the derned ol' fools stampeded, an' to
make the story brief,
I got yanked clear out the saddle, an' the next
I knowed, Bill, he
Was a fightin' off them critters-kind o'
sprawled out over me.
Well, the rest is dim an' hazy, fer I'd surely
had a spill,
But I owes my life- Lord bless 'im!-to that
same Ten-dollar Bill!"


No, he ain't no ravin' beauty, but he's got a
heap o' sense-
More'n heaps o' these here humans, without
meanin' no offense.
He is gaunt an' lean an' wall-eyed-just a
runty, rusty scrub.
But I reckon' how you're seein' where he
ain't a common dub;
Heaps o' folks have tried the ride 'im-not a
soul has stayed but me;
An' whenever I come nigh him, he's jest
tickled fit to kill.
Lord, I wouldn't take a thousand cash fer
ol' Ten-dollar Bill!
