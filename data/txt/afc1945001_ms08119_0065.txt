Battaglia, A
                 2nd period                     [*A*]

b) Once upon a time there were three
Japanese zero planes. At the [xxxx] same time
there was an American pursuit plane.
As I said before, once upon a time

b) There was a Colonel in command of a
regimend and a sergeant came to him
in search of being released because his
wife was sick. The Colonel told him
that he had received a letter from his
wife saying she didn't need him. So the
sergeant walks to the door and he then
looked at the colonel and said, "There's
two big hairs in the regimend and I'm
one of them because I'm not married".
