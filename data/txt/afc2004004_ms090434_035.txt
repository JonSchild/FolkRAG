Writings of Mattie Dear
O, come let us sing unto the
Lord; let us make a joyful noise
to the Rock of our Salvation.
I was blessed with the priviledge 
last Sunday to go to Chapel
Hill M.B.C.  My business there
was to see was it true my cousin
Lula Herron was dead.  And
When I [ma]de known my business
the good church members told
me she sure was dead and it
hurt me to my heart.  I come near
screaming when they told me,
 "Yes, she is dead and buried." I
know that we are all born to die
but what hurt me so was that I
never got a chance to see her.
She was a cousin of Hun and
she sure did love Hun.
From there I went to the Centennial 
M.B. C., pastored by the
Rev. J. V. West.  Public collection 
raised was $48.15 and two ladies
sure sung sweet.  The Rev. West
text 24th chapter St. Luke 29th
verse.  I forgot his subject but he 
sure preached a soul reviving
sermon.  Now that being the last
sermon I heard this year and I
was satisfied for I seen so many
of my friends after service.
Then I went to Sister Jackson's
home for dinner and she gave
me BROWN-SKIN service.  I ate
until I want no more, them
Clarksdale Church People sure
[?] treat you nice and feed you
[?] I went to see
[?] Henry Hawkins
[?] 
[?]  while there and
[?]  to see Bro. and Sister
[?]; they were as fat as they
could be.
Now let me tell you all one

thing it sure is prayer time.
I received a card from Mrs. P.
W. Smith, she is in Phoenix, Arizona.
We are nearing up picking
now. You know who's glad?  It's
Mr. Billy Butler.
I can't understand the people;
some of them aint reguarding 
anything the Lord has sent his
storm through here once.  Please
don't forget it.  If the Lord say
so I will be at my own church
Sunday to hear the first sermon
there.  I hope I won't get disappointed 
like I was at Locust
Grove.  I sure do get  Joy out of
Good Service.
Mr. and Mrs. J.B. Snider sure
is nice to me since I started writing 
in their paper.  They sure 
have caused me to get a many
present from different people.
All you go to do is do the right
thing.  So pray for peace.
