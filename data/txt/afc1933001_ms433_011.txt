THESE THINGS SHALL BE

Words: J Addington Symonds
Music: Charles T. Griffes

These things shall be!
A loftier race
Than e'er the world hath known shall rise,
With Flame of freedom in their souls
And light of knowledge in their eyes.
Nation with nation, land with land,
Unarmed shall live as comrades free,
In ev'ry heart and brain shall throb
The pulse of one fraternity.

New arts shall bloom, of loftier mould,
And mightier music thrill the shkies;
And every life shall be a song,
When all the earth is paradise.
There shall be no more sin nor shame,
Tho' pain and passionmay not die,
For man shall be at one with God
In bonds of firm necessity.
