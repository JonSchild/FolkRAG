My dear John Avery:
I wrote you a letter last night from home and brought it 
along (I thought) to mail here. But I seem to have lost it.
So I am hastily writing you again.
Thanks for your tow recent letters and apologies for my
failure to respond to the first one. Fact is, I have been ill,
an illness that made it doubtful whether I might go to Denton or
a hospital for one of these internal operations perhaps.
It seems, however, to have been a minor illness. At any rate, I am
so treating it. Somebody said that fleas have smaller fleas to
bite 'em, and they have smaller still, and on ad infinitum. And
I am treating this disturbance in my stomach as a flea, for the
present.
I do not think Mrs. Smith will be able to attend with me.
We have 'things' and a 13-year-old girl in school, and it is hard
for her to get away. But, God willing, I shall be with you on May
1st and 2nd. She still says she can't go. But she may change her
mind when she thinks of Denton being a girl's town.
The subject of my address, as I wrote you once before,
will be "Feuds" or "Feudin'", as you may prefer. But if you like
another topic, name it. The address will be the same either way.
You may put me down for the shank of the second day, if you don't
mind. My thoughts sometimes are embelished by what has gone before,
for one thing. Then I will not have to hurry home, for another.
We had an old man run for city alderman in my town. He asked the
boys to vote for him as a special favor, because, if on the council,
he could get away lots of nights by telling his wife he was going to
a council meeting. When I thought about him a moment back I made that
explanation for wanting the shank of the second day.
I am writing Dobie. One of you suggested that I might have
the pleasure of riding to Denton with him. But that was before the
rubber shortage. The situation may be different. An old maid got an
invitation to a party, during prohibition. On the lower right hand
corner was a notation: "DDD". Much puzzled, she asked what it meant.
"Drink, dance and diddle," answered the interrogated party. "I can't
dance and won't drink," she answered; "but I'll get to the party if
I can." Same here. And I'll try to arrive with Dobie.
Your friend,
RRS
R.R. SMITH

Dobie is bringing Richard, [?] and John Frank to
spend the night with me.
