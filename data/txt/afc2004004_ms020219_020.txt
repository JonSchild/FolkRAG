BJ TAPE 6, p. 18

         He jumped up an' hollered to 'im, "This is where I was
bred an' bo'ned at!   Hah!"   Why, he was so glad, ha, ha.   In
the briar patch.
         So that's why the rabbit foolin' him that way.

[*"BRER RABBIT FOOLS BRER BUZZARD"*]

         An' this other one about the rabbit -- the um -- yeah, the
rabbit...He, he wanted some water.   He was so thirsty.   An' he
went to this well, an' they's two buckets on the well.   You
know, they used to have two buckets on the well, a long time
ago, when I was raised up.   Has one, ya draw up one, ya let one
down at the same time.   So he went to this well; he looked down
in there an' he seed this water.   He wanted some water so bad.
So he, he stood up on the side that bucket.   An' the bucket started
down.   He had to grab on it; [it] he had to tilt it, ya know; he
couldn't go back, ya know, without fallin' flat.  So he jus'
held on that bucket an' went on down.   Down in there.  There
wasn' much water down there, jus' a lil' water.   The ol' well
near 'bout dry; jus' a lil' water down there.
         He patted aroun' on the, on the curbin' of the, on the
well an' on that bucket an' he drank an' he drank.   There he
was.   He all, all confused there, ya see.   He sit there an' he
say...He didn' know what to do.   [He say] Didn' know how in the worl' he 
gonna git out. He couldn't climb out, ya know.
         So finally, this ol' buzzard, he flyin' on an' perishin' near
'bout to death. The ol' buzzard flyin'...He say, "Hey! Brer
Buzzard!"   Say, "Man," say, "Is it cool down here.   Come down
here!   It's cool, [there's] the bes' water...Oo, hoo, wah!...Come on down
here.   It's so cool down here!"
         So, ol' Buzzard, he say, "I would like to have a good drink
a water but I'm hongry, too."
