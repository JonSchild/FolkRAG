OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
WILLIAM S. PALEY

August 20, 1941

Dear Mr. Lomax: 

Columbia's withdrawal from the personal management
field has brought to an end an association which we
have prized highly, and I feel that I want to take
this occasion to tell you of my personal regret, and 
of Columbia's, that this change has come about. 

At the same time, I want to assure you that we shall
always have an interest in the success of those
personalities with whom we have been associated in
the past, and that our eagerness to do what we can
to promote the well-being and success of those who
entertain and inform the American public will be
undiminished. 

Sincerely yours, 
William S. Paley
