says, my special papers an' [like that in there] I got it right

TL:          God, Bessie, it's a wonder [one of] your guys didn't get your own 
line, went up there an' hang. . .

BJ:          Yeah, that was a time. . .So, anyhow, Uncle Gene said he went 
in to hisself to pray, an' as he got that ol'                       you know, 
like his mother had, y'know, when she had to pray for him so hard.  
An' ah                                  was prayin' on the ground. 
He said that the Lord show him that now nary one of 'em would live 
a year.   An' they didn't.  Didn't nary one live a year!   Some of

TL:          Is that right!
BJ:          Tha's right.  Every dev'lish one.  They never live a year!  
An so.  So the Lord show him that wa'n' nary one of 'em live a year.

That was in 1909, an' [did] they nary[a one] live a year.  An' so, somethin'

Frankie say she called from Cupeth an' a woman called an' asked 
about her comin' to help her work.   I tol' her "No!"  I said, "You 
come from Cuspeth, I won't work for you nohow."   An' so I tol' 
her that day, I said, "I have a reason; I wouldn't work for nobody 
from [around] that county where everybody know it."  I say, "Every-
body know it."   I said, "Of course, [lot] all  of them ol' folks dead out." 
Jus' as good folks there as ever was, y'see?   But I jus' don' 
wanna work -- I don' have no taste at all. . .for any one of 'em.

BJ:          Yessuh.  I don' have no kinda taste.   I don' even wanna go 
there.  I went there one time since then; that was in 1942, [17] same
