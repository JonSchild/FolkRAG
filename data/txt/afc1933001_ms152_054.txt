Bing Oliver is an elder in the Scase Grease Colored Baptist
church, and lives near the line between Limestone and Huntsville;
Dink Yarbrough, his neighbor, likewise is an elder.  Last summer
the Baptists Assicoation met above Huntsville and near Fayetteville, 
Tenn.  Bing was talking to Dink about the 'sociation, expressed
the desire to go and lamented the lack of a way when Dink told him
that his brother, Schug, had a car and would carry them for $2.00,
so Bing told Dink to have the car at his house by five that morning,
that the 'sociation met an 9 A.M. and closed at two; that he wanted
to get over and meet the bretheren and sisters before the meeting.

Bing was in Livingston, Saturday afternoon and told me of
the trip.  I shall let him tell you:

"Well, Miss dey got to me house a little late dat morning,–
den I went to de car an' us started to git in,  when Shug, he says,
yall haf ter push me off, ––me an' Dink started pushin, an' date kar
shot off likn er fier cracker, an' I axed why, an' det say its back
fiing an' I told 'em I didn't like a kar which back fied, but us ud
push, an' hit would back fier an' us 'ud jump, den push som mo.
After while I got tied pushin', an' 'cided I'd go back home, but
looked round an' twuz so fer back allowrd I'de push some mo.  Den on
de front seat I seed er cheer an' axed Shug whut wuz de cheer fur,
an' he says ter sit on when us fixt punctures, en I axed ef he 'specs
ter haf punctures an' den he says 'spec, hell, I nose we will'.
Twaunt no use ter ax, for 'bout dat time us had four punctures at wun
time, an' Shug, he got de cheer out an' Dinks an' me pulled off an'
pumped up de ties whilst Shug was a settin' down afixin' the punctures.
Den us push to dat Fayettevill country long bout two fifteen,
when de 'sociation is ready broke up an' folks leavin'.  Shug he say,
'Well, us is here, so pay me.'  An' I say, 'PAY HELL, NOBODY RID BUT
YOU.'

At this point I mentionned to Bing that the roads from
Huntsville to Fayetteville were pretty hilly and asked if he didn't
ride down the hills, and he says, "No Miss, dat car didn't haf no
brakes, so us had ter hole it back gwine down hill."

Remembering that the main road to Fayetteville ran through
the business section of Huntsville, and that a longer road circled
the city back to the main highway, I asked him, "How did you get
through Huntsville?" and the spontaneous reply was, "Miss, we went
through Huntsville a pushin'."
