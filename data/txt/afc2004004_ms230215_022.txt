all those who thought
they knew best did
their very best to
parvent the old OSS
or any other OSS
from coming out in 
Padstow. Threats were 
used -- bribery & persuasion.
 but the noble OSS came 
out + they knew if they 
could only parvent it

stop it forever.  But

grateful to the faithful 
band of Padstowian Mayers 
who put the OSS out --
& its been comin out 
ever since -- & [old]
