A Rumor

Once while on my way to school I heard some ladies talking about food rationing. They said that our government was sending all our food to other countries and that later on we would not have enough to eat our selfs. They said that they didn't know why there should be rationing if the United States had plenty of things to eat. They didn't know that the United States only has rationing so that everybody will get his or her fair share. Not that some people get too much and other people none.
