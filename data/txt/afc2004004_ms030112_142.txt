SHUNNA:
Or did he go through that kind of thing?
MRS. DAVIS:
I think you might have it. Many many years ago I don't remember. I wasn't with him, I wasn't married to him when he first was ordained.
LARRY:
I never did talk about that with him.
LIONEL:
Well you was talking about Leadbelly that they knew each other.
LARRY:
Oh yes. Seeing how as I live on the same street Leadbelly was on when he passed. I told Brother Davis about it, I found out Leadbelly's house number, He told me he used to go there you know cause he remembered climbing up the steps you know, he says God Almighty them steps.
