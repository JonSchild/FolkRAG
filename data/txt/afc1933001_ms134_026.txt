Dear Mr. Lomax:
As the Chairman of the Committee on Arrangements for the recent breakfast given by the Colorado State Society, may I take this opportunity to thank you most sincerely for contributing so much to the success of the breakfast.
I am sure everyone present enjoyed both your songs and your explanations as much as I did -- and that is a great deal.

With best wishes, I am
Sincerely yours
