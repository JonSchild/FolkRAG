My dear Professor Rickard,
I have your letter of the 20th, telling me of
your interest in the songs and dances of the Tennessee
Mountains and asking me what aid the Library of Congress
can give you in this work.
The Library of Congress is vitally interested in 
the collecting of American folk-song and the formation
of a great central collection of such material.  With
these ends in view, there has been established within the
Library an “Archive of American Folk-Song.”  At the present
time the work of the “Archive” is being directed by Mr.
John A. Lomax, Honorary Consultant and Curator.  May I
suggest, then, that you write to Mr. Lomax, who is
already acquainted with your work, addressing him at
University Station, Austin, Texas.  In the meantime, I
shall send Mr. Lomax a copy of your letter.
Very sincerely yours,
Chief
Division of Music
