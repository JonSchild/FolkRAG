Lubbock, Texas.

Mr. Carl Engel, 
Library of Congress, 
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr Engel:
So as not to lose any time we are temporarily starting to work at once with a  spring motor Dictaphone. By using  a microphone under proper conditions all the worthwhile songs we record by means of the Dictaphone can be re-recorded for the Library on permanent records. As soon as you can send me word of the time that the new machine will be ready, I will send you shipping directions. 

New Orleans would seem the most likely place. Warwick writes of a two week delay and you of a delay of three weeks; and, since I will be traveling most of that time on my folk-song hunt, I cannot yet give you a definite address. But you can reach me most promptly at University Station, Austin by mail; by wire c/o E.R. Pedigo, Austin, Texas.

Yours sincerely
John A. Lomax
