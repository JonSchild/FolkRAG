that hymn. Suffice it to say it was first published
in Charles Wesley's Funeral Hymns
(first series), No. V, six stanzas, in 1746,
entitled "On the Sight of a Corpse." This
number does not belong in a collection of
folk songs.   - ROBERT G. McCUTCHAN.

CALLING ALL CHRISTIANS AND 
OTHER SERMONS. Edited by PAUL
ZELLER STRODACH. (Muhlenberg
Press. Price, $1.75.)

Here is a collection of Lenten sermons
preached by some of the outstanding ministers
of the United Lutheran Church. Of
the eighteen sermons in this volume, there
is not one which can be characterized as
notably inferior. All are both devotional
and practical and constitute a cross-section
of American preaching at its best.
-REX PARKE LEWIS.

As They Come

Where God Meets Man by O.A. Geiseman
(Ernest Kaufmann, Inc., New York and
Chicago; price, $1.50) is the second volume
to appear under this title. The first contained
sermons covering the Sundays from
Easter to Advent. Now comes a complementary
volume giving sermons for the Sundays
from Advent to Easter. The author has
been pastor of Grace Lutheran Church, River
Forest, Ill., for the  past nineteen years.

The extent of the renaissance of Christian
worship which is now taking place in American 
churches is indicated by the appearance
of two volumes representing the nonliturgical
Baptist churches, both North and South, 
Worship in the Churches, by William Roy
McNutt (Judson Press; price, $2) and Worship, 
Why and How? by Ernest O. Sellers
of the Baptist Bible Institute, New Orleans
(Zondervan, Grand Rapids, Mich.; price,
$1). Both contain excellent suggestions about
this movement, particularly for smaller
churches which are just awakening to its
importance. The authors show an acquaintance
with the best recent literature.

The late J.R. Miller was one of the most
helpful of American devotional writers. The 
Home Beautiful (Zondervan; price, $1.50)
reproduces his informed and understanding
comments on a variety of themes which have
to do with the founding and development of
Christian family life.

Short Sermons for Children, by Dan Huntington
Fenn (Putnam's; price, $2) consists
of happy moralistic talks on multifarious
themes, one for each Sunday of the year.
The author as pastor of Unitarian churches
and professor in Harvard Divinity School
cannot be expected to lay stress on biblical
revelation or evangelical ideology.

The Reformation, seen as a social revolutions, 
furnishes the thesis unfolded by the
late Ernest Sutherland Bates in his American
Faith: Its Religious, Political, and Economic
Foundations. (W.W. Norton and 
Company; price, $3.75.) Here is one
scholar who recognizes religion as a major
factor in the development of the American
ideal. Especially fascinating are the chapters
on "The Creedless Frontier" and "The
Rowdy Church of the Latter Day Saints."
It should be added that the deliciously accurate
adjective "rowdy" was also applicable
to most of the Methodists, Baptists, and
Disciples who lived in the period described.

Building Rural Communities (University
of Chicago Press; price $2) sets forth the
proceedings of the American Country Life-
Conference in its twenty-third session at
Lafayette, Ind., in November, 1940. Here
may be found informed comment on the
changes taking place in rural areas, together
with constructive suggestions.

POEMS FOR THE TIMES

WEALTH
By Virginia Scott Miner

How does the moon regard the earth?
Does any planet own an eye?
If not, then are we rich beyond
The wealth of lordly sky?

RAIN DREAM
By Grace Sayre

A cloud
Gray as a shroud
Is sewn by steel-point needles
Of the rain;
And again,
Its torn and fraying seam
Supplies the theme
For a rain-dream.

SYMPHONY
By Hazel I. Dannecker

To you, who love them so,
Your bed of woodland violets becomes
A great keyboard of notes
Upon which you play in ordered sequence
Expressing by varied accents
Many shades of emotion
In manifold keys of color.

I have watched you living
In a dream land,
Fascinated by depth of tones
Other eyes could not see,
Your own face revealing
Depth, movement, worshipful delight,
Your spirit apart with Nature's God
In a mysterious, heavenly world.

MY FAITH
By John Don

My soul has late received
A telling blow. And much that I hold dear
For present and for future days has disappeared.
Castles and dreams, visions of hope
Looming skyward from the mist, have flickered
And returned to endless shadows, so it seems.
What then? Despair? Impassioned bitterness?
My faith says "No!" for mists of night
Are harbingers of dawn and better things. 
The darkness of dead hope will silhouette
New light. My bruised soul will find
New peace and higher dreams fulfilled
In God's good time. And I can wait 'til then!
