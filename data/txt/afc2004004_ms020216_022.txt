'em back from that. They jes' don't,  [they don't] you know -- Now a lot
of Missionary Baptist womens goin' out, missionaries, ya know.

all they know how, and, and...

BJ:     Oh, no, they don't ah, in the, in the sermons, [that] 'less
there's something that they got to on the women's part, an' we
does, too.  Womens part.  'Cause we has a women's -- regular
women's part in our church.  Regular women's part. [Because] 
Of co'se
the mens he'ps us, an' like we he'p them.  We he'p us one to
another.  But we has our, our inofficial uh, uh, mother -- we call it
mother -- our, our inofficial mother.  Tha's Mother Coffin, ya
see?  She's the head official of the whole Church of God [and] in
Christ all over the Union -- far and wide!   Tha's right.  An'
every one that comes in,[is] they say, "I'm a Church of God [and] in
Christ in Unity...I'm a Church of God in Christ Union Heaven (?)...

that name Church of God in Christ, 'cause it's 'stablished from
us, you see?  You gonna come in to that headquarters.  Jus'
take the Church of God in Christ off.  'Cause it's written.
You ain' gonna take half of my name an go, an' go another way
with it, see?  So that's right.  See what I mean?
