But finally, in an attempted bank robbery at Round Rock, Texas, twenty miles
north of Austin, the Capitol City, through the treachery of one of his companions,
on July 21, 1887, he "met his fate." In a fight with a company of Texas Rangers
Sam was mortally wounded, and he died the next day, refusing to the last to give
the names of his associates who fled. His purse contained the last twenty dollar
gold piece of his share of the Union Pacific Railway swag. His pistol and belt,
now in the University of Texas Museum, still holds the thirteen unshot cartridges

is famous chiefly because Sam Bass, cowboy, horse-racer, free spender, robber, lost
his life in an attempt to rob its only bank.

As for the song, it sprang from the people. No one has ever claimed to be its
author. Its sources are as mysterious and unknown as the Texas grasses that grow
above his grave, rustling and whispering in the Texas Northers that sweep through
them on long wintry nights.

During cattle trail days, in Texas, 1868-1892, every singing cowboy carried Sam
Bass in his repertoire. The tune is typically of the western ballad breed, drawl-
