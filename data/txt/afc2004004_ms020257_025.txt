thing got on 'em in the houses an' everything.  They couldn't
do nothin'.  He give up that; he was gonna let 'em go.  An' time
he did that, God hardened his heart.  It didn't say Pharoah
hardened his heart.  Said God hardened it.  See, now if God hardened
it, he couldn't help but say, "No, I ain't gonna let 'em. go."
Ya see?  Now, he doin' that to [show 'em] come on down to show
'em He, what He could do.  Not you, ya know, let my chillun go;
[*(COLOR PROBLEM:  WHITE & BLACK)*]
I'll let 'em go.  Ya see what I mean?  If He done let Pharoah let
'em go, it's been today, man could let peoples go free.  You see?
He know that.  That's why he wouldn't let Pharoah let 'em go; He
hardened his heart; he just wouldn't let 'em go.  An' ah, an'
every time he give up, said, "Now, if I let Pharoah go . . . "An' He
see the time, he see the time from the time, the end.  If He'd a - let
Pharoah do that, right now, you could forgive me or you could, ah,
you know, let me go free.  I don't mean free in the world.  I
mean ta loose me.  An' but, He did that.  Then when,
ah, Pharoah jus' wouldn't, He got behind 'im an' jus', jus'
drownded him.  "Now I'm gonna show ya I'm the one who gonna set those
chillun free," see?  "I, I'm gonna set 'em free." He set 'em
free, at, at the sea, ya know.
AL:  You said that there weren't any white people before. . .
BJ:  No, before sin.  An' I have read about it, in the Bible.
Sin come.  Sin was already here but be-before the great sin.  I
better read that to you; you might not believe it.  Hah!  That's
in the Bible, see.  [I better (?)] I'm gonna read it to you.  The word of
white folks -- you know what I'm talkin' about -- the word that
we use, white folks, they ain't no such thing as white folks,
see.  They ain't no such thing as black folks, ya see.  It's 
just the word that we use that way.  You're not white folks.
