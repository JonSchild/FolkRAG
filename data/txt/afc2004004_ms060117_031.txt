Dear Sirs:
On the 19th of June Mr. J.D. Elder shipped
two packages of film to me care of the Admin-
istrator at Roseau, Dominica.  The waybill
number was 106 321366.  I failed to receive
this film at its delivery point and have been
trying to lay hands on it ever since.  If
you will be kind enough to look into this
matter and ship the package to me at the
above address, I will be happy to pay what-
ever charges are necessary.  When you have
found the film, I would be happy if you
would be so kind as to notify me.
Very truly yours,
Alan Lomax
