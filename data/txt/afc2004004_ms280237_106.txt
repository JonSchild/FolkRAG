11/
Did you ever hear talk of a good luck ship,
Did you ever hear talk of the commander's name,
She's the Royal Rainbow from Bristol town
And Captain Ramsgate was his name.

This good luck ship she was loaden deep,
Three anchors weight all on her bow,
An' the wind bein' east north east, my boys,
As close to the wind as she could lay.

Now we had not sailed three leagues or more
Before we spied ten men o' war,
Before we spied ten men o' war,
And unto us they did huzzaw.

Come strike, come strike, you English dogs.
Come strike you topsail down by speed."
"If you have a mind for to have them strike,
Come you on board strike them for me.
 
Then he called up his merry men all,
Sayin', "Get you ready and obey my call,
Get your firelocks ready and fix them well,
And throw in plenty of bomshell."

Then he called up his cabin boy,
An' sent him up aloft so high,
And there let fly King George's flag
And under that we'll fight or die.

From the sun rising till the sun going down,
We fight like enemies where we do meet,
From the sun rising till the sun going down,
We spied but one sail from the fleet.

Three we sank and three we burned,
The other three they ran away,
And one we brought to old England's shore,
To let them know we'd won the day.

So now thank God we have won this day,
We've caused the French all for to rue.
Here s Captain Ramsgate an' all his crew,
Let's everyone give a good huzzaw,

Lomax: Oh, wonderful; really wonderful tune. What war is that of,
Harry ?
Cox: I can't. . . .I ain't. . .I don't know what it mean at all.
Lomax: Just a good sea fight, eh?
