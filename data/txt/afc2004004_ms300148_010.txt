Dear Wade:
Enclosed is a check for $15 in payment for the
song, "Chilly Winds" which will be used in one of the
set of albums. I hope that they will be able to use
another song of yours in the same set and that I can
soon mark the rest of your material.
About the banjo, please have the owner take a snapshot
of it and air mail it to me right away so that I can
decide whether I want to buy it or not. Is it in
playing condition? This is most urgent.
Yours affectionately,
Alan Lomax
