Mrs. Emmet Womer - R. R. No. 2 - Bellaire, Kansas

Oct - 2 - 1946
Dear Sir:-
Enclosed you will find
the music that you wanted or
the notes that Mrs. George Dolecek
wrote off for me. As you wrote in your
last letter Sept 26 - You noticed that it
was the chorus that was changed in
regard to the tune. And you will
note that also some change in the
verse also that the work clouded is
the correct way. I hope this may be of
benifit to you and that you might
get to send your story to the
music magazine. I am enclosing
the article that was in Kans City Star
at the time of the "law suit" when Samuel Moanfeldt
was out here and got these interviews of
the ones who knew about this old song.
the picture is of my father. please do send
