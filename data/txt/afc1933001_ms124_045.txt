Superintendent of Schools

Fleming County, Kentucky

Dear Mr. Evans:

For the past several years the Library of Congress has been
engaged in building an Archive of American Folk-Song, to serve
as a national depository for phonograph records of American
folk-music, that is, the old ballads, reels, hymns, cowboy songs
and the like that have been handed down from generation to generation
or have been composed by and sung by people without the
aid of writing or print.

The Library has already accumulated thousands of songs from
all over the country, particularly from the Southern States, but
Eastern Kentucky, which we believe to be very rich in this type
of material, is not very well represented in our collection. For
that reason I am being sent to Eastern Kentucky on the first of
September for a two months survey of the folk-music in this section.
I shall bring with me a portable machine that makes excellent
records and I will be interested in meeting and recording
the singing, the fiddling or the dancing of all the individuals
who know the old songs, tunes or dances. When these records
shall have been made, they will be deposited in the Library of
Congress for the use, instruction and pleasure of the American
people.

I feel sure that you, as county superintendent of schools, can
be of great assistance to the Library in your section of Kentucky.
It is not unlikely that you know many people who are good singers
or good fiddlers and perhaps some occasion, such as a Sacred Harp
Singing Meet or an old fiddlers' contest or a family reunion that
would be interesting to me and where the Library's project could be
furthered.

I should greatly appreciate a letter from you giving me whatever
information you can in regard to the music of your county and
