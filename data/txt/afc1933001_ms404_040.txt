[*11*]

Well God sent the noneteenth angel
From the floors of glory
To work among the beasts and the folkses,
Well, God sent the noneteenth angel
From the floors of glory
To help old Norah build the ark.
Was a-building this ark one hundred and twenty years-ah,
Had one hundred and twenty nails to drive,
Had one hundred and twenty rooms to complete.
Says, "O Norah,
What you been doing, well,
All this time-ah?"
"Been teaching the people to repent.
My God's gonna 'stroy this world by water.
Says, called me a fool all over this land,
But Old Man Careful,
Building for a home in the kindom land."

Where you bound?
I'm bound
Kingdom land.
Where you bound?
I'm bound
Kingdom land.

Just as this man finished his exhortation
in the chapel, an attending white guard
leaned over to me and enquired:
   "Do you know what that preacher is
in this pen for?"
      "No"
   "He drowned his son in order to
collect a hundred dollars in life insurance."
