O cradle me on your knee, Mama
And sing me that holy song,
Song that soothee me last
As you fondly pressed my cheek to your 
loving breast
For I saw a scene as I slumbered last 
I fain would see again.

No address - they run bills & skip their bills.
A kind of peculiar family, but awful good at singing.
