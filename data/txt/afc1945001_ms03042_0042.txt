- 13 - Rumors, 8-3 to 8-8 New York 8-14-42

Buffalo 8-5 (Physician, Army Reserve Officer): "I just came back
from duty in an Army Camp a little while ago. Most of my medical experience 
is devoted to treating the boys for hysterics. Lots of them get hysterical
during bayonet practice. They will have to get a lot tougher than they
are now."

Poughkeepsie 8-5 (Radio announcer): "Petrillo is supported by the 
President in this fight against radio. The President is not satisfied
with his control of radio and wants greater control, so that he can become
a complete dictator. But Ham Fish can stop him."

New York 8-8: "My friends and I feel that the President has
deliberately put aside important war work to participate in the New York
State political fight."

Yonkers 8-8: "The President has given three days of the past
week to the New York political campaign. I saw that in the paper. Isn't
it a scandal, with us losing the war and everything. No wonder we're
losing."

Long Island City 8-5 (German-American): "Harry Hopkins is a 
heavy drinker, and so is the President. That's why they have surrounded
themselves with drunkards for heads of the Army, Navy and WPB, and that's
why we will lose this war. Churchill is a heavy drinker, too. You never
heard of Hitler, Mussolini or the Emperor of Japan taking a drink."

Long Beach 8-6: "Why does New York bother about blackouts and 
dimouts? Any enemy plane could spot anything on or near Manhattan Island
by following the rivers. So why bother?"

New York 8-7: "The OPA is wasting thousands of dollars a week
by hiring people at high salaries. They are paying everyone more than they
got in private jobs or other government jobs. Joe told me a friend of his
who got $2000 in the Commerce Department was given a $4600 job in OPA."
