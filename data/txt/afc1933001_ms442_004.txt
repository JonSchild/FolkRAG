Long come Bill Martin wid his cold 41..

Talk: Bill Martin was a long and slender man---- And he wasn'
nothin' but a professional gambler----- And Ella Speed [3/4] she was one
of the star women---- which everybody loved Ella Speed and everybody
liked Bill Martin----- but Bill Martin wouldn' hit a lick at a snake
which was a bartender an' a professional gambler----

Come all and take heed,
Just remember the death of Ella Speed,
Come all and take heed,
Just remember the death of Ella Speed,

The deed that Bill Martin done,
Was cold blooded murder with his [Colt] cold 41.

The wi[k]mmens was all singing wid a doneful [song] sound,
When Bill Martin shot de woman down,
The wimmen's was all singing wid a doneful sound,
When Bill Martin shot de woman down.
