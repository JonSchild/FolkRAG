Dear Sir:

           The Rumor Clinic plan, first publicized by the American Mercury
in connection with the work of the Massachusetts Division of Propaganda
Research, seems likely to find nation-wide acceptance.  Wouldn't it be
desirable for the OWI to take these local groups under its wing at least
to the extent of acting as a clearing house for information and as an
advisory body?  Many rumors must have national distribution and so would be brought to the attention of many local clinics.  Instead of having each clinic trying to cehck on the rumor with the Arm, Navy, OEM, etc. why couldn't the local group report directly to the OWI?  The OWI would then make the proper checks and send the necessary information to the local clinics.

          Specifically, the "Rumor Clinic Division" of the OWI might function in this way:
   1. Local Rumor Clinics regularly report rumors to the OWI. The rumors are sorted on the basis of frequency and distribution.
   2. Rumors having wide currency would be checked by the OWI with the proper authorities.
   3. The OWI would then supply all the local clinics reporting such rumors
with the necessary information (if available) for the refutation of the rumors.
         There are doubtlessly difficulties in this procedure but I think
the plan has these merits. 1) It would save time and effort by avoiding a
multiple duplication of labor.  2) The OWI is better able to get information
than local groups are. 3) If the OWI handled the releases it could apply the necessary censorship at the source. 4) The fact that the refutations were issued by the OWI would increase their prestige. 5) Regular reports from
local clinics would keep the OWI in close and constant touch with the people.  It would also help to give the OWI an over-all national picture at any given time.

         My motive in suggesting this plan is primarily a desire to help, but I confess also to a less altruistic interest.  If you find the plan feasible will you consider my application for a part in carrying it out?

                                                                               Yours truly,
                                                                               [*signature*]
