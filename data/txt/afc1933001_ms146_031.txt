Clemson, South Carolina,
June 26, 1939.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
I want to thank you for your
letter of June 20th; I appreciate it very much.
I would like also to tell you, as I have told
Mr. Lomax, that I am greatly interested in
what you are doing and if at any time I can do 
anything to help you in this section, I will
be delighted. I hope the Lomaxes will come back.

Very truly yours, 
Ben Robertson.
Ben Robertson.
