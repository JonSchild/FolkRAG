Boll Weevil Song

1.  Oh, de boll weevil am a little black bug,
Come from Mexico, dey say,
Come all de way to Texas
Jus' a-lookin' foh a place to stay,
Jus' a-lookin' foh a home
Jus' a-lookin' foh a home

2.  De first time I seen de boll weavil,
He was a-settin' on de square.
De next time I seen de boll weevil,
he had all of his family dere.
Jus' a lookin' foh a home.

3.
De farmer say to de weevil:
"What make yo' head so red,"
De weevil say to de farmer,
"It's a wondah I ain't dead,
A-lookin' foh a home,
Jus' a lookin' foh a home."

4.  De farmer take de boll weevil,
An' he put him in de hot san'.
De weevil say: "Dis is might hot,
but I'll stan' it like a man,
Dis'll be my home, it'll be my home."

5.  De farmer take de boll weevil,
An' he put him in a lump of ice;
De boll weevil say to de farmer:
"Dis is mighty cool and nice,
It'll be my home, dis'll be my home."

6.  De farmer take de boll weevil,
An' he put him in de fire.
De boll weevil say to do farmer:
"here I are, here I are,
Dis'll be my home, dis'll be my home."

7. De boll weevil say to de farmer:
"You better leave me alone;
I done eat all yo' cotton
now I'm goin' to start on yo' corn,
I'll have a home, I'll have a home."

8.  De merchant got half de cotton,
De boll weevil got de res'.
Didn't leave de farmer's wife
but one old cotton dress,
An' it's full of holes,
It's full of holes.

9.  De farmer say to de merchant:
"We's in an awful fix;
De boll weevil et all de cotton up
An' lef' us Only sticks,
We's got no home, we's got no home."

10.  De farmer say to de merchant;
"We ain't made but only one bale,
And befoh we'll give yo' dat one
we'll fight and go to jail,
We'll have a home, we'll have a home.

11.  De cap'n say to de missus:
"Wat d' you t'ink l' date,
De boll weevil dont make a nes'
in my bes' Sunday hat,
Goin' to have a home, goin' to have a home.

12.  An' if anybody should ax you
Who it was dat make dis song,
Jus' tell 'm 'twas a big buck niggah
wid a paih o' blue duckin's on,
Ain' got no home, ain' got no home.

Bombed
We were bombed last night,
Bombed the night before,
And we're gonna be bombed tonight
as we never were bombed before.
When we're bombed,
we're as scared as we can be,
They can bomb the whole darn army
if they don't bomb me.

Chorus:
They're over us, over us,
One little cave for the four of us,
Golry be to God, there are no more of us
Or they'd surely bomb the whole darned crew.


The Minstrels Sing of an English King

Oh, the minstrels sing of an English King of many years ago,
Oh, he ruled his land with an iron hand
But his mind was weak and low.
He loved to chase the bounding stag
throughout the royal wood,
But his favorite occupation
was pulling something good.

The Old Plantation X

Old plantation how I love you;
'neath your trees I seem to roam
My heart yearns just to return to my
old plantation home

Old plantation nani oe
Home pume hana i kialoha
I kao lu oka niu I kapoli oke ona-ona.
