Roll 43 Stan and Ray Hicks                3

(Ray) room where the daughter was at. So he sent one of the other
kids to get the glass a half or a third full of water. And he got
it down side the bed and shook it, and the blubbers went right to
the bottom, and then back top. And she's gonna die...Death was on
her! And he got that sack opened up the side of her bed where
she was layin' back and said: "wickitywack, Death! Would you pleas[e]
come down in this sack!" And Death went down in there and he shut
it, and she jumped up, runnin' around like she never been sick.
Stan: That really tickled him to death!
Ray: Ooh God! And she was beautiful! Well! And so, he tried to
pay him everythin' it was, and he said, "No, I won't take nothin'!
This ain't for pay." So he went back home to his place he got.
There's a big poplar tree, in the yard out front. He climbed that
tree plum far as he could get to the top, and tied that sack in it,
and kept his mouth shut. Left it tied up in there. And it went on
and on, and on...it got to be a million years, gone, and nobody
hadn't died! Theys all here. And gosh they was in the awfullest
shape you ever seed people, and Jack was! Gosh, he was a lookin'
pretty rough!
Stan: Gettin' old.
Ray: Yeah. He's lookin' (unint.)...He wasn't a screekin' so bad ye
like some. Finally it hit his mind, he was a workin' there and he
took out one day to see if it might help his nerves, a walkin',
limber up a little, and change the way, the situation he'd been a 
livin' on the farm there and what he been doin', he'd been carried
away! Gettin' limber, it might help him to walk on the old public
road, what they call the public road, built by public people.
Stan: Built of free labor.
