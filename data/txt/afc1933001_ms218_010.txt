8/28/1939, 
Dear Alan: For two cents a 
record and a hundred dollar 
advance I have agreed to 
Mr. Wetherall  to come on to 
Washington from Niagara 
Falls, Canada, instead of 
going on to Texas via Detroit 
as we had planned. I have 
told him he could write 
me there. 

I am still very sure 
that I will not guarantee 
Columbia against some
fake [???] suing them for 
misuse of material. For 
a big corporation it 
is always open season.
