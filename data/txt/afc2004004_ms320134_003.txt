carnival means farewell to meet. It's the last time you can
kick the gong around before lent. And were they doing it.

You see that peaked hat there? You see those
masks? Well, that's what old Europe always did after the 
winter. They had a big celebration. There was so much, the
feeling they're being so much they had to literally beat the
devil out of each other. And that explains why this strange
habit of these men slapping each other around with ropes,
this is going on all over this area, northwest, in southwest
Louisiana now.

Carnival is a really French and Mediterranean 
Europe festival that goes back into the dark ages past any
knowing actually. It's basically a pagan feast permitted by
the church with somewhat ill grace. And, but the Cajuns
have made a new form of it. Descendants of ranchers and as
they are they put the festival on horseback. And they get 
up early in the morning, the band of people from a
neighborhood and make a circuit through the neighborhood
going to different houses of all their friends and asking
for a contribution to mardi gras. This of course happened
in old Europe when bands of poor people sang their way
through the, this fast. But these people ask for a
contribution. They, they, and the captain rides down to the
house because you dare not cross a Cajun border line without
permission. These people are very, very property conscious.
