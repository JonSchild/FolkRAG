What new book is that sweeping
the country? ration book two

A soldier the Japs had captured
wrote his mother a letter and
told he to save the stamps
for his stamp collection, but he
didn't have any stamp collection.
His mother took of the stamp 
and underneath the stamp the 
solider had written that the 
Japs had cut his tounge out.
