Dear Mr. Lomax:
Thanks for forwarding my letter to your
father. I really should like to see my bibliographies
do full justice to his current publication out[[??]], but, as you
see, that almost requires his cooperation. 
Unfortunately I do not have any recording apparatus, 
nor am I able to take down music, so I guess I shan't be
getting any folk music on this trip. However, I'm keeping my
eye open for any broadsides. But they usually have words
only.
Thanks for your kind good wishes. 
Sincerely,
R[[??]] Boggs
