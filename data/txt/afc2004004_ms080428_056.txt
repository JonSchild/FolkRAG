A:  These wonderful green hills have been the scene of one of the most ah exciting and productive ah cultural experiments of the last 200 years.  In this co - land um, people came ah bearing strains of ah the Norse adventurer, of Celtic fantasy, of the Protestant revolution, that helped to free mankind from the old tyrannies of kings and emperors, and ah, they brought with them, ah - they'd been often considered impoverished culturally, but they bought with them their whole treasury of, of British balladry, which after all caused the romantic revolution and inspired Keats and Shelley.  They also brought with them the tune bag of the Celtic world, probably the richest ah tune memory ah that we have in, in - on the planet.

They also brought with them ah, an, an incredible hardihood and ability to adapt, to adjust to the most onerous of conditions and to, to keep ah rebounding with vitality and originality to everything that faced them.  The history's really fascinating.
