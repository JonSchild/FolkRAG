Mr. T. G. Hopkins
Railway Express Agency
Wilton, Conn.

Deart Mr. Hopkins:

On February 19, 1935, the Library of Congress shipped a
package express prepaid to me at Wilton, Conn. Upon receipt
of this same package, I had to pay express charges of $8.84/
Thus the charges were paid twice.

On March 11, Mr. Croft, Chief of the Mailing Division of
the Library of Congress wrote to the Railway Express Agency in
Washington, D. C. and explained this matter. He received, on
March 14, a letter signed by the Superintendent of that office,
which read in part:

"The certificate is being referred to our agent
at Wilton, Connecticut, who will arrange for refund
to Mr. John A. Lomax of the charges collected at time
of delivery."

To date I have heard nothing further in the matter. Just
at present I am in Washington, and I would appreciate your letting
me hear from you so that the matter may be settled. My
address here is c/o Music Division, Library of Congress, Washington,
D. C.

Thanking you, I am
