BJ:     That's very important to me, um-hum.  Also my daughter,
too. I an' my daughter played together when we -- when she
was little, an' I was little with her, ya know.  Yeah, she never
got abase an' never have lift up her voice to me in her life.
An' so that's real important to me...Yes it is.  Yessir....We
played together.  An' never [had no trouble at all.] have lift up her voice.  An' she ain't
got near about as many whuppin's as I had, ya know?  In a 
way of speakin'.  I didn't have to have 'em, but ya know, I come
up 'way, 'way on the other side of there, ya know?  I ain't got
too many, myself. [But] You know, but yet an' still, she didn't have to
get none, hardly.  'Cause she ain't got a whuppin' since she was
8 year old. 
TL:     Is that right?
BJ:     Since she was 8 year old.
TL:     Who [did you] used to whip her?
BJ:      Nobody but me.  I reckon Mama mighta whipped 'er a time or 
two.  But Mama -- She stayed with Mama, ya know, for years, ya
know, at the time.  But she ain't got many, nohow.  I know Mama
didn' whip her much 'cause Mama didn't want me to whup 'er.  Hum,
hum. Yeah, Mama didn't want me to whip 'er. 
         She had stayed with Mama about 3 years an' ah, an' I wasn't
there, ya know.  I jus', ah, ah, in Georgia? She was at Millen
(Milan) an' I was back up, you know, around, Fitzgerald and Abbottville, where I 
tell you about.  And so, hit's came to be 3 years an' 6 months. 
I hadn't been there; I hadn't seen her.  An' so when I went there, 
that [day] made my daughter feel like, you know, Mama was her mama, not
me.  You know.  Oh, boy! She done felt that way, ya know.  So I
was watchin' 'er, diffrunt lil' things, tellin' what to do around 
the house.  Mama had a big house, I tell you all these chickens
