you something that happened recently.   (He plays)
.......I went and recorded ...la prison, then we went to 
the Hudon River Revival, I told them, I said I'm gonna
try somthig, I'm gonna chop that thing up, and I'm gonna
play it on the stage and if the people like it, then I
am going to record it.....
AL:   Neither Bob or Nick ever heard that Bala prison(?)  Why
don't you show them a little bit......(he plays)
(he sings)
AL:   What was your daddy's favorite tune?
Canray:   It looked to me when I was coming up that he would
enjoy whatever he was playing.   What was his favorite tune,
I don't know....Just like, we went to France last year
and they was asking me if I knew about.......(he plays).
When it was a great big deal, he was getting ten dollars to 
play somewhere, I don't even know where it's located at, but 
they got a poulet or a jack(?) and they got some white
people that come in, say Amadie, you gonna play for us?
And he says, if I'm the artist, it's pulet or jack(?)   I 
remember that good....which he recorded a record, but he 
called it the traveler's blues or something like that. And 
it's the same tune but he was singing something different.
Well, he says, this Amadie, come on.   And they had that white
lightening....(he plays)  (he sings)   Oh yeah, poor Amadie, he
was a nice guy.   The only thing, he was a little man, you know,
