One moment yet!  one moment yet!
Brave heart thy task is o'er!
The pebbles grate beneath the keel,
The steamer touches shore.
Three hundred grateful voices rise,
In praise to God that He
Hath saved them from the fearful fire,
And from the engulfing sea.
                                                  11
But where is he, that helmsman bold?
The captain saw him reel - 
His nerveless hands released his task,
He sunk beside the wheel.
The waves received his lifeless corpse,
Blackened with smoke and fire, 
God rest him! Hero never had 
A nobler funeral pyre!
