Dear Professor Warner:

I received your letter of March 9th and
your recent note of March 18th. I am sorry not
to have the prospect of seeing you again until
the autumn.

The proposal set forth in your memorandum
accompanying your letter of March 9th is extremely
interesting. Its outline is somewhat similar to
a plan that the Civilian Mobilization Division of
O.C.D. is trying to work out. It is a pity that
more is not known about the worthwhile activities
of that organization

At the present time OCD has nine regional
directors. Each region corresponding to the Army
Air Corps Area. These directors are supplied with
the pattern or plan for protection prepared by the
Protective Division of the OCD and their job is to
encourage the formation of State Defense Councils
operating downward through Councils on the community
level and providing them with guidance and instruction
wherever necessary of requested. Unfortunately,
they have no actual authority.

I believe that the Civilian Mobilization
Division is now being rapidly whipped into shape.
It would have been extremely useful, I think, for
you to talk either with Dan Landis or Jonathan
Daniels, who is head of the Civilian Mobilization
Division.
