sold in America. They 
were sponsored by 
the English Folk Song 
& Dance Society at  whose 
festivals I have sung 
in London & the provinces. 
My songs are unaccompanied 
& I wondered if you 
would be interested 
in hearing them.
Since then, I have 
acquired a guitar & now 
play my own accompaniments. 
I am a frequent broadcaster 
from Cardiff & the other 
regions.
I do hope your 
song hunt is not nearly 
over & that we shall 
have the pleasure of 
keeping you in Britain 
for a long time yet. 
Yours sincerely,
Genie Lewis.
