Instead of being bound to one plantation the tenant is bound to an area or a 
group of plantations which are similar in their characteristics. 

One of the most serious hazards the Delta County cotton producer 
faces is the river. The overflows of the Mississippi were beneficial in the 
formation of this fertile region, but they become a definite menace when they 
threaten the destruction of everything that has been established on its alluvial 
Delta. Despite the precautionary measures described [*taken*] in the Levee System 
to protect the farms, the river has accumulated force at flood stage to break 
through and spread destruction. In 1927 the flood occurred, inundating miles 
of the cotton country, destroying crops, driving farmers to the highlands 
for safety, and damaging property. At Scott, where the Delta and Pine Lands 
Company has developed one of the most efficient organizations in the world 
for cotton production, the water came in, driving sharecroppers, overseers, 
managers, office force, cotton specialists and officers out, and covering 
the fields with several feet of water. 

The boll weevil, chief pest menace to the cotton crop in the Delta, 
has been more effectively controlled than natural hazards. Poisons have been 
developed which stop the invasion before it spreads. Control of the weevil 
constitutes a considerable item in the cost of production. The larger plantations 
use airplanes to "dust" their fields with poison. 

A third risk is the market. The price of cotton depends on the 
world market, and demands for the crop are measured by prices established in 
New York and Liverpool. The Delta farmers plant their crop and follow it 
through the harvest with little assurance as to the returns. It has no value 
to the producers except in its exchange value. During the World War period
