Tom: No. They just said - We died of bronchitis - thousands
have gone to their graves that got the same disease that
I've got.  The doctors used to call it Mines Consumption owing
to coal dust.  But the same thing was happening to them.  In time
if forms in a stone in your constitution.
You get compensation according to the stage you've got.
Lomax: How much compensation did you get,?
G      : I'm coming under the old act, see. I get [L]2.17.4.
because I'm a married man.
Tom: I get [L]2.0.0.
Lomax: Can you live on that?
Tom: No - no. But that'll come to a termination like because
the Labour Party only extended it for the period they were in.
So now it's come back to the mean Test since July 4th this year.
- there's many numbers have some now.  Now they get only
partial compensation.
Lomax: What do you think is the solution?
Tom: If the dole and insurance doesn't pay - 
Lomax: But for a man who's got silicosis from the mines - 
what do you think they should do?
Tom: He should be guaranteed his money from the colliery
as well as his insurance.  And they can't find you a job to
suit the disease you've got.
G            : They tell you on your form - 'Fit for light work
in the open only. 
what a hope!
Tom: You've got no hope at all.  Thousands is out.
G     : And you know who sent the police down to S. Wales
when they had the notes there? Churchill- and he was
the man that sent the soldiers down and he dare not come
down there.  They'd lynch him. I'd lynch the bugger now if
he was here even if he is 80!
