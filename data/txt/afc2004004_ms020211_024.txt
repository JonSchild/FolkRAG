QUERIES

Michael Ranson
R. L. P. inquires: "In 'Tragedy'
by William G. McCollom, the author refers
to a Michael Ransom in the 
sentence, 'Michael Ransom immediately
reads aloud from 
Dante and adds pessimistic footnotes.'
In the context of the

Ransom would seem to be a
character in a play.  Can any
reader identify him?"

Novel
H. E. G. writes:  "I should
like to know the title and author
of a novel published 10 to
15 years ago, which concerned
a group of summer residents of
a peninsula on the northeast
coast of New England who suddenly
find themselves cut off
from the rest of the world and
transported backward in time.
Former social distinctions are

reversed, and the gardener and
mechanic become more valuable
to the community than the 
banker and lawyer."
_____

what context spoke of the mind
as 'an intellectual pelvic girdle
Miltonically wide'?"

June."

ANSWERS

My Father
CHENG LOK CHUA, Storrs,
Conn., writes:  "The lines
that P. S. (Oct. 18) quotes
are from Shakespeare's 'Henry
IV,' Part II, Act V, scene 2,
beginning with line 123.  The
full sentence reads:
And, princes all, believe me,
I beseech you,
My father is gone wild into
his grave,
For in his tomb lie my affections,
And with his spirit sadly I
survive,
To mock the expectation of
the world,
To frustrate prophecies and
to raze out 

Rotten opinion, who hath
writ me down 
After my seeming.
"The speaker is Prince Hal
who, in this pre-coronation
speech to his nobles and the
Lord Chief Justice, assures
them that he intends to assume
the serious role of King of
England and repudiates his former
role as the disreputable
underworld companion of Sir
John Falstaff."
Among others answering this
query were Liz Richter, Bennington,
Vt.; William Gifford,
Poughkeepsie, N. Y.; William R.
Bowden, Carlisle, Pa.; Jane
Trichtere, Providence, R. I.; and
Mary A. Strain, Bloomington,
Ind. 

Manners
MRS. MONTAGUE PRITCHARD,
Jackson, Mich., writes
that the phrase queried by
L. J. P. (Oct 18) is taken
from Edmund Burkes "Letters
on a Regicide Peace."  Here it
is in context: "Manners are of
more importance than laws.
Upon them in a great measure
the laws depend.  The law
touches us but here and there,
and now and then. Manners are
what vex or smooth, corrupt or
purify, exalt or debase, barbarize 
or refine us by a constant, 
steady uniform, insensible
operation, like that of the 
air we breathe in.  They give
their whole form and color to

our lives.  According to their
quality, they aid morals, they
support them, or they totally
destroy them."  George E.
Branch, New Rochelle, N. Y.,
also cited this source.
J. R. Cartwright, Ottawa,
Canada, cites the following
from Emerson's "Uncollected
Lectures: Public and Private
Education":  "Manners are
greater than laws; by their delicate
nature they fortify themselves
with an impassable wall
of defense."  And Cloyd D.
Looker, Montour Falls, N. Y.,
suggests this remark by the
Rev. Alexander Carlyle (1722-1805), 
a minister of Insveresk,
Scotland: "Manners are stronger
than laws."

What's
new
in the
kitchen?

Most of our popular Art Of
cookbooks cover great regional
cuisines; The Art of Cooking
with Spirits ($4.95) is different.
Here, Elise Landauer Meyer 
presents more than 400 superb,
spirited recipes, using no less
than forty kinds of wine, brandy,
liquor and liqueur.  This royal variety
(Crabmeat Lorenzo, Turkey
Flambe, Fruit Cake of the
Twelve Spirits) comes from many
cuisines, though Mrs. Meyer, a
good New Orleans cook, flavors
many prize recipes with a French-Creole
accent. But all are different,
delicious, and surprisingly
inexpensive.

Although The Art of Regional
Italian Cooking ($4.50) stays
inside the culinary borders of
one country, it is equally varied.
Maria Lo Pinto moves far beyond
pasta-and-pizza; she takes
you on a north-to-south cook's
tour of 435 Italian delights --
Antipasto t Zuppa Inglese; Cappelletti
alla Piemontese (the "tiny
hats" of the Po Valley) to Sicilian
Cannoli (cream rolls). Plus
advice on wine, bread, espresso
-- and even Dieting Italian Style.

"Soup to nuts" has always meant
a complete banquet -- but now,
in The Nut Cookbook ($4.50),
William I. Kaufman gives over
250 recipes in every menu category
for one of nature's most
nutritious foods.  Curried Pecan
appetizers .  .  .  Veal Amandine
.  .  .  Chicken Pine Nut Pilaff .  .  .
Brazil Nut Stuffing  .  .  .  Black
Walnut Pie .  .  .  Won't Fail Fudge,
and many more.  With holidays
coming, you'll enjoy these meal-brightening, 
energy-giving new
dishes. 

No holiday dinner is complete
without dessert; it's time to discover
Ann Seranne's The Complete
Book of Desserts ($4.95)
with its more than 500 international,
classic-and-casual recipes.
You get absolutely precise, step-by-step
directions for guaranteed
souffles; company treats like Croquembouche
and Baked Alaska;
family favorites like Shoofly Pie
and homemade ice-cream. Here
are perfect endings for all Successful
Thanksgiving Dinners .  .  . 
and Happy Cooking!
