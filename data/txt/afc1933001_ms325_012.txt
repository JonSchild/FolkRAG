of war, and crime ballads the tales of murders, the mixture makes exciting reading. The number of songs included will be astonishing to many who have assumed that New York is so thickly settled a State as to have no hill songs, sea chanties or surviving remnants of the old English and Scotch ballads like "Barbara Allen," "Lord Lovell" and "Two Sisters." City dwellers [?]nd the owners of country estates may be surprised a bit to read [?]ative song narratives including The Ballad of Grace Brown and Chester Gillette" and "The Murdered Wife, or The Case of Henry [?]. Green of Berlin, Rensselaer County, N. Y." The latter in[?]ludes among its stanzas such [?]leasantries as

[?]n inquest on her body her held
according to the law,
[?]nd soon it was proclaimed by
them that arsenic was the cause.
[?]reen was apprehended, lodged 
down in Troy jail,
[?]here to await his trial--the
 courts would not give bail.

Professor Thompson has solved [?] usually insoluble problem of [?]eing both scholarly and enter[?]ining at the same time. "Body, [?]oots and Britches" is by far [?]e most comprehensive survey [?] New York State folklore. It [?] well documented and the bibli[?]graphy for each chapter is ex[?]nsive. A tremendous amount [?] research has been intelligently [?]ccomplished and the results have [?]en sifted and edited with taste [?]nd feeling. The only error the [?]uthor makes is in not giving the [?]aders more of himself. He [?]ould not have let his years of [?]ademic scholarship lead him to the apology that ends his first chapter: "I have had trouble shifting my own style--that of a fat person feebly waving a pointer--to the livelier speed and narrative of the folk. If you don't like the opening of a chapter, skip three pages and see what happens." The first three pages of his chapters contain a deal of charming writing, writing that is important to the whole work because it reveals both the charm of the author's personality and his attitude toward the work he is doing. Many an objective and scholarly study of folk lore--in essence an entertaining subject--has proved dull reading indeed because the writer has chosen to present it without any intimation of himself or his adventures in collecting his material.

I called "Body, Boots and Britches" a homespun tapestry at the beginning of this review. Now I am thinking of it rather as a colossal hamper of good stories, good songs and good talk. Recent events have caused many Americans to begin taking stock of this country and its past. I can think of no happier way of acquiring a knowledge of the characteristically American temperament than through dipping into this big basket and devouring a few of its contents.
