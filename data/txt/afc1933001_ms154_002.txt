A  Division of Music

Attached is a suggestion from Mr. Lomax that the
Archive record the singing of Miss Mary Newcomb.  Instead
of 12 in. disks, it wll be more economical to use 16 in.
disks.  I recommend that these recordings be made, the
cost, $45-50 (25-16 in. disks and three sapphire cutting
needles) to be charged to Increase.
