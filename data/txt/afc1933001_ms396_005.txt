                 In the Nashville penitentiary Black Samson, a giant of a man with an engaging
smile, a singer of unusual quality, refused kindly but firmly to sing any of the songs
he learned as a railroad and levee worker.  "I've got religion, Boss, and I'se quit
all dat."  Later when we told the warden that Black Samson knew one song that we wanted 
especially, he sent a guard for him.  The fightened Negro shuffled up, took his place
before the microphone.  Alan, my son and collaboratot, started the recording machine.
"Shoot, Black Samson."  But Black Samson didn't sing.  He closed his eyes and prayed:

"Oh Lord, I knows I'se doin' wrong.
I cain't help myself.  I'se got to do what
Dis white man tells me.  I hope you will
understand and not blame me for what I has to do.
I knows it's sinful and wrong.  Amen."

Then he sang.  And the microphone captured both the prayer and the song.
Throughout the next day Black Samson asked me many times, after he heard his song played
back to him:  "Boss, do you like my song?  Boss, do you think that some of dose big men
up in Washington, when dey hears my song, won't do something to help dis po' nigger?
Sorta have mercy on him?"  As I shook hands with him late that night at the big
gates of the penitentiary, where he had helped carry our heavy machine, he said earnestly,
"Boss, cain't you help me git outa dis place?  I Jes' nacherly don't like it!"
                    Lightnin's eyes blazed as he sang.  Lightnin's free-world name was Washington, and
he claimed to be a nephew of Booker T. Washington.  He was nicknamed Lightnin', so a convict
told me, because he could think fast enough to get around the warden.  He was the leader
of quartet of black convicts brought from their cells to the vacant hospital room where
Lightnin' stood leaning forward towards the microphone, his three companions an a group
just behind him.  His color was a deep black, a "blue-black bad nigger", the warden  guard
whispered to me.  Lightnin' was still young, not yet thirty years of age, serving his second
term for burglary.  As his body swayed with the rhythm of the singing, his figure seemed a 
black Apollo in graceous beauty.
                Lightnin' was leading a song describing the days when convicts were released
by the State of Texas to owners of large cotton and cane plantations, sometimes to be
