BJ TAPE 2, p. 8

BJ: (Cont.) says, ah, says, ah, says, "People get made about that, Bessie," she
says, "But they oughts," say, "They oughta be glad that
they are one."
I still was mad at her right then and she didn't know it.
I said to myse'f, "Now, what you talkin' about!"
An' so, I would go on to readin', And I find it over there
where the Lawd said that would e. Said, "That slang name, on
earth," what, what we're Ethiopians, ya see? An' then we're,
we're one of the greates' people upon the face of the earth. If
we would jus', jus' understand it. See? An' we has ah, we's a
nation. Ya see. An' everything. Ya see, we jus' didn' know
it.
An' I was talkin' to my daughter-in-law about it. She,
she's pricked against it, ya know. An' I kept on talkin', an' 
so after she got saved an', an' that could go further away
with the Bible then, ya see, an' began to read an' ease up on it,
ease up on it. Ya gotta ease up on, ya know, ya can't feed a 
baby offa bones, ya know. Ya got to give him milk, ya know. 
An' so I jus' ease up on 'er, ease up on 'er until I got her to
see it. Jus' as happy with it now as she can be. She understand, see.
It's jus' a slang word. Jesus say, "That earthy name that they
call you." Ya see?
An', an' then it go along that way, ah, over there
where, it's in the, ah, in Act Apostle. Ah, I forget, I think
it's around the fifth chapter. But anyway, where you see there,
straight out nigger. See? First nigger
to convert; that's Enoch, (?) ya see.
All right, then then they, an' ah, Queen a Sheba [jus']
