SUBJECT:  Cooperation with Office of War Information August 3 through 8 

     The writer was one of several appointed by Mr. G. R. Parker, 
Regional Director, to cooperate with the Office of War Information
August 3 through 8 on a "study of rumors".  

     The entire period was spent in the towns of Huntington, 
Logan, Beckley and Bluefield, West Virginia.  During this period no 
rumors were heard.  I am unable to account for this.  The War was seldom
mentioned, and at no time did the discussion of the War get away from 
the current news topics of the day.
