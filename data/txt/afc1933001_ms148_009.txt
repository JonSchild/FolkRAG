The Archive of American Folk-Song has no funds for the publication 
of manuscripts no matter how worthy nor do we know of any publisher 
who might be especially interested in the collection of Serbo-Croatian 
narrative folk songs. Correspondent might find it easier to interest 
some University Press in this work.
