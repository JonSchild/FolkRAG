Tape: #893 Nimrod Workman
Nimrod: When Woodrow Wilson was president, I was working
in a place called old Rockton Mines, Mengo County, close to
Naugatuck. And we had to drive mules, and we shot coal
from a solid, used an old wire(?) puncher, didn't have no
machines then. Wore a cloth cap on my head and our lights
has a spout to them like a teakettle, had one of them cloth
caps and we put a wick in there, made out of cloth, come kind
of flannel, twisted in it tight down in there, and he's stick
out this here hole in that thing, that spout out here. And
we'd fill it full of oil, lead oil or lamp oil, and we'd burn
that, like a torch and make a smoke. I was working at the night shift
when they stacked arms. And my daddy was sick, I was
exempted from WWI on account of taking care of him, but I was
going to have to go in the next draft, if they was going to
take me. Well, no, they was going to take any of them, you
know, I don't care how old or parents sick. That last draft
was going to get me. I was looking forward, I'd go at any time.
And I had come out that night, I slept about an hour or two,
and I got this yoke ox, one of the spotted ones, white
with red spots on him, one with a white spot in his forehead,
I never will forget their names, Buck and Berry. I put that
old yoke on them and I was going around plowing, way up the head
of the ground, to put in some stuff. I'd plow a little and
than work in the mines. There was no one to help me and
Dad was sick, pretty bad off, and I was exempted. I heared the
plows a ringing, them old freight trains you know, that run them
