Cox: Oh, I don't know. He said that's how they catched the old
fellow. He see the smoke goin' out.
Lomax: But it worked the other way round sometimes. That is, some
of the farm boys would go up when. . .
Cox: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know. That's. . . .There was a bloke used to
be about there used to sing a song, about this. I never did learn
that one. 'Bout somebody goin' along with an old woman,  an old
farmer's wife. He got onto the bed or somethin' an' he - she was
taken ill durin' the night. That all came in the song. "Here's
an apple on        yonder tree, something from Amerikee came in,
then that, You must have it, love, says he, an' so I must says
she." That bloke - that come in, he had to go out, half the time
he was gone, he got out you know. He wasunder the bed, you see,
an' when this old farmer went to bed - the old woman turned up
in,                     reckoned she wanted this apple. An' the song went
along, the different parts, an' when they got to this apple
on yonder tree, this old fellow says, "You must have it, love,
says he, yes, an' so I must, says she." He went off to get
the apple, you see, for her, course - the time he was
gone was what the old woman had to get clear this other one.
Time the old farmer was gone - was gone after this apple he had
gone. That's - that's how the song kept goin' you know. That went
in all nice. Yeah.
Lomax: That's in old Boccaccio, isn't it, Peter? (pause)

Did you ever hear talk of the commander's name,
