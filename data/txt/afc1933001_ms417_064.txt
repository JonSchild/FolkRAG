I HATE THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM

I hate the capitalist system,
I'll tell you the reason why,
They caused me so much suffering
And my dearest friends to die.

Oh yes, I guess you wonder
What they have done to me
Well, I am going to tell you --
My husband had T.B.,

Brought on by hard work and low wages
And not enough to eat,
Going naked and hungry,
No shoes on his feet.

I guess you say he's lazy
And did not want to work;
But I must say you're crazy,
For work he did not shirk.

My husband was a coal-miner,
He worked and risked his life
To try to support three children,
Himself, his mother, and wife.

I had a blue-eyed baby,
The darling of my heart,
But from my little darling
Her mother had to part.

The rich and mighty capitalists,
They dress in jewels and silk;
But my darling, blue-eyed baby,
She starved to death for milk.

I had a darling mother,
For her I often cried,
But with these rotten conditions
My mother had to die.
