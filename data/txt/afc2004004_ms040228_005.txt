3                         On a Mountain
[*one girl*]
On a mountain stands a lady,
who she is I do not know. 
All she wears is gold and silver,
All she wants is a nice young man.
[*2nd girl joins - dance face to face*]
so call in my valerie dear,
valerie dear, valerie dear, so call in
my Valerie dear, while we go out
to tea.
