from Mississippi River overflow the approximately billion dollars worth of land and property behind the levee, land that no other section can duplicate in productivity without an annual expenditure of from $5.00 to $10.00 per acre for fertilizer. All this besides the advantage of peaceful living behind well kept and well guarded levees.
     Earthen embankments are, it is true, the most enduring structures  erected by man but "the everlasting hills" is a poetic figure that is only relatively literal, for the time will come when even the highest peak will be made level by the same natural agencies to which our levees are constantly exposed.
     It is of course probably true that if the levees, in their present excellent physical condition, were completely abandoned to the mercy of the elements for several years no catastrophe would result, but it is definitely true after five years of such treatment the cost of restoration from the condition of semi-wilderness to which they would then have reverted, to their present status would amount to more than twice five times the present annual cost for maintenance.
     The Board takes pride in its financial record also.
