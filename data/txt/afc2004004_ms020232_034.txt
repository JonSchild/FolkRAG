colored womens an' runnin' them colored womens an' all like that.
See, that's jus' five miles from there, an' they sit about 2
miles from us an' about 3 miles from Ray, you see?   But he come
up on this side this time.   Said the lil' [yellow] young girl over there
in a field with nobody but white folks over there, see.   An' so,
he come to the wrong one.   I mean Mama cussed that man to everything 
you could think of an'. . .
        Then Mr. Jennin's called Mr. Langford in.   Mr. Langford was,
had been there, but he was on the back out, out, out where they
[there were] was loadin' ah, cotton seed an' stuff.   Mr. Jennin's had
some of his boys, at leas', an' call Mr. Langford.   Mr. Langford's
a mad man. [(?)]   Mr. Langford tol' 'im, "Don't ever foot his
place in no way, no shape nor form.   Don't ever put his foot on
his place."
        'Cause Miss Daisy said, told 'im that she had seen 'im that
mornin' before there, too.   You know, down there. An' so, Miss, um
an' um, Miss Daisy said he had been ridin' through there an' almost 
stoppin', lookin' over that way.   But she hadn't, see, I 
hadn't seed that.   Ya see, I'd be home by myse'f until I git
ready to go up to the house.   An' I go [over] up to the house an' go
there an' play with the white children 'till Mama come home, come
from work.   You know, at that time. 
        So anyway, he didn' come back no mo'.   He sho' didn'.   An' 
not, not to my knowin'.   He was a full-grown man.   An' I mean an' 
he had pretty, coal black hair.  An' he had pretty, ah, you know,
black eyebrows an', man, he. . .An' rosy skin, jus' like Mr. Langford's. 
He just a man could go somewhere an' git him somebody.
You know what I'm talking' about?   He's, he could.  An' he did
that.   An' so we ain't had no more trouble with him.
