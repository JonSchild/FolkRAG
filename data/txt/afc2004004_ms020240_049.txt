that money.  An' don't nobody know who killed him.  Them Negroes
would eat him up, right on the corner where I stay from!  Don't
know who killed him.  Bricks an' everything was there.  'Cause
when he run out from around the tent with the gun? (CLAPS HER
HANDS)  They (mouthted?) him...An' don't know who killed 'im.
An' he was that word (?), so that's what we got the news
from his folks that knows about it, [that] this white man was to
give him s-so much money -- these white folks; not a man -- ah,
so much money to kill that princess, from Africa.
AL:  if they want to kill her?
BJ:  Well, I don't know.  I guess it's, you know, just teachin'
the colored folks too many things about they race, or what not.
Ah, I reckon; I cain't tell[; I don't know] all what.
But she was a princess from Africa.  Not only that, she was
worth the gold an' .  But she felt her death.  She
felt her death.  An' they killed her right there in Miami.  Right 
on the corner of 14th Street an' 5th Avenue, they killed him.  He
run out from there.  He's a-down on 5th Avenue like here, just...
my house sit, sit like here an' dis house was, was right down
there.  You know, lil' church house, lil' place they had meetings at
[there].  Because they had used to had lived there.  An' they turned
it into a church.  Took all the walls out an' turned it to a church
house.
An' then, right up on the corner, up there, just, just, this
same buildin' just run along, away, the 22 rooms [there] in it, an'
ah -- I mean apartment [place] things in it, you know, downstairs was jus'

corner, jus' as this boy run around this buildin' from here, run
around that way (MACHINE TURNED OFF.  THEN:)
