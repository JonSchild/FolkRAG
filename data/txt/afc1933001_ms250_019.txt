April 28. 1942

Dear Alan: I think that you will agree
that my check for $55.00 should end
all the pain and stop the flow of
debate in re the music charge. I wish 
to repeat:

1. That Miss Susan Prink told me
that Mrs. Seeger proposed to pay for
her extra corrections
2. That during one of our fierce
quarrels over the delay in the book
Mrs. Seeger said something [of] to the
same effect to me.
3. When the bill came in I wrote
a polite note (unbelievable, yet true) asking
if she was of the same mind, whereupon
I received the blast which I sent
on to you. That's the whole story from my end.

I believe I told you that Dobie
and Railroad and John Faulk and Frank
Goodwin are to spend Thursday night with
me, as I feel I will not be
able to go[?] on with them to Denton to
the Folklore meeting. Shirley has gone back to
Mobile, while Miss Terrill removes as Susan
wants the bed.  Father
