John A. Lomax, Esq.
University Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:
I am sending you with this a letter received yesterday 
from Professor Reed Smith, of South Carolina, together with a 
copy of my letter to him. This, as  you can see for yourself,
is rather an acknowledgement than a reply; advice as to plans
and methods will come, of course, from you.

  As you may already  have learned from other sources, Mr.
Engel has given up his place as Chief of the Division of Music,
but will continue for the present in an advisory capacity as 
Consultant in Musicology. His active duties and responsibilities
now devolve on me. Among these obligations that of furthering
your work as best as I can is perhaps the most agreeable
of all. I look forward to correspondence and conversation
with you and with Alan and take this opportunity of expressing 
to you both my keen interest in all that you are doing.

With regards from Mrs. Strunk
Cordially,

Chief, Division of Music
