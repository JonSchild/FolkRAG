Dear Alan - 
After I left you, or rather 
after you left me, I caught a 
ride with a used car dealer
from Greenville, South Carolina.
We left Washington about dark 
and drove steadily until Sat.
midnight, about 15 or so mi. per, hr.
I got pretty sleepy, but made it 
O.K.

Left Greenville Sunday, about 
4 o clock and got to Noshville
about midnight. Made it home 
the next day very easily.

I really enjoyed every minute
of the time I was there.
When you see Nick and his 
wife, give them my regards.

If you get the opportunity, I 
wish you would get the 
address of Miss Mackey Sloan
