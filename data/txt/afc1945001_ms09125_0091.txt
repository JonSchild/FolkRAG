Heard last year before the African
Invasion:
The tank corps are on the 
Arizona Desert going thru constant
drill after a ruff tour thru the hills
of the south.

One scout patrol surounded a man
in a small trench in Guaducanal the
commader said in a ruff tone
Who are you, a blinkin' Jap?
No answer
Who are you a blinkin Anzac?
No am an American
