"It's a shame that Government is allowing industry and big
business to make so much money.  Look at Higgins and Kaiser, for instance.
They'll be so rich when this is over they won't know what to do with
their money.  Maybe the Government figures it can borrow from them to
help pay the National debt."  (San Francisco -- August 5th - laborer)  [*3*]
