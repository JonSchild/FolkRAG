Tape: #224 Sacred Harp 

p. 3

tenor but my mother was an alto singer and my daddy wanted me to sing
what she did. So, I changed over...I'm gonna make some slaw now. 
(cooking, ...carrots in my cabbage, checking the chicken...)

AL: I guess there are ladies all around this part of the country getting
ready for,...the singing tomorrow.

MRS: We can't wait until the mornin'.

AL: How many of the ladies will be cooking for us tomorrow, I can't
wait to get there! Last Sacred Harp I went to I ate nearly all day!

MRS: Well, I'd say there'll be about 50 regulars and some extras I don't
know who they might be.

AL: And food enough to feed how many people, three or four hundred I guess.

MRS: Yes, that's right, there's always some left.

AL: And everybody brings out their favorite recipes.

MRS: Yes, ...favorite, or something that will keep or is easy to (?).
When you make salads you have to take it in an ice chest, if you
make fried chicken you can bring it in a regular lunch basket.

AL: Well the biggest things are pies and cakes, that's the kind of
specialty here. What pies and cakes are you gonna give us tomorrow?

MRS: Well, I've got fresh (French?) coconut pie and Peach pie

AL: Hmm, I can testify that French cooking, that is really fantastic!

MRS: I'm not gonna take 'em all tomorrow, I'm gonna save some for
Sunday. and I got a peanut butter cake I made earlier in the 
week and I froze it ... it's good!

AL: Energy to make those notes go higher, huh!?

MRS: Might have something to do with it.

(TECHNICAL)
I imagine you'll be around the food, and that's where I'll be too.
