Some rumors contain verifiable facts and cannot be denied
without revealing facts which must remain unpolished. [When a warship
is in an American harbor, for example, that fact cannot be published
without aiding the enemy -- even though the ship and its sailors are vis-
able to many people in the port area. Extravagant rumors -- about the
ship, crew, or cargo -- may spring up in such a situation. It is an un-
avoidable situation.] Projects can urge newspapers which print the in-
formation, after enough time has elapsed, to emphasize why the facts had
to be kept unpublished and why the rumors had to remain unchallenged.
Projects can impress their communities with the fact that something known
to hundreds of people is not necessarily known to thousands of people;
and that the repetition of rumors -- even those based upon a fact known to 
the rumor-teller -- make it easier for the enemy to find out what he may
not know, or may simple suspect.

While the major responsibility of a rumor control project is
to fill information gaps and to conduct an education campaign in crit-
ical thinking, it may sometimes become necessary to try direct counter-
action, that is, refuting rumors with specific information. This par-
ticular device in rumor control has many dangers, since it involves giv-
ing publicity to the rumor in an attempt to eliminate it. Unless the ru-
mor and its denial are skillfully presented, more harm is done than good.
Because direct counter-action is a new field, the experience of the
Office of War Information is here presented in the form of positive recom-
mentations.

1. Humor denial should only be done in print; never over the 
radio.
2. In general, deny only those rumors which can be denied
lately and conclusively.
