Once upon  a time there was a
military homing pigeon. And
as it was flying leisurely to
its destination with a report
from the front, it was jostled
by a second pigeon, which
bawled:

"Get a move on. I've got a
denial of the report."

The efficiency of the assembly
line is truly amazing. Even
the Army physical exams are
being speeded up. One doctor
looks in one ear, another looks
in the other. If they can see each
other, they reject the man.

Don't be jealous, Alfred! What
difference does it make if Milton's gun
makes a louder bang than yours
