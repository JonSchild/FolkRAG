Dear Alan:

I have undertaken to speak at the National Ass'n. of Negro Musicians convention here in August. I don't know exactly why, except that J. Wesley Jones is a nice guy and he asked me. They wanted [to] a subject so I picked one off their folio page headed "Purposes": "#4: to resist the desecration of Negro spirituals."

Now you can just take that smirk off your face, because I was reduced to a state of humility by your comments on the spirituals as my gang sang them. My defense for that still holds: we sing'm because we like to sing'm, even in our own pale-face way, and what other way should we know?

In other words, I should like to talk to the folks about something about which I'm thoroly uninformed. I might start out by blaming them for my lack of information, but that wouldn't take long to say, and what would I say next? Specifically I, uninformed tho I be, am annoyed intuitively by the elaborate "White" endings they stick on spirituals that are otherwise sung relatively simply.
