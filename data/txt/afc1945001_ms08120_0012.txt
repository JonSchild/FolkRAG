"Rumor"

Rumor's about the war aids
the Jap's. There are serveal
rumor's that I have heard
one is, Accidents aid the axis
so be careful. Hoarding ration
things also aid the axis.
There is a rumor that they
are going to ration meat and
butter and, clothes by the first
of next month. Ways we can
aid the Jap's is by not collecting
scrap, do not by war stamps
or bonds. BUy as much ration
things as you can. You and
I know of course that none
of these rumor's are true.
All American's can buy war
stamps and bond's and stop
the Jap's
