6) They werna long, they changed my tune, they sent me off to Spain, sir,
There's 40 regiments in a rack a-marching o'er the plains, sir.

7) Twa long years we fought with ain, but o, it was in vain, sir,
Until a ball gaed through my leg and I upped and fired again, sir.

8) When a doctor came to view my wounds he swore that I'd be lame, sir
But I                                    and I came limping home, sir.

9) Through all the hardships I came through it would hardly do to mention,
That I've come back to Forfar town to live upon my pension.

McPherson's Lament. JIMMY MCBEATH
1) Farewell ye dungeons dark and strong,
McPherson's time will no be long,
Below the gallows tree I'll hang.
Chorus:
So rantingly, go dantignly,
And so wantonly went he,
He played a tune and he danced aroun',
Below the gallows tree.

2) The Laird o' GRant the Highland sant
That first laid hands on me,
He plead the cause on Peter Brown
To let McPherson die. (Cho.)

3) Take off the bands from off my hands
And gae bring to me my sword,
For there's no a man in all Scotland
But I'll brave him at his word. (Cho.)

4) O what is death but parting breath,
Over mony's the bloody plain.
For in this place I've derived his face,
I'll scorn him yet again. (cho.)

5) The reprieve was cming o'er the brig o' Bannf
For to let McPherson free,
When they put the clock an quarter before,
And hanged him to the tree.

6) There's some come here to see my hung,
And some to buy my fiddle,
But before that I do part wi' her
I'll break her through the middle.
