Go get the third Johnny head and touch it North
Touch it North..
All right now boys lemme tell you bout Sis Joe this time...
Sis Joe on the M and O
Track heavy but she will go..
Take a mule take a jack
For to line this track back
On the mudline on the san 
On the mudline get a man...
Jack the Rabbitt on the Mand O
Track heavy but she will go...
Run down yonder to the fourth Johnny head and touch it wast
Make haste I hear the train a-comin(
All right now lemme tell you what I had for breakfast
Little rice , little bean
No meat to be seen
Hard work ain't easy
Dry bread ain't greasy

Now wait a minute you stop right there 
put your guns on your shoulders and come walkin' back
Get up there and touch that track just a fraction
What I mean just barely move it
Just barely, just somethin nother like a fraction now.
All right  I'm gonna tell you bout tampin' ties this tim e
Have to tamp em up solid
Have to tamp em up kinda slow
Jack the Rabbit , Jack the bear
Caincha move it just a hair
Sis Joe donchahear me now 
Sis Joe doncha hear me now

Now put yo guns on yo shoulders and come a walkin
Come a trottin, come a lopin
Come a-laughin  , come like you gonna get paid for it
Get a move on you
Git yo back breakin' holts young men
Yes.............
In the mornin' when I rise pick and shovel by my side

In the mornin' when I rise got a pain in my side

Hard work ain't easy,
Dry bread ain't greasy,

Sis Joe doncha hear me now,
Sis Joe doncha hear me now
