4 P.M., Sunday

Dear Father:
Just called Steve P.
who will be here all this week. 
Comon as soon as you 
can.  Unless something unforeseen
interferes, we plan to get off for 
Corpus late Thurs.., which would
give us time for a nice visit & return
on Sunday.  Does Shir. know we're
coming?  Wrote here sometime ago about M & I coming.
but got no response 
John
