said, "Well, ah, in the" what ya call "income tax."
   I said, "Well, I thank God to sen' it, 'cause it been a long
time since I been able to sen' it." Ya, see? An' so I jus' soon let
it go. I ain' gonna even ask for none of it back; I ain't even write.
Hum, hum!  Because it been so long since I been able to sen' it;
I been doin' piece work, ya know.  An' I didn' even sen' it...
Yeah... Um-hum, so tha's jus' good.
TL: Bessie, do you remember, a long time back in Dawson and Fitzgerald,
what the country was like back there?  How was the country;
was it rolling and  ROUND hills  ? What did it look like?
BJ: What?
TL: Down around in Dawson an' Georgia.
BJ: Dawson hilly? It's a hill country. Red clay...It was beautiful,
I'm tellin' you that.  It's a beautiful place...It's still a
beautiful place. I was up there not long ago; it's still pretty.
IT's pretty.
TL: What does the town look like?
BJ: Jus', jus' look real pretty. That's all I can say.  Got pretty
green trees an' -- Just like it is here or anywhere else, but it's
just a pretty place.  An' the, ah, there, you know, it just look
homeyfied wh-when I was there not so long ago. All but one thing:
The houses was built up better, ya know?  Co'se they ain't no ol'
slams; they ain't -- co'se they a few big houses there. But they
looks all right, too.  Got them fixed up, some of 'em. An' some
of 'em ain't.
TL: When you were real tiny, though, what was it like?
BJ: 's the same.
TL: Was it hilly?  And red clay?
