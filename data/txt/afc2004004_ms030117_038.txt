shall forgit.  It was Saturday evening.  A-n-n-d --
she ask-ed me to let huh have some money to pay
huh insurance.  One word growed into another.  She was
living wid my uncle -- roomin there.  And -- one word
growed into another, so I goed off an stead of handin
huh what she wanted I give huh FIFTEEN DOLLAR.  I give
huh fifteen dollars that evening.  Sumpin I was never
known to do, to give a woman all my money.  I went off
and cuss-ed m ysef out that evenin, wonderin how did I
do that?  (H e laughs)  Cussin mysef out, and went right
back and give huh five mo dollars.  Cuss-ed mysef out
again. Went off that Saturday night, come on back that
Sunday mawnin, give huh some mo money.  Two months when
I knowed anything I was down at the cotehouse married.
(Why do you think you were so susceptible to this woman?)
(He gives a soft shout of derision)  Oh Lawd!  That's what
I ast my own sef.I never have been able to answer
that question.  You know a question comes about sometimes
you ain't even able to answer.  (Did you find her
more attractive than other women?)  Wel-l-l.  A man that's 
blind don't ever know what's so attractive to him.
She was very nice and submissive in her speech.  Then too
she was nice in the way she treated a body.  Lot of people
you know, GOT to treat you nice to git where they wanna
git at.  You understand.  You can't go to the river, you
know, and throw in chunks if you wants fish out of there. 
You got to go quiet and calm.  You've got to go there
quite calmly.  Sometime you sit there on the bank all day
