Dear Sam: 

We have reports from small town newspapers to the
effect that a Professor Gustave Meyer, 1140 Bloomfield Street, 
Hoboken, New Jersey, is engaged in the distribution of gratuitous 
astrological information to newspapers. As you know,
newspapers often print astrological columns because of the
great reader interest in this stuff. 

The point about Professor Meyer is that his astrological
predictions prognosticate all kinds of difficulties
for the defense effort, such as sabotage, explosion or fire 
in the White House, threat to the life of the President, riots
and strikes.

The man may be harmless but, on the other hand, his 
communications casting doubt on the military effort of the
United States may have a purpose and we, therefore, consider
him worthy of investigation. Can you, through your access to
the FBI files, give us any information about this individual
for, if not, we would like to communicate with Mr. Hoover, suggesting 
an investigation.

We are enclosing a letter from Professor Meyer which 
was sent to us by the editor of the Stillwater Daily Gazette,
Stillwater, Minnesota.

Thanking you in advance for your cooperation,
 
Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
Office of War Information
