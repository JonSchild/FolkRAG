                                             *  *  *

The following rules for rumor control were released by the Office
of War Information on November 30, 1942 and may be used as the
basis for a continuing program.
           1. Never repeat a rumor.
           2. Never repeat a rumor verbally even to deny it.
           3. If you know the facts which can spike a rumor,
               cite the facts promptly.
           4. If you do not know the facts which can stop a
                rumor, ask the rumor-teller where he got his
                facts.
            5. Don't give a rumor a break.
