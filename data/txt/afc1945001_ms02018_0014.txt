      Quartermasters Corps.  (Man on the Street.  10/7/42)
3.  The Jews are handling all the junk and while we are giving what we
      have, they are making plenty of money.  (Government employe.  10/7/42)

      will be drafted.  Then they enlist in some branch where they can

5.  The Jews are pulling all kinds of strings to get easy jobs and
     commissions.  (Businessman.  10/7/42)
