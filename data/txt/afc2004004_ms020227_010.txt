BJ TAPE 12, p. 8

was 6 years old an' went to school the next year. [You see,] And so that
was good. Yeah...
You know, I didn', I didn' go down there for a long time. But
anyway I, I jus' made up my mind that it was all right.
An' I 'member when my daughter's in Miami. We was up on the
Lake. Okachobee. An' a big storm come. An' I couldn't get no
from her. I was sendin' -- She was ready to finish up
school in there, you know, that year I had to go up from the lake
for Cassius to git me a job? An' um, this woman -- I had a house
up on there, had a four-room flat. My, I bought a lot of stuff
there. When, when we got up on the Lake, we didn't -- we was
goin' back an' we wasn't gon' git the stuff an' whatnot. We jus'
bought mo' stuff, ya unnerstan'? In them ol' shanty houses? An'
this lady that was with me there... I mean I lef' with my stuff...
She didn' have nowhere to stay nohow, an' she was a darlin' woman, 
to chirren, an' so I jus' lef her to see about Rosalie the few 
mo' weeks, mont's, ya know, that she had to go to school.

An ah, I got so worried when that storm come an' I couldn't
git to her; she couldn't git ta me? An' when I wrote this letter,
she wrote me a letter that'll last me all my days! Ya see? So,
"Mama" said, "Don't worry, ya know, about..." Means, that way.
Said, an', "We, we got to part, some day. We got to live separated
from one another some day." Ya see? [He said that] So that made hi[m]t, hit, hit [made him want] really warmed me. You know? You got to -- 
don't have to be right on them all the time. Especially like that,
you know? Got to be able to part some day. That was, oh, sumpin' to say. 
So I said, "If I never have wanted to be apart from her. " Said
"I know..." 'Cause she didn't want to be apart from me, but she
showin' me, an' nothin' like she says, it's true. Ya see, ya see.
