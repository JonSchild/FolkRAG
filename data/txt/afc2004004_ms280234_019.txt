Tape 64. GERARD CAMPBELL:
The Bonny Irish Boy:
O once I was courted by a bonny Irish boy,
He called me his darling, his heart's delight and joy,
He talked to me often about getting wed,
But in a short time after my bonny boy he fled.

2) He packed up all his tools and to England took his flight,
So I packed up all me clothes and followed him one night.
But when I arrived in the fair English town
He told me he was wedded to a girl of high renown.

3) Farewell to the meadows where we used to walk,
Farewell to the meadows where we used to talk,
The wee birds are singing and the lark sings loud and high,
The song they all are singing is - "My bonny boy, goodbye."

4) So come all ye young fair maids, this warning take by me,
O never build your nest on the top of a high tree,
The leaves they all with wither and the roots will all decay
And the beauty of a bonny boy will soon fade away.

Green Bushes:
1) As I went walking one morning in May
To hear the birds whistle, see little lambs play,
I spied a young damsel, the fairest I've seen,
Down by the green bushes near bonny Woodgreen.

2) Says I, "Where are you going, my pretty young maid?"
"My lover I'm seeking, kind sir," she said.
"Could I be your lover and would you agree
To forsake the green bushes and follow with me?"

3) "I'll buy you fine beavers and a gay silken gown,
With furbelowed petticoats flounced to the ground,
If you'll leave your old love and follow with me,
Forsake the green bushes for ever," said he.

4) "O quick, let us be moving from under the trees,
O quick, let us be moving, kind sir, if you please.
For yonder my true love is coming, I see,
Down by the green bushes where he hopes to meet me."
