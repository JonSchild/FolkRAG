Tape 5: COLIN DAVIS.
The Sweet Primeroses:
1) As I walked out one midsummer's morning,
To view the fields, yes, and to take the air.
Down by the banks of the sweet primeroses
Where I beheld some most lovely fair.
2) It's three long steps I took up to her
Thinking to keep her by my side.
Which when I closer came to view her,
She appeared to me like some virtuous bride.
3) I said, "Fair maid, where are you going?
And what is the cause of all your grief?
I will make you as happy asany lady
If you will grant me one small relief."
4) "Stand off, stand off, you are deceitful,
You are a false and a deceitful man.
For it's you that have caused my poor heart to wander,
And as for relief, why, that's all in vain.
5) I'm going down to some lonesome valley
Where neither man nor mortal shall be find,
Where those pretty little small birds are changing their chorus,
And at everymoment blows blusterous wind.
6) Come all fair maids that go a-courting,
Take warning by what I'm going to say,
For young men all like a start on a summer's morning,
When daylight does appear, they fade away.

The Cruel Ship's Captain:
1) It's of a boy that was bound apprentice,
He was bound apprentice for ten long years,
He was bound out from St. Giles' workhouse
Because he was left fatherless.
2) One day this boy unto me offended,
But nothing unto him did I say,
I hauled him to a mizzen top
And there I kept him all that long day.
