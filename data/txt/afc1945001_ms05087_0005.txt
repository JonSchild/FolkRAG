"If we don't give the Russians some help now, we're going to have to 
take on the Nazis   alone.  It would seem a lot smarter to jump in
while we have some help rather than wait until we have to do the
whole job alone.  As soon as Germany cleans up on Russia, they will
turn all their power loose on England--and then we will have them in
our laps.  We'll have the Germans on the Atlantic  coast and the Japs
on the Pacific coast, and the going will be mighty rough alone.  I
can't see what we are waiting for."  Topeka, Kansas 8-4   (57)
