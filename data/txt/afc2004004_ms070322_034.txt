was angry with the director. And as 
[she is] always she was wapish in rehearsal,
flushing angry and saying bitter
things, very rebellious, sure I was imposing-
If anything I defer too much, become
too placid  and too protective,
forgetting my own difficulties.

Actually these days I have
found again the old anesthesia
that I had with Elizabeth -
inwardly preoccupied with sorrow,
deprivation, anger - outwardly
efficient, or at least busy with
the lifting and toting, driving 
the car, etc.  It would be very good for
me if I could [externalize my em] reverse
this situation - externalizing the emotion
& keeping steady inside.  In the end I
might find a balance. In the end
I will be dead.
