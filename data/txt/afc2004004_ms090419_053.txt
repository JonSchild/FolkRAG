Fisk, 9. 12.
Brother and the Pop on the R. C. line.
Casey Jones was a man, you know,
Who loves good times; he's always have [good] the dough.
All you [farmers should] firemen oughta be like me.
[I H]have a good-looking woman [that you call Jane Bee.] let your crow jane be.
Casey Jones was a might[y] good engineer.
Casey Jones was a man, you know.
Levee Camp Holler.
[Will Stark.] Will Storts
I've got something to tell you, before I go, [been]  I go.
Put on your blankets,
Put on your robes.
We're gonna have a [stand with the life in goes.] tune with the lightning bugs.
Oh, Lord, before I go.
[The home spring brackets] home string breaking and the [camp's] collar's cryin, the [camp's] collar's cryin.
The women in the levee camp hollerin'
"That man is mine;
Oh, Lord, th[is]e man is mine."
You can't do me
Like you done [Paul] Po' Shine--
Work him on the levee
Til he went s[t]one blind,
Til he went stone blind.
I heard a mighty racket,
But didn't see no trains.
It must have been my boss [man]
[Lugging] Gettin his money [chains] changed.
A: Wel, what else do you -- put on Bud Doggett.
S: All right.
Bud Doggett.
Will Stark.
Come[,] all you sorry bootleggers[,]
And listen to me.
I have a little example
I want you to see.
It's better to hit your maw
Or hit your paw
Than try to [run] use liquor
Under the new Jones Law.
Mr, Ferd, Mr. Chapman
arries too big a gun,
And he'll shoot any bootleggers
That breaks and run.
