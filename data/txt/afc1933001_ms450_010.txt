ON A FIELD OF BLUE CANE IN BAYNETOWN*

Mr. Yarbrough, well he had a field of de blue cane in
Baynetown
The devil took his backbone and cut it down

And any time when you wanna see de Mista Yarbrough laugh
Just take a great bi - a five dolla ---and give him half

And any time you wanna see Yarbrough die
Put your hands in his coffer and take a share

*Sung by a group of Andros Island
Sponge Fishermen on the docks of Nassau
July 1935
