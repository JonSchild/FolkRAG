Dear Father:

It's awfully hard to tell you just what to do about paying 
informants on your slender budget, but why not go back to our old
tack of not paying anybody anything because there ain't no money
to pay them with -- and then pay the ones that you have to, and 
we'll try to get the monty out of Harold. Be sure to get redeipts
for all of these items, though, so we won't have any 
trouble. I know your moans and groans are justified in the
past, but maybe this time we can do something about it.

I'll tell Jerry about the cutting needles. Thanks again
for the swell records you sent in, and please send Frank Goodwyn's
right along so that I can play them over and see whether I should
reply favorably to his suggestion about giving him a set of
duplicates. I have figured out a complicated scheme there, but
I need to hear the records in order to know what to do.

Love to you and Deanie,

Alan
