University Station,
Austin, Tex., 7/6/1934.

Dear Mr. Strunk:

As I wired you yesterday my report is on the way and will head towards your hands tomorrow or the day thereafter. I am trying to record from a wedding journey (automobile) of 7635 miles; settling down to work isn't so easy. Alan is in South Louisiana for the past six weeks collecting 'Cajun Stuff and [[?]] [[?]] Regards

Yours, John A. Lomax
