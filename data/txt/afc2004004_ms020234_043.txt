they wouldn't even fix the food.   Food was sit' in the dinin' room an'
meat done spoiled.   Just layin' in there.   Stuff to make soups.
An' [every] anything the man would want.   This other man, he's there
now, this -- his nephew -- [they ? ] livin' there now.
         An' I looked at this man.  An' I said, "You --" An' I talked with
'im an' ah, I said, "I didn' know [nothin' about you] nobody was in here
sick.
        He said, "My children don't have time to fool with me."  Says
"Some was..."   Sayd, "See, they, up on the table, they left that
sittin' right by the bed."    Was a old sardines in the can; been
opened don't know how long -- still in the can.   Just opened 'em an set
[hisself] 'em there.   Now, you don't know...Ol' hard bread, harder'n that
bread we have there.   And I'm tellin' you, that's just somethin'!
Bread all 'round there.   Done moulded, all 'round on the floor.

wet.   The mattress wet; the quilts are wet.  Gosh!  I -- Ow, I
couldn't wash another lick.   I went back in that house an' I
made up some soup.   You know, I had soup in cans.   I just mixed
it then put a lil' season to it?   An' I went on there an' I fed
'im an' I swept up there an' I tuk all that mess outa there.   An'
I  cleaned it up in there.   I didn', I, I didn' wash, I guess,
[for] in about two days 'cause I...An' up side the wall in there she
had plen'y a quilts there.   Where she, where she soak 'em.   She
would wash them quilts.   An' she would clean up for 'im.   She would
change 'im.   But not some days, an' sometimes it be 3 an' 4 days!
You know.   An' his, his bowels an' everything, have to move right
there.   He was sick.
