AL: A what?
BJ: Tottler. Ya see. An' that's in the Bible. An' so, an' I
was tellin' someone...
AL: What part of the Bible is that in, honey?
BJ: I'll find it in my big Bible there; it's right quick to find.
And I'm called a tottler. I'll show it to you before the day
out...Nothin'...Let me get the Bible there...A tottler, a person
that loves chirruns, ya know. An' ah, they those 
chirruns. An tha's a tottler. An' you look into it, that's it.
You's [It's] always -- you got to be a tottler in mind, tottler in work [wit],
tottler in doin', and' tottlin' along; you study goin'. An' even
when I'm layin' down, my mind's on it on what must I do about
it, how must I fix this or do that for the chirrun, to satisfy
'em, to keep the chirruns goin', to make 'em happy, and to get
somethin' out of 'em.
You get a lot out of chirruns, you know, an' ah, 'cause there's a 
lot in 'em, of you he'p get it out of 'em, like it in anybody
else. An' ah, may folk walkin' around today got a lot in them
if you could jus' -- somebody would take time to get it out of
em. As I, as I was prayin' talkin', said, "If you hadn'ta, 
look how, on the Island: We been singin' there now about 25 years,
ya see? And been -- I have, at least -- the others was longer.
And [tho'] them folks on'y get their dough -- all that pile of money that
other peoples give them to hear us sing -- an' give us a certain
lil' amount, three or four dollars, once a month. See, we count
it up, about three cents a, ah, a day, or somethin' like that,
a cent-an-a-half a day, a year. An' so! An' so, anyway, well,
this; all right, but we love to do it. We, we do it with a vim
