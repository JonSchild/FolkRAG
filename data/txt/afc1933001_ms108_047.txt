out of him in a great flood, and he has the 
immeasurable advantage of feeling himself 
persecuted.  The Czechs are quite bitter against 
the Sudeten Deutch and forbid German
songs, German uniforms and such.  He is 
quite ready to fill a martyrs grave, but 
he would certainly be a damn good man to 
have in the party.  He was very interesting - 
quite likeable, very intelligent with a simply
tremendous energy and driving force that 
never wasted itself; every move was meaningful
and [only] had a push that ordinary movements 
don't have.   He says there won't be a Czechoslovakia
by next year, and I quite believe him.
The Slovacks are moving for autonomy; the 
Poles and Roumanians are being infected 
with nationalism, and I don't see how things
can possibly hold together another year.
Write me soon.  I'll be in Strasbourg 
by the first of July, I hope.  I don't think I can 
possibly take Germany much longer.  We ought 
to be home September first.  Give my love 
to Ruth & Charlie & Jean & Nick.  And to you both 
all the love that's left - Bess   Please do write -
