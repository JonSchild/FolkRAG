Folk Culture Study, Coahoma County, Mississippi -- 2

Plantation, and the performance of teachers at the session for teachers
at the Coahoma County Training School.

Religious music was recorded at two sessions of the State
Baptist Convention and at the Holiness Church. One lack may be the 
failure to record a service of the A.M.E. Church in Clarksdale, but
this performance is so standardized that it might be duplicated in any
middle class congregation, white or colored, in almost any part of
the county. From special informants records were made of the performance
of religious songs which were dated and their current use determined.

Work songs were recorded where possible. A few field ballads
were recorded. It seemed impossible to secure an adequate performance
of levee camp songs, but from interviews ideas were gained of
the character of these songs. The outstanding performance of work 
songs was that of railroad section songs which came from a most cooperative
couple of section hands.

Secular music other than work songs was secured through the
performance of the county musician, the roaming professional musician,
a blind ballad maker, and an old musician who presented old tunes.
Interview material provided a history of the development of music in
the area and, as far as possible, a dating of these changes.

The last two days in the field were spent 60 miles from
Clarksdale "in the hills" where the people who settled Coahoma County
came from. There were found more musicians and a greater variety of
music than in the Delta, and which the report on the study will take
into account when written. A musical instrument called "quills" was 
found with which there is little familiarity outside the folk
