McBeth:  You took off your clothes.  There was blankets and
sheets and everything, but terrible stone floors and everything;
-- and no lighting and hardly any fire.  The farmers wouldn't
give them any firing or any coal.

Lomax: What kind of feeding did you have?

McBeth:  Terrible, O it was terrible brose.  Brose for breakfast,
brose for dinner, brose for tea.  Never a thought of ham and eggs
at time.

Lomax:  What is brose?

McBeth:  Brose is meal made with hot water, just about four or five
spoonfuls of meal put in a wooden cup and water put on the top
and salt and pepper, and stirred it up till it got thick - thick --
it swelled.  Then they put the milk on the top and sup that.  It's
called brose.  They made porage sometimes.  Sometimes they made 
porage for a change - but it was meal all the time -- made in
a different way.

Lomax:   What about meat and vegetables?

McBeth:  They didn't get meat.  They were supposed to get English
butchers meat one a Sunday - butchers meat was just a wee bit of
beef that you got on a Sunday - Sunday dinner.  And you got tea
on the table abut twice a week.  There was no tea in the morning
nor tea through the day.  Just tea twice a week.  But before that
time I've heard my father say it was tea once a week.  And way
back in my grandfather's time they only got tea once a six month.
That was about seventy or eighty years ago.  They got tea once a 
six month.  And then they brought tea once a week, and then twice,
- and now that they get tea all the time, and they get lunch at
ten o'clock, and a dinner, and a lunch at three o'clock.  They 
get tea all the time now.  They get tea fater their dinner now, see.
