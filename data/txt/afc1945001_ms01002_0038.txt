Rumors with a special group reference should not be used alone.
It will be found that there are rumors about Negroes evading the draft,
Jews evading the draft, defense workers evading the draft, management
evading the draft. To deal with these rumors individually is playing 
into Axis hands. As the Office of War Information has repeatedly pointed
out, the major theme of the Axis propaganda efforts is to divide us, to
set off one part of the community against another, to divide the United
Nations. If we take any of these rumors and consider a rumor about a single
group as a single problem, we are doing exactly what the Axis is trying to 
get us to do, that is, we are treating parts of the whole as if they were
separate wholes. It would be wiser to collect a number of these similar
rumors and present them all together with the sort of counteraction that
would point out that nobody is evading the draft, and perhaps more important,
that we cannot, with any validity, talk about these parts of the community
as if they were really separate sections. The draft is a national draft. It
is administered throughout the nation on a uniform basis. We don't have one
draft for management, and another draft for labor, and another draft for each
of the minority groups designed on the basis of religion or race, or national
origin, or supposedly linguistic background, or Axis mythology. To talk in
such terms is serving Hitler.
While for the general educational programs and special campaigns
which may be devised by the educational director and his advisory council,
all media of communication should be used, for the direct counteraction sections
the radio should be avoided. Any device which makes it possible for people to
lose the continuity of the total unit should be eschewed. Any device which
makes it possible for people to.
