Dear Alan:

I appreciate the suggestions made in your letter of December 22.

As you know, the Union now requires that all musicians must be members
of some chapter of the national Union, otherwise, we can not record
them. The result is that our Hillbilly recordings have been very
much reduced. I doubt that at the Union rate we could afford to
make a series of new square dance recordings and come out with a
whole skin on them. however, I will take your suggestion up and
if anything can be done, we will try to arrange it on the occasion
of the next expedition into the South.

The Order Department promised me that the available records would
be shipped to you yesterday. I hope they have lived up to their
promise.

What is your answer to the proposition I made to you in my recent
letter?

I hope that you have had a very pleasant vacation. Please send
my best regards to your father when you write to him.

Sincerely yours,
R. P. Wetherald
