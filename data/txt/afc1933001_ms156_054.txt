Washington  D.C.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Enclosed you will  find the letter which I told you
I would write to the Broadcasting Studio in New York.

I was very much disappointed , and so were the
guests at our informal dinner- that you were unable to be
with us at the recent conference held in Washington.
However, we did enjoy Mr. Seegar - he was splendid.
I hope that you had no serious complications with the
threatened mastoid and  that you are feeling tip-top
by now. Mr. Charles Seegar gave a very interesting
talk to the afternoon meeting, and I would like to  thank
you for providing him to take your place .

I should like very much talk over with you
sometime when we both have a bit of time- educational
values of the splendid type of thing you are doing.

Sincerely yours,

Ruth K. Webb
Administrative Principal
