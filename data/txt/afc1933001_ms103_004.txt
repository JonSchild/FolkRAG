Dear Mrs. Lomax:

     Before sending you the permission forms to
sign, we should have written you that the Library of
Congress is planning to issue during the [p]latter part 
of this year several new long-playing records in its
series of folk music records. We are now selecting
the material which we would like to include and among
the songs we have chosen the version of "Buffalo Skinners"
sung by Mr. John Lomax.

     As you know, our use of the song does not,
of course, prohibit the [i]the use of the same song in any other
way you see fit.

     These songs are issued by the Library of
Congress primarily for scholarly and university use. It
is our hope that you will grant us permissi[ng]on by signing
and returning the forms as soon as possible and thereby
help in the preservation and use of America's traditional 
folk music.

     With best wishes,
          Sincerely yours,

Duncan Emrich
Chief, Folklore Section
