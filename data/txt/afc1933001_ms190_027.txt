Mr. Willis Lawrence James
Spelman College
Atlanta, Georgia

Dear Mr. James:

     Enclosed is a set of application blanks which
should be filled out and mailed to Rosenwald by air mail
immediately, as time is very short. I am also enclosing
an excerpt of Mr. Lomax's letter to Mr. Haygood, Director
for Fellowships, of Rosenwald, for you interest.

     Mr. Lomax is in the hospital for a few days.
He sends you his regards and hopes that things will work 
out well.

     With best wishes, I am,

     Sincerely yours,

     Secretary to Alan Lomax
     Division of Education Services
