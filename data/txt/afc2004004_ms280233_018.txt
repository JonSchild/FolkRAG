Lomax: Where did you learn that?
Cronin: I learnt that at the very same school.
Lomax: Do you think that's an Irish song?
Cronin: O certainly it is.
Lomax: Did you know the people about whom it happened?
Cronin: No, I didn't. But it was somewhere in Ireland it
happened. Capacuinn. . . . and I believe it, according to the song.
She followed him, and when she came to the door it was his
mother that answered it. She didn't want him to know; didn't
want her son to know. She didn't want her to know that he was
inside - so she came to the window and it was she that was
answering all the time. And it was like a dream to him. He woke
up and thought he heard her voice and said to his mother, "Is she
there." And she said, it was she and she is drowned.
Mrs. Cronin then repeas the last stanza.
Then COW'S SONG in Gaelic.
Then OLD MAN'S LULLABYE in Gaelic.
The Charming Sweet Girl that I Love.
1) I've tramped the anguished mile over yon moor most sadly for five or six years,
For in secret I sigh, lamenting the one, most compassionately wasting my tears.
For it's all for the sake of a charming dame, who in my bosom hath enkindled a flame,
I could not make her known to you by any other name
Than the charming sweet girl that I love.
2) Last May I saw my darling in the morning very early,
In the sweet little town of McCroon.
She took me by the hand and treated me most kindly,
And made my company her own.
By her carresses; by approaching doom,
She said if she'd survive until next month, which was June,
She would pay me a visit -
Which was forgotten very soon
By the darling sweet girl that I love.
3) And why should not I love her because she is charming and perfect in ever degree,
And why should not I love her because she is charming and marvellous pleasing to me?
I love her in my heart and I love her in my soul,
There's no human being onn earth that could my love for her control,
I could not find to please my mind, I mean from pole to pole,
But the charming sweet girl that I love
