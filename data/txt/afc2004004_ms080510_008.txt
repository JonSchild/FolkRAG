                                       [*1*]         instrument of the frontiersman] but
                                                       the fiddle only came into general
                                                       use in Europe in the 16th, in the
                                                       1600s and it became the dominant
                                                        instrument of Great Britain in the
                                                        17th century so it was really late
                                                        even there, that was the time of the
                                                         migration, [but] a lot of the people
                                                         who came from Britian didn't have a
                                         [*2*]         fiddle and [it was slow [and] in becoming
                                                         common in the real frountier because
                                                         the pioneers couldn't make fiddles.
                                                         They could make mouth bows and
                                                          banjos when they learnt that from
                (2)                                      the blacks, but they couldn't make
                                                          fiddles so they will remember with
                                                          absolute ecstatic delight the first
                                                           time they ever heard a fiddle sound.]

                                                           It is well summed up in the verse
                                                           about when, lets see . . .

[*01 . 08 : 31.24*]                                  Sindy hear the fiddle,
                                                           She had heard it once before,
                                                          But when she heard my . . . oh Christ.

                                                          Oh . . he took her by her lilly white
                                                           hand  and . . .

                                                          He took her by her lilly white hand,
                                                          And light her like a pigeon.
