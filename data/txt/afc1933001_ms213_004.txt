Houston, Texas,
3/11/1939.

Dear Alan:

I don't like to think of you 
living with no communication between 
you and John and Shirley. Anyhow 
I hope you can find time 
to read Shirley's last letter to me. 
You might then forward it on 
to Johnny.

The machine is giving me 
fits, to wit

1. One Tube broken in shipment

2. Two burned out.

3. Two too weak for good recording.

4. When the machine gets [and] 
hot (that seems the reason) the turntable 
slows down and spoils
