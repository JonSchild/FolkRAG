Rev. Davis:  I could tell you how they got em too.  An I don't want you to
push me n either cause I don't wanna --
Eliz:  Rev. D, how do they get their churches?
Rev. D:  I hate to tell yo u.
Eliz:  Why?
Rev. D:  Cause.  It's right on the tip of my tongue to tell you but -- you want
me to tell ye?  Cause of the weakness of the minds of men fallin -- for
women.  Puttin women in their places.  Thass how they fust come to be ordained
an licensed.  By we weak-minded men.  Man that got  a strong min knows that
God put him there to be head ain't g on do that.  I don't care who h e is.
You take a-woman.  She's the strongest thing on earth in one way.  She's so
strong until she cause Sampson to lose his life.
Mrs. D:  We understand that part.
Rev. D:  For certain things that he needed out of her caused him to fall.
Johnny:  That's the power they have.  Thass the power they've got today.
Now Rev. D says that it's not right for them to use that power.  It's the 
wrong kind of thing to use as power to get themselves pulpits.
Rev. D:  Wrongest thing man ever fell for in his life.  It's causing many
people right this very day to pitch some hell right this minute.
Eliz:  I think it's true that if th at's how they got there then that is
wrong.  But perhaps many are there because they have a genuine message.
Mrs. D:  Yes.  That's right.
Eliz:  I should think the more ministers the better.
Mrs. D:  My sister is a g ood speaker.
Rev. D:  I'd tell huh if she was heah.  I don't care i f yo ur mother was a 
preacher.  I don't care if my mother was a preacher.
Mrs. D:  You know she's good.
Rev D:  I listen at em.  Yo u understand, Mistah Johnny.  I listen at em.
Johnny:  You jes know that the Lord didn't call em --
Rev. D:  I jes know it.  Ain't no use me arguin bout it.  I jes know it.
