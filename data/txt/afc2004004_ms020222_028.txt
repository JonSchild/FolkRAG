[*WHITES LEARNING HEALING FROM NEGROES*]

you know, to, to live. . .An' I don't know ah. . .Understand, hit,
musta had been. . .it, had. . .it was in them, they knew these things.
Some of 'em knew these things, had knew before they left.
I mean, jus' handed down in their minds, or what.  Because
every one, you know, knows something to do for themselves more

BJ:  Yeah.  Know what a leprachaun is?  Hum!
TL:  No, what does it mean?

TL:  Is that what it means?

they they know that, then, then they take all the scales [that] ah, some, ah...

be great doctors.  You know, from it, an' then turn around
charge the leprachauns -- I mean the ah, the Ethiopians so hard
and so much for it.  But it comes direct from them, ya see?
That what -- You, you know.  The understandin' of it.  Soon's 
they ketch it, they, well, you know, they tol' everything, most
