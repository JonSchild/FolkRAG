A
Saturday night in a dress shop on 
Roosevelt Road. (It was very crowded.)
One lady bought a dress which costs
$20.00 she wen to the clerk and said,
"Gee, are the dresses expensive now I remember
paying $10.00 for the same dress which you pay
$20.00 today." The clerk said, "Lady, did you
hear of clothes rationing." The lady
said, "No, I better get 5 more and leave
a deposit on them." (the fine dresses
all cost $20.00 and up each.)
