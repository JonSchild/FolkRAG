C. American Negro Folk Music

In contrast to the Haitian and Bahaman Negro, the American Negro was
absorbed. Musically speaking, at least, the solute had more to do with the
resulting solution than the solvent.

1) It is common knowledge, even though savants dispute endlessly about just
what happened, that Negroes made over white religious music entirely. The
spirituals were the result of this recreation and are more familiar to most Americans
than The Star Spangled Banner. "The New Buryin' Ground," sung here by a
group of Negro convicts in the Virginia State Penitentiary, is a spiritual turned
work-song. The "lift" of the leader's voice is noteworthy.

NEW BURYIN' GROUND

O come on, come on let's go to buryin',
O come on, come on let's go to buryin',
O come on, come on let's go to buryin',
Way over on the new buryin' ground.

The hammer keep ringin' on somebodys coffin,
The hammer keep ringin' on somebodys coffin,
The hammer keep ringin' on somebodys coffin,
Way over on the new buryin' ground.

That must-a been Laz'us that the people was buryin',
That must-a been Laz'us that the people was buryin',
That must-a been Laz'us that the people was buryin',
Way over on the new buryin' ground.

O come on, come on let's go to buryin',
O come on, come on let's go to buryin',
O come on, come on let's go to buryin',
Way over on the new buryin' ground.

That must-a been my captain that the people was buryin',
That must-a been my captain that the people was buryin',
That must-a been my captain that the people was buryin',
Way over on the buryin' ground.

(This song was first printed in Lawrence Gellert's Negro Songs of Protest)

2) Before Negroes had got their fingers tangled in the base strings of pianos,
and guitars, they used their knees, feet, mouths, mule whips, axes, etc., to
provide accompaniment for their songs.

a) "Dat's All Right, Honey" is the type of patting song to which the
slaves used dance before minstrel shows were thought of.

DAT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY

I got a horse, oh, baby;
Buggy too, oh, Lawdy;
An' de horse's black, baby;
An' de buggy's blue. Sho nuff?

Way up wonde', darlin', 
'Bove de sun, Lawdy,
Girls all call me, baby,
"Sugerplum." Sho nuff?

Refrain: It's all right, darlin';
Dat's all right, baby.

Dat's all right, baby;
Dat's all right, honey.
