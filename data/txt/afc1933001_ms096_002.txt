Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your first shipment of records was 
received here (a box of 26) the week before
last,. Of course we have not yet had time
to receive the second group.

I have been waiting for an opportunity
to examine these records for breakage.  Unfortunately,
three of themarrived cracked,
although not, so badly that they
cannot be copied.  Johnny Langenegger has
made out the enclosed list of points to 
remember in packing records.  It seems that
if any one of them is not observed to the
letter, breakage in inevitable.  We have 
had this kind of trouble in nearly every
shipment recently received from collectors,
and it is painful to think what a loss
of time and creative work is represented
by those almost invisible lines of breakage
in the the glass.

I shall notify you as soon as we
receive your second shipment.

Sincerely yours,
