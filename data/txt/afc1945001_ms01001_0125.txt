           A rumor-control group can perform a significant service
by making people aware that in spreading hate rumors they are playing
into the hands of the enemy's strategy of "Divide and Conquer";
those people who repeat rumors about any racial, religious, or
social group in this country--whether they mean it or not, whether
they know it or not--are playing into the enemy's hands.

           Hate rumors present a continuing danger to democracy's
war effort.  One necessary answer to hate rumors lies in widespread
community campaigns designed to attack the sources of hate, to
expose the prejudices which lead to hate rumors, to blanket hate
rumors with energetic information and educational programs, and to
make Americans aware that the enemy energetically inspires hate rumors
in an effort to get us fighting among ourselves.

The Community Rumor-Control Project
           News is ordinarily thought of as a report of day-to-day happenings.
In the course of such a process, interest often runs ahead of
the facts available, and rumors fill in the places where information
is incomplete.  A story of rumors will reveal where the needs for more
information lies, and the rumor-control group can perform a valuable
function by undertaking to improve the information facilities of the
community in satisfying the special information needs which rumors reveal.

           The rumor-control group can be of greatest service if it regards
itself primarily as an added information agency in the community, helping
the other information agencies, and taking responsibility for detecting
and meeting gaps in information by the analysis of rumors.  The rumor-
control project can profit greatly from the cooperation of local newspapers, 
radio stations, civic groups, librarians, welfare agencies, and other
