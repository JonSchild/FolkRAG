From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, New Jersey
Heard in Montclair, New Jersey, August 10, 1942
Subject: AXIS PROPAPANGA

"A number of my friends and I [see] feel that the New York Times
unwittingly swallowed Axis propaganda when it printed that article [*3-*]
on Sunday, August 9th, about the British house wives and the entertainment
of American soldiers. When the article said that the house wives did not
want the canned goods which American soldiers were encouraged officially
to bring to parties--can't you imagine what a variety of destructive
thoughts that stirs up in Americans, for example: that the British
are not in need of food rationing; that the British scorn anything [*2*]
American; or that the British are really trying to get out of entertaining
Americans about whom they are not at all keen really."
