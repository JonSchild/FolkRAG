[*(SECRETS OF QUICK PICKING)*]

aaah, Law', I forgit his name, but anyway these -- Gerry?  I
can't remember that man's name -- but anyway, these 2 guys was
really rough on beans.  One of 'em was real tall.  An' one of
'em was very little.  But them mens, they could pick beans, ya
hear?  An' ah, this man helt a watch on 'im.  An', ah, an'
that boy picked, ah, ah, rum, he picked 10 hampers a beans, ah,
every 10 minutes. . .Every 10 minutes.  He know the stuff, though.
TL:    How big is a hamper?
BJ:    Hamper holds 60 pounds.
TL:    60 pounds!
BJ:    60 pounds is a hamper!  You can jus' bet yo' life. . .
TL:    What's the secret?
BJ:    [ah, ha,] Ah, ha, ha, well, one secret is, he knew how to
put his beans in, in the hamper to keep ['em] them from packin' 'em too
much, see?  Ya see?  An' that was it.  An' then, ah' ah, an'
then, an' the next thing about it, he could jus' pick the
natchul beans an', you know, the beans, an' not try ta, you know,
put leaves an' all kinda stuff in it.  He picked them beans!
An' he know where they -- An' next thing about it, he know how to
[stretch] strike his han' to that vine to get them beans good.  Me, I
got to turn the vine over an' pick down in there to git 'em.  Well, see,
that's where I, I'm left behind.  But he done learnt how ta s --
throw that vine an' not tear it up -- 'cause you not supposed to
tear up the vines, ya know, so they can bear the next time, an'
the next time.  An' 'cause they really behind ya lookin' that to see
ya not scramblin' an' muddlin' up the vines, 'cause they won't be
no good for another time.   An' also don't pick too [yellow] young a beans
because they cain't be sold; they cain't be eat, you know, like
that?  But they can go for the next time, an' make beans.  So that's all
that's in learnin' how.
