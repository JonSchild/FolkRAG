Memorandum              
TO:  [Chief Assistant Librarian]
Librarian
FROM: Roy P. Basler RPB
Director, Reference Department
SUBJECT: Charges for making tapes of Library of Congress Archive of
Recordings which are to be used by commercial recording
companies in issuing records
   The attached file is being forwarded again
for your review, with a request for your reconsideration
of the instruction as to what charge should be
made.
   Mr. Rogers' note dated 9-12-58 on Dr. Spivack's
memorandum of June 13, 1958, is:  "Charge of $100 per
side approved for commercial use and general publication."
Dr. Spivacke finds that this is not readily enforceable,
because we will not know at the time tapes are procured
by commercial companies, how many records or sides will
be issued.  The time element on any one side of a 
12-inch LP commercial record may vary from 20 minutes
to 35 minutes.  Furthermore, a request for a tape running
one hour may provide less than a half hour of the
particular poems or folk songs which the company wishes
to use, and we cannot economically excerpt from the
original tape only those portions wanted by the company.
   My original recommendation written on page 2
of Dr. Spivacke's memorandum of June 13, 1958, was that
 "the Laboratory be authorized to collect a straight fee 
of $150 per hour's recording time (or a proportional
charge for less than one hour) in addition to the regular
charges for making tape, when the request comes from
a commercial recording company for the purpose of issuing
a commercial record."  Dr. Spivacke agrees that this is
still the most practical charge to apply, since it is 
applied to the actual recording time in the Laboratory
and not to the final product, over which we have no
control, and which the company itself may be unable to
specify at the time the request is made (i.e., the company
does not always know whether it will use part or
