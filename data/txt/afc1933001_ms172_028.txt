Notes on Recording Equipment

     Here are some notes in answer to Laura Boulton's letter. We are using
Presto equipment at this time although we have examined Fairchild, Allied,
Universal, Federal, Soundscriber and many others. We use Presto machines
primarily because of their light weight. Neither Allied nor Fairchild makes
small machines. In fact, the Fairchild machine and the Allied machine weigh
more than the Presto Model Y, which we also use in the field. In addition,
the controls and the mechanical features of the Presto are somewhat simpler
than either the Fairchild or the Allied. In addition the cutting mechinism
of the Fairchild machine is somewhat difficult to operate, [however], We are not
at all satisfied with our Presto machines. Certain parts are lightly constructed
and no provision has been made to pull them firmly in place during transportation,
they may easily become broken. We are at this time working on plans for a new
recording machine. However, it is impossible to predict when it should be ready,
for use.
     We have just equipped a sound truck with a duel tone table Presto 6-N recording 
machine, a 32 volt battery system, a 350 weight convertor, facilities for charging
the batteries, a 4 microphone portable control board and a telephone system
communication between the truck and the microphone locations. The operation of
the truck is large enough to supply power for photo-floyd photography.
