Mrs. John Hough, Sr.
Brandon, Vermont

Dear Mrs. Hough:

A friend of yours, Mrs. Noyes, has told me
that you know a number of old ballads sung in Vermont
when you were a girl. The Library of Congress, in
collaboration with Mrs. Flanders of Springfield, Vermont, 
is making a collection of New England ballads for the
Archive of American Folk Song. Mrs. Noyes mentioned
particularly Fair Ellen or The Black Bride. I would
deeply appreciate it if you would write out the words
of all the songs you know and send them to me. I 
look forward to hearing from. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
