Memphis ?
The first time I went to Memphis was around 1908.  I went with 
a fellow from Jackson, Mississippi.  He was a little bit of a guy but i t 
seems like he had stole his name from another big tough guy. Called himself 
Jack the Bear,  ( I believe).  The boys would often use alias names like 
this so they would be known as somebody.
Jack the Bear says, "Let's go to Memphis," and it was jake with me;
but when he wanted to hobo, I told him that I didn't care for it.  I told 
him how I had ruined a sixty-dollar suit of clothes coming into Pascagoula, 
because I thought the train was slowing down and jumped off the wrong time.
"Okay," Jack says," I'll tell you what we'll do.  You play piano 
very well.   We'll use our money to get us as far as we can and when we're 
flat you can play and get us something to eat and enough money to get to the 
next town."
Now I thought Jack knew all about Memphis.  I wanted him to go along 
to introduce me to the different personnels there and he made me think that 
he was really a Memphis man trying to get back home.  So I said, "Sure," 
I can play up some food and a place to sleep.  There ain't no argument about 
that."
The first town we hit was Yazoo, Miss., one of those little bit of 
towns with a river running right through it--- maybe a pond.  The Yellow 
Rightaway, I made the landlady of a house there, so Jack and I had plenty 
to eat, but one of the local boysaround there, one of those trouble makers, 
began to say things, so I told Jack we'd better pull out.  Somehow or 
other we got to Clarksdale.
