Dear Mr. James:

   In answer to your letter of October 2, allow me
to say that I am very pleased with your interest in
the notion of a collaborative folk-song collecting project.
I have not answered your letter sooner because
I have recently shifted my work to the Office of War
Information.
   In the next few days I hope to prepare the outline 
of the Southern Collecting Project for the Rosenwald
Foundation. In this connection I need from you a brief 
statement of your academic training and a description of
the work you have already done in the field of folk music.
   The next question is the projected year's work. Do 
you have a car of your own, or is one available to you.
Are you interested in covering a region in your collecting
work or would you prefer to make an intensive study of a 
small area. Either one of these notions would fit in very 
well with the whole plan, which envisages three or four Negro
collectors scattered through the south from Louisiana
to the East Coast. One of these persons is extremely competent
in the Negro Creole dialect and will work in southern
Louisiana. Another of the fellows will carry out an intensive 
study of a small community somewhere in the Delta region.
My hope is that if you plan to attempt a broad coverage 
you would choose Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, 
or any part of this region. It happens that the  Library
has very few records from that area, whereas more
material has been recorded further west. Since I am considering
the applicant just mentioned, along with you,
I should like to know definitely what you are interested 
in doing. Please write me in these various regards as
soon as possible.

Sincerely yours,
