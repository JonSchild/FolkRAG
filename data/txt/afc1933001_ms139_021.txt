Laurium, Mich
Nov. 23- 1938

Dearest Alan:-

Thought, I'd drop you
a few lines again seen that
you didn't answer, are you so
busy or are you forgetting us with
all your happiness out there, Also,
Yalmer and the whole family
is lonesome for you, you were
so much fun. We have a full
winter out here, now, Yalmer's
playing the mouth organ and
Abo, is lisening and - I'm writing
this letter for you. Yalmer's
health has lost control, But
nothing can't be done, I bet
work, keeps us off your mind
But, Please, Alan don't forget
us cause we want to see
