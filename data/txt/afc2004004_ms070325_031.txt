missed the boat.  The chief of customs
appeared on a moto.  An unshaven youth
of 23 I'd say.  His britches were so patched
in the groin that he looked like a beggar
We sat & talked the thing out under
a picture of El Caudillo while B & Br
took their pleasure in the open outdoors.
I wished I had never come.
   It cost me only $80 to get the
machines in.  Now I'm here I never
want to leave.  We fell into the arms of
the people last night.  There was a 
Sardana last night in the outdoor
cafe on the bay & the sound of the 4 oboes,
flutes & trumpets washed the sleep right
out of my head.  While the yg folks
danced in circle, with a lovely hopping
syncopated step, we recorded the
hot music of the dance. Really it was
all bullfight stuff -- rhapsodic in feeling
but it made these Catalonians bounded 
on the tips of their toes.
   Br. went home to bed in disgust. Bernard 
quiet strange myopic helped with perfect
tact & intelligence.  I fell in the love the country.
