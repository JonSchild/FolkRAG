good member and supporter of his
political party and at the same time
be a good member and supporter of
the Farmers Union. But he should
not try to mix the two.

Each one of us is entitled to his
own political opinions. We may differ
on political matters but we can
be one in the Farmers Union. In
order to prevent dissension within
the ranks of the organization we
should live up to the national bylaws
should not degenerate into political
rallies.

If we bear these things in mind we
can come through this election year
a bigger, stronger, and better organization.

Fight! Fight! Fight!

(Tune: "On Wisconsin")

Farmers Union, Farmers Union
Hear the call to arms,
Step into the ranks for justice
For the man who farms.
Hear the bugle! Hear the bugle!
Rise with all your might,
Fight Farmer-Union Soldier,
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Farmers Union, Farmers Union
Raise your battle cry,
Break that line of opposition 
Every foe defy.
Stop that gambler, speculator-
One-Line parasite,
Fight Farmer-Union Soldier, 
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Farmers Union, Farmers Union
Drive ahead with speed, 
Dogs will growl and humans bark
To try your way impede.
Turn your light on,
Keep the bright on,
Give her gas on high;
Fight, Farmer-Union Soldier,
Ne'er say die.

Farmers Union, Farmers Union
U.S. is awake,
Drive ahead cooperation
Make the old-line shake.
Cling together, cling together
Break the old-line gang
Fire Farmer-Union Soldier
Bang! Bang! BANG!

FOUR MINUTE SPEECH

By FRANCES W. BUTTS
Opportunities of Spare Time
1. Leisure spells opportunity.
a. Our vocations are not often of
our own choosing but become
ours through necessity, chance,
heredity or environment, but
outside of the time spent in
actual labor ours lives are our 
own.
b. Labor-saving machinery has 
given us increasing amounts
of free time. Intelligent persons
make the most of this 
opportunity for cultural advancement.

2. History of Recreational Instinct
It is a known fact that the play
instinct in various forms has existed
as far back as history takes 
us. Primitive attempts at handicraft
and drawing have been frequently
unearthed. The old Roman
arenas, the bull fights of
Spain, are but examples of the
recreational urge wrongly directed.

3. Recreation-or use of our spare
time-may be divided into two
classes.

a. Passive Recreation
This includes all the machine-made
amusements of radio and
movies and the synthetic diversions
of sports which we watch
but do not take an active part
in. However, the cultural possibilities
of this type of recreation 
are tremendous for they
include good drama, good music,
the enjoyment of fine pictures 
and excellent reading.

b. Active Recreation
We all derive a great satisfaction 
from actual participation
in our recreation. Taking part
in a play or a pageant or participating 
in a game are much
more satisfactory to us than
acting as a spectator.

4. Individual Recreation
a. Hobbies.
(1) Hobbies of making 
Drawing, painting, sewing, 
all handicraft.
(2) Hobbies of doing
Sports, gardening, etc.
(3) Hobbies of learning
Music, languages, etc.
(4) Hobbies of collecting.
Stamps, butterflies, stones,
etc.

5. Community Recreation
Recreational impulses in a community
should be led in a form of
community pageants, plays, songfests
festivals, folk dances, hobby
shows, etc.

Interesting Stories 
About Farmers
Union People

It is always interesting to hear
about the lives of the people who
have been associated with the Farmers
Union in the early stages of its
struggle. This time we are telling
you about Owen Frank Dornblaser,
"Uncle Dorn" to hundreds of people.

One of the most picturesque of the
organizers and lecturers connected 
with the history of the Farmers 
Union passed away at his daughter's 
home recently. For thirty-nine years
he had been untiring in his work to
further the Union cause, only resigning
from his active work last year
at the age of ninety-three. He had
written several books, among them
"The Only Way" for farmers.

An interesting bit of history in
connection with Mr. Dornblaser's
early life is reprinted from the Des
Moines, Iowa, News:
"His parents moved to Old Mud
Point, Ill., when he was young and at
thirteen years of age he was given
complete freedom of action by his
father-an unusual thing in those 
days when a family needed all the
help each member could give and
especially in the family of a 'Pennsylvania 
Dutchman' where the children
were usually held with a tight rein.

"Learning that a man in the
vicinity of his home wanted a boy
to drive a flock of sheep to Texas
and not having the faintest idea
where Texas was, he applied for the
job and got it. Starting from Illinois
when only thirteen years old he 
drove one hundred and twenty-two
Merino buck sheep to the Gulf of
Mexico. He walked the entire dis-
