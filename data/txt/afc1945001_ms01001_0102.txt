Random listening, causal exploring on the dial until one hears something
 interesting, makes radio inappropriate in this type of work. Similarly, 
street corner speeches would be inappropriate, though they might be useful
 for other campaigns. 
The direct counteraction program should be used to eliminate some 
few specific rumors but more important is its contribution to the educational campaign designed to develop sound thinking habits in the community. 
Some rumors are natural and unavoidable. They may be analyzed publicly to 
help people understand that rumors are natural. It should not be too difficult
 to help the community at large to a working comprehension of the 
psychological laws which govern the development of rumors. This approach 
would help ease some of the basic anxieties and encourage interest in the 
processes involved. 

Special campaigns should not be directed against any particular 
rumor, except in very rare cases. Sometimes a particular rumor causes serious 
trouble in and of itself, but this is so rare an occurrence that we may 
safely assume that most projects dealing with rumors will never have to 
consider this. Campaigns should be stimulated and guided by the study of rumors 
to eliminate the ignorance that begets the untrue tale. 

ILLUSTRATIVE MATERIALS

In this general discussion emphasis has been placed upon the need 
to care for rumor control progress and also special emphasis upon the forms for 
direct counter-action. Experience has shown that well-intentioned activity may 
sometimes [completely] wasted. In spite of the care which was taken in trying 
to squelch the rumors about the Eleanor Clubs, reporters still find people.
