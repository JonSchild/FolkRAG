with the typical Armenoid forehead
high and slanting back from pro-
jecting brow-ridges - a wide face
with high cheek-bones and some-
what swarthy skin - she doesn't 
believe everything Reiser tells her - I
wonder if his jaw will drop when 
he sees her boobs-

Dutton is to be here for a couple 
of days - the dead-pan I met
in the Depression Bar one night
with Cumby, Perry and Zora - 
he is a little mad and his eyes
are the coldest grey I have ever
seen - you are frozen - he drinks
a huge ammount - has beautiful
hands - a permanent sallow tan 
- a fine cut nose - slightly bald - 
very smooth manners - doesn't like
me - as very few people seem to 
do nowadays - I think I'm 
collapsing - my vocabulary has
certainly left me-
