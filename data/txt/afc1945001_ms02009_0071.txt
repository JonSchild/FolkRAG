reports should be submitted in writing, signed by the reporter. The
signature is simply a testimony of good faith; the names of reporters
should never be disclosed. In large communities, where designated
rumor reporters are used, their names should be withheld. Rumor
reports should not be taken over the telephone; first, because the
use of the telephone exaggerates the seriousness of the rumor; and
second, because the telephone encourages spontaneous conversation
about the rumor instead of considered analysis of the total body of
rumors. Rumor reports should as nearly as possible describe the
