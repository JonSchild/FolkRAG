[*A*]

A sailor was seen walking around 
the drill field picking up every
piece of paper he saw, looking at 
it, and then saying, "No, this isn't
it." This went on for two weeks 
and he began to get on everyones 
nerves. Finally he was reported 
to the captain. The captain had 
the doctor give the sailor a mental 
examination and they found he 
wasn't quite all there. When the 
captain handed the sailor his 
discharge papers, he took one 
look at it and yelled, "This is it."
