transactions for the family are carried on by her. When asked
concerning this, she said:

Yes sir, I is the head of this here family, and my
second man is living here with me and my daughter, but me
is the one that's the head. The crop is in my name and
the settlement comes to me.

When asked whether or not she and her "man" were married her reply
was:

Sir, what's that you trying to talk about here. Cose we
is married. The preacher and my children stood right here
and witnessed it. What you wants to really know is how is 
it's me that's head. Well, that man that's my husband and
I got married when my first husband died, and he had done
run away from a plantation over yonder where he was owing 
them a great crop bill. And see, if they catches up with
him and he was the head of the family, he would have to 
pay him out of what I done made. So just to be stopping
anything like that, I just go on and makes myself the head. 
He can owes all he wants, but this a way there's one thing
show - he won't be paying for nothing with my sweat.

Most of Mrs. Perkins' children by her first husband are 
married and live near her on the King and Anderson plantation. 
The girls married when they were about twelve or thirteen years of
age. When asked why so many of her girls married young, and as to
why she let them do so, she said:

Well sir, some of them just wanted to and that one down
the road who wasn't bare over twelve years this here day,
she birthed that boy's baby and now she's gone. Then there
ain't much no need for no large house of childrens now days
cause before you could work them, but now most out here
they gots tractors that does the plowing. And nobody just 
don't got no need for no big head of children.

When asked concerning what music she liked best, her reply was:

Now that's one thing I seldom does, and that's think about 
music and songs and stuff like that. But I guess I likes
any kind just so it ain't blues cause I'm a Christian and
I just don't follow nothing like that. I'm just a Christian
following like my ma taught me. Naw sir, I never was much
