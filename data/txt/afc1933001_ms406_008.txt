THE CATHOLIC PRIEST AND THE DEATH CHAMBER

Every once and a while Father Finnegan walks down a corridor of
the Huntsville Penitentiary side by side with a man on his way to death
in the execution room; on and on through the little green door, to where 
stands the cruel chair, the "hot seat," "I have been taking that 
walk for years," he said; "sixty-eight times in all." But there have
been more times since he talked to me.

Father Finnegan has a pastorate in Houston, but each week he 
drives up to Huntsville to talk with the convicts. He is a friend to 
them all. When one of them must die he may make more than one weekly
trip, for he always is standing close by the chair when the Assistant
Warden pulls the lever that lets pass the death current. "He is the 
most useful man, the one indispensable man, in the entire Texas Penitentiary
system," General Manager Simmons once said to me.

He went on to say that every convict as Huntsville honored and
trusted this modest Catholic priest. How they told him their stories,
sought his help, begged for his influence to lighten the heavy hand of
the law. One day the Father started to walk across the big yard inside 
the penitentiary walls. One man stopped him another and another and
another, each man talking low and confidentially. He patiently took 
notes and listened to them all. But it took him six hours to make the
journey of a few hundred feet.

The night before a convict must die he knows that within call close 
by sits Father Finnegan. Up to that time the condemned man mayehave
refused to see or to talk to Father Finnegan. However hysterical or 
stricken dumb by fear or grief the man may be, he finally yields to the
thought that a sympathetic friend is near to sit with him. He sends
for Father Finnegan. And Father Finnegan goes to him. If wanted he
