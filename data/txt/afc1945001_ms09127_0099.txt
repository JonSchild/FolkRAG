tool him so long to say "halt"
that every one in the squad 
marched overboard. When he got to
the front he started to shake with 
patriotism. He tried to hide behind one
of the trees but there wasn't enough 
trees for the officers.  When the captain
said we were going over the top,
he asked for a furlough. The captain 
said, "Haven't you and red blood in
you."  He replied, 'Yes, but I don't want
to see it."  When we went over the
top, the captain said to fire at will.
But he didn't know Will so he
could not fire. The fellow behind
he must of thought he was Will
because he shot him.  On his way
to the hospital he asked a doctor where 
he was going and he said he was
going to the morgue. He said he wasn't 
dead and the man said, "Do you
want to make a fool of the doctor."
