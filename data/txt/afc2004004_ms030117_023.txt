I couldn't be able to recall now what it was.  Now the rest
of em would fight me, but he wouldn't.  An he wouldn't low
no one to peck on me at all.  (When did you get your first
guitar?)  What was when we was livin on the place we called
Mr. Joe Everts place.  My mother -- after huh and huh
husband separated -- that's where we was livin at.  Huh an
my stepfather had separated then.  (Were you pleased when
she bought it for you?)  Oh yes.  I was pleased.  (there is
reservation in his voice)  Cause I always have wanted one.
She bought it.  When I was a kid a feller come through the
country pickin a guitar, you know, an I was a small child
then.  I ast my mother what it was.  She said it was a 
git-tar.  I thought twas somebody beatin a drum -- a band.
You know, a feller come through playin a git-tar.
Oh, it sounded extra good to me.  (How did it happen that
you started playing for people?)  Well, that happened by 
we would have calls in the country.  The white people sometimes 
would come by and set a while with me to hear me
play.  They would make great expressions and statements
to my mother what suc-cess I would be able to have if she
would give me over to them.  Let them carry me about.
An it seems like they enjoyed it so.  I went to a white
peoples' picnic after I learnt how to play well.  An
diff'rent places.  They would give me money.  An they would
keep me off all day an feed me.  Give me clothes.  Little
things, you know, like that.  (How much money would they
play you?)  Well, uh, you know how hard it is by country
people, you understand.  If we git a dollar or two we
declared we had money.  For six months, you understand,
