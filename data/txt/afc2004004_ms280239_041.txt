2) We had a gallant comrade, Hean Wilson was her name,
She used to come along with us for the sharing of the game,
But the captain fell in love with her and he married her straight by hand,
So she gave us the best of treatment, boys, going to Van Dieman's Land.

3) It's when we landed on the coast, ten thousand, aye, and more,
And when the natives saw us they began to shout and roar,
They marched us from the vessel boys, right up unto the strand,
So they yok-ed us up like horses boys to plough Van Dieman's Land.

Lomax: What's the background of that song, Jimmy?
McBeath: Well, they used to transport poachers all the way from
this country who were catched poaching.
Lomax: What exactly does a poacher do?
McBeath: O he caches -- he goes and poaches for salmon, rabbit & hares.
Lomax: Why is that, anyhow?
McBeath: Well, to make money out of it.
Lomax: Well, why can't he just go and catch them free?
McBeath: He goes and steals - it's a kind of stealing as it
were, going into people's private grounds or private waters ...
without a licence.  A lot of men goes and poaches  yet, and takes
rabbits and shoots and steals anything they see to make money out
of it.  And at one time of day, - at that time, they used to
transport them to the Devil's Island of Van Dieman's Land.  None
never got back again.  That's what they did with the poachers.  It
was a French ship that used to come - a four-masted frigate - it
used to come round and collect all the convicts -- they put them
as convicts in a convict ship.  And put to Van Dieman's Land
or the Devil's Island for the rest of their life.
Lomax: That was off in the East Indies somwhere, wasn't it?
McBeath:  Van Dieman's in Australia, nd the Devil's Island is out
in that part, too.
Lomax: Did you ever know of anybody's family who ...?
McBeath: Yes .... a lot of families up there in Streithside ... the
Wilson family .. a family of Wilsons up there was put away about
a hundred years ago ... Some of the sons and daughters .. They were
awful cruel at that time.  The laws were different at that time.
