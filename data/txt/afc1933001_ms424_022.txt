DIXIE LAND
(America)
(Page 178 - Old Favorite Songs)


I wish I was in de land ob cotton, old times dar am not forgotten!
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
In Dixie Land whar I was born in, early on one frosty morning,
Look away! Look away! Look away! O Dixie Land.

Chorus: Don' I wish I was in Dixie, Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray!
In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand, to lib and die in Dixie.
Away, away, away, down south in Dixie.


MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME

(Page 238 - Old Favorite Songs)


The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay;
The corn-top's ripe and the meadow's are in bloom
While the birds make music all the day.
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
All merry, all happy and bright,
By'n by hard times comes a-knocking at the door,
Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

Chorus: Weep no more my lady, Oh! weep no more today,
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home
For the old Kentucky home far away.

They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,
On the meadow, the hill and the shore.
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon
On the bench by the old cabin door.
The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,
With sorrow where all was delight,
The time has come when the darkies have to part,
Then my old Kentucky home, good night!

Chorus: Weep no more my lady, Oh! weep no more today,
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home
For the old Kentucky home far away.
