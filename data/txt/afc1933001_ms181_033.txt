Mr. Cleveland Benoit
c/o Postmaster
Jennings, La.

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning to make up a
group of the best representative American folk songs to be
distributed in Latin America. Among the songs we hope to
use is your performance of "Malheureuse Negre" which you 
recorded for us. We will pay you $4.00 for the use of
this record which occupies 1/3 of a 12" record and we will 
send you two copies of it for your own use. 

I hope you will give us your permission to use this song by
signing and returning the enclosed form as soon as possible.
All the records will carry the legend, "For non-commercial 
use only" and of course your name will appear on every record.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
