Mr. Chapman is a chief,
Brave [as] a man as ever lived
Never ran and never will.
His main occupation is
Taking copper still.

Mr. Rivers take a quart;
Mr. Ferd took a pint;
Mr. Chapman has to have
The whole damn jinte.

He'll run and put you
in Kahoma County Jail;
You can get Bud Doggett
To go your bail.
Hear 
[He say] that cop'll fine you
For possession and sale;
In six long months
In Kahoma County Jail.

Now you may come here
Big and stout,
But these flat iron banks
will wear your black ass out.
