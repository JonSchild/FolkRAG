Captain Pearl R.Nye--Akron, Ohio

"The last of the Ohio canal captains", Captain Pearl R.Nye of Akron, Chio, calls
himself. Capt. Nye was introduced to us by Mrs.Helen Waterhouse, his biographer
and a well-known newspaper woman on the Akron Beacon-Journal. For two full
days and far into the night he sang into the microphone. "Ream after ream", literally, 
of song texts and verse he drew from his pocket, done into long rolls by

ballads from his mother who was a Virginian, sea-shanteys, canal work-songs,[*spirituals learned from Ky. negros*]
play-party Od dnace tunes with words, lullabies and other children's songs,
and many "funny" songs. "I was blessed with comical parents", he says. "There

[eleventh] 15th child. I can't think in terms of old age.There were never less than ten of us children on board all
the time. We lived and ate and slept and did our washing, everything, right on
board the canal boat, and for a bath-tub, well we had one mighty handy; our
parents would just hold the kids overboard by the heel in the canal, or
throw us in and let us swim back to the boat.

"Music controlled our home. " Our father played the fiddle and Mother the Jews Harp. Of an
evening we'd all gather around them and sing. We had a mighty good time by ourselves, 
but [when we were] very often other folks would gather on our stern
deck and we'd have a sure enough jollification. As I said, we were blessed with
