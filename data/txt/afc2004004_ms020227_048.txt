very few women nurse they babies, in, in they, you know, on, on 
the breas', now.  But it is true.  If that baby started gittin' 
sick, you know, an', an' you carry -- He gonna git sick, if he's 
nursin'.  You take 'im to the doctor 'an the doctor say, "You 
be sucklin' him bad milk."  Co'se they got a lot a good things 
now for it, mo' than they had then, to try to cure 'em.  But you 
got to stop nursin' 'im.  An' put 'im on a bottle.

BJ:  No, not all of 'em didn't.  Some folks had habit of wean-
