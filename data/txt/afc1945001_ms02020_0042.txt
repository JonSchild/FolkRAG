Dear Mr. Kaiser;
            In regard to the information for Facts and Information
I again repeat that the public have taken to heart the warning not to
discuss information which would help the enemy. In regard to the German
spies many think they should have been shot immediately. When people pay the
prices on fruit and vegatables they say the Japanese did play a part in
agriculture but they would rather pay high prices and have the Japanese
interned. Many people speak of the fun they have had with their victory
gardens as well as hard work and good results. More are asking for books
on poultry, bees, rabbitts etc.
            In regard to the fair rent division most people are
very willing to comply. Many landlords who have rented their homes for
low prices now cannot get what they are worth and surprising their are
quite a few. On the other hand many tenants are glad of this as some
landlords have been very unreasonable in their charges. A real estate man
resented the fact that the government would not allow homes to be built.
If homes could be built in these congested districts it would do away
with high rents and men could buy a home while getting good wages.
In the Laurel-Allendale districts families live in stores and
high prices are asked for very poor homes.
            People are very much disturbed about the rubber shortage and
the governments handling of the same; also about the neglect of opening
up a second front in Europe, the slowness of breaking with Vichy France
and sinking of so many ships.
                                                  Sincerely
                                                                    Louise Roinestad
