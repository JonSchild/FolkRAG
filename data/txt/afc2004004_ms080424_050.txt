Tape:  Roll 50 Stanley in the woods
Stan:  This thing brings in the crows.  Now it (unint.) finished up,
and they come in by bushels of 'em.  Like this is callin' up a 
young crow, and they think it's a young crow, somethin' in rhythm.
So I'm gonna try it here and see how it does.  (plays)
That brings 'em in you see.  It died out there you see and it done
shot all the crows.  Shot all the crows, you see, and then
