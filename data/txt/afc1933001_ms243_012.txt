should feel justified in dealing so
ungenerously with me.

I think my telegram to you
about Mrs. Tartt covered the
case. I doubt if I could
make the trip next Spring. 
I also doubt if you will
have any money left next
Spring for any such expenditure. 
With you, I begin to lose
faith in memos.

Thank you for returning
the New York Times clipping.

I do not like to think of 
you living in a "tourist camp."
No one would enjoy a real
home more than you. I regret 
every day you deny yourself
[of] the quiet and rest of a real
home when the day's work is done.
Lovingly always, Father
