Dear Alan
Here are some Phila. notes 
that may be helpful.
(1) Harold S. Kaufman, teacher at 
the Bartenders Union here, was a 
"pal" and composer for "Charlie Harris" - 
playing in honkytonks with him back 
in Milwaukee and collaborating on 
"After the Ball" etc. He knew (says he 
sang) at Tony Pastor's - has memories 
of Harrigan and Hart etc. Will reminisce 
but not write out anything. Is a 
frustrated song writer due to Charlie 
Harris' double-crossing him, liquor,
and need for hard cash. Incidentally 
he's a wizard bartender. May be 
reached at the Union or- sans 
glory - at his home, 29 Heather Rd. 
Upper Darby 
(2) Jerome Lee (colored) 1441 Carpenter St. once sec'y 
Am Fed Musicians. Has collected 
music - MS and printed - of every 
type for years. Says he has 
songsters etc in his packing boxes -
