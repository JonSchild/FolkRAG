Dear Alan: 
I have your somewhat distressing letter of the 21st 
on a subject with which, unfortunately, I had nothing 
to do and about which, therefore, I was in considerable 
ignorance until I got your letter. On the basis of 
that letter, the reply of the Legal Department seems 
to me quite reasonable. I don't see how you can 
expect a company that is in business to make a profit 
can be expected to pay money unless (1) it is 
legally required to do so, or (2) has made a moral 
commitment. As to the first, all we have asked is 
that you tell us what this legal commitment is. As 
to the second, I am afraid that you do not make out 
a clear case because the implication of the second 
paragraph of your letter is that Burl Ives was the 
guy who made the moral commitment and who promised
to tell us about it. Honestly, Alan, I can't see what 
we have done to disturb what you happily call "a
friendly relationship". 

I certainly don't want to get into a legalistic 
tangle, but I should be grateful if you will 
straighten me out of the thing to the extent that 
I am wrong. As to coming down to Washington to hear 
some "real American music" sometime, I shall continue 
to look forward to the prospect. 
Sincerely yours, 
[?]
