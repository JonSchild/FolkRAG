Mrs. Rosa Warren Wilson
Martins Point

Dear Mrs. Wilson:

This is to acknowledge your letter of July 21.
Much as we sympathize with the work you are doing
and appreciate your kindness in arranging for the 
recording, we cannot reimburse you except for authorized
expenditures. If you think that any of your
expenditures fall under this heading, you will have
to furnish an itemized account which will have to be
approved by Mr. John Lomax before it can be considered
by the Library.

I want to thank you again for allowing Mr. Lomax
to record Plantation Echoes.

Very truly yours,

Acting Chief, Division of Music
