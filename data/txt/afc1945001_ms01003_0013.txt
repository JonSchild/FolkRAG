Washington, D.C.

Dear Admiral Wilkinson:

Mr. Herter has turned over to me the 
excellent memorandum on rumor policy sent you by 
Mr. Will Stevens of the Vallejo, California, 
Morning Times-Herald.

We have already been at work in the Bureau 
of Intelligence trying to set up a scheme which will 
enable us to find out what rumors are current, who 
circulates them and how they can be prevented or 
counteracted. Our delay in replying to you about 
the matter has been due to the time taken up in our 
Bureau discussing the whole rumor question, of which 
this is a part.

Mr. Stevens' suggestions fit in rather well 
with one of our projected methods, and we have a written 
him to that effect. Once our scheme goes into operation, 
we shall probably call on him for his assistance.

Sincerely yours,
[signature]
R. Keith Kane
Assistant Director
In Charge, Bureau of 
Intelligence
