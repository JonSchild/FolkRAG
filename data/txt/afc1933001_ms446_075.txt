60 

The cross before the crown. 

There is a battle to be fought, 
An upward race to run ; 
A crown of glory to be sought,
A victory to be won. 

No. 60 

Attend, young friends, while I relate
The dangers you are in--
The evils that around you wait
While subject unto sin. 

Although you flourish like the rose, 
While in its branches green, 
Your sparkling eyes in death must close-- 
No more will they be seen. 

In silent shades you must lie down,
Long in your graves to dwell-- 
Your frinds will then stand weeping round
And bid a long farewell. 

How small this world will then appear, 
At that tremendous hour. 
When you Jehovah's voice shall hear, 
And feel his mighty power. 

In vain you'll mourn---your days are past--
Alas ! those days are gone--
Your golden hours are spent at last,
And never will return. 

O !  come this moment, and begin
While life's sweet moments last ; 
Turn to the Lord, forsake all sin,
And he'll forgive the past.
