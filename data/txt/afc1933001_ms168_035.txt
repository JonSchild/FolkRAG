Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was indeed sorry to learn from your letter of February
26th that you were unable to make use of the review copy of TRADITIONAL
MUSIC OF AMERICA, which I had sent to you last November, in
response to your request. I hope that your statement that the book
is not of a type which you could review for serious scholarly publications
does not signify that you do feel that the book has
merits and value for less formal use

Do you not feel that Mr. Ford has brought together in his
book a considerable amount of authentic American folk material, which
has not appeared in previous volumes, dealing with the primitive music
of America, and do you not feel that the book can justifiably be
recommended as interesting source material for all who desire to familiarize
themselves with the origins of our post-colonial fiddle tunes,
patriotic songs, dance tunes and calls?

I would indeed appreciate a further word or two from you
about Mr. Ford's book, if you can find time to write me again about it.

Very truly yours,
H.H. Ward
