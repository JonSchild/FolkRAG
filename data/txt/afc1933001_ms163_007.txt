Types of Songs:

English Ballad, sung largely without accompaniment from
all states mentioned in the geographical summary.

Occupational Ballads, and Lumberjack Songs from Vermont
and Michigan.

Cowboy Songs from Texas.

Miners' Songs from California and Kentucky, and etc.

American Local Ballads, having to do with crimes, disasters,
love tragedies, desperadoes and the like.

A large number of miscellaneous lyric songs, accompanied
and unaccompanied from all sections of the country.

Folk Dance tunes played on fiddles, banjos, dulcimer, 
and guitar and combinations of those various instruments from
various sections of the country and linguistic groups.

Children's Game Songs from all parts of the country and
in many languages, especially Spanish.

White Spirituals and Hymns from the South, especially
interesting are sacred songs from the old Sharpnote Hymn book
of the late eighteenth century.

Negro Spirituals from the South and especially unusual are
a group from the Bahama Islands.

Negro Work Songs from the South with a large and full collection
from Haiti.

Negro Blues and many miscellaneous types of songs from the 
South.

The Haitian recordings, 300 in number, may also prove to
be useful for comparison with Brazilian material. Accompaning these
records are such instruments as drums of various kinds, rattles and
bamboo horns and guitars.

I look forward with great anticipation to a long continued
and fruitful period of exchange between the two folk song collections.
yours in Brazil and ours in the United States.
