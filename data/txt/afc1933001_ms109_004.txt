Darling:

This is a note to tell you how
insanely happy I was to have
even your words of reproach.
(And they were so well justified
I have no complains to make.)

I am very busy at this
moment, but had to tell you
that I love you.

I am glad to hear the
address will arrive soon.

Can you send me the slip
permitting me to buy records.
I have found all sort of
exciting things here.
