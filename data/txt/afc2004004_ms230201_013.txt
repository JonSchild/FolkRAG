that they got down there on those chain gains with big balls hangin'
on they legs.  An' those [sck] shackles an things on they legs. Well, 
those fellas---[are] walkin' aroun' right now, can't go [any] no place,
unless a guard right over 'em [all the time]--- those fellas have the
blues, too. 

The Kid:  
Yeah. I remember a friend of mine was down there.  Of course
he was in a much badder place than what you're talkin' about. 
They was so tough down there, they didn't put those things on 
they legs.  They let 'em go. They tell 'em to run, you know.
"RUN!" (He says it so you can hear the voice of the guard talking
 to the black prisoner--- the guard with the rifle in his 
 hands.)

Natchez: 
See if he can git out the way of those hounds and guns and
things!

The Kid: 
Yeah. 

Natchez:  
The dogs is there to track you to wheresonever you run to.

The Kid:  
Yeah, the dogs track you down, if you try to get away...

(Here, again, the record ended.  Natchez had failed [xxxx] to make
his point about Southern life being the same for a Negro as life 
in prison.  The Kid was full of memories that were too painful.  But
Natchez had shown him that the lash was the blues, itself, and
in the end more painful that the sensual priviledges allowed the
Negro prisoners.  As for the camps, the blues part was that you 
couldn't get away.)
