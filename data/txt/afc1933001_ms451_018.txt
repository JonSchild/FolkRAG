[*For Ruth*]
Duncan and Brady
Nobody knows where Brady "wore his shining star" or in
what ally or saloon Duncan was bartender. You get the idea,
However, that when Duncan cooled Brady's fever down with a forty-
four, that nobody shed many tears, that all the ladies were
greatly pleased, In fact-
"When the women in Ioway heard the news,
They wrote it down in old red shoes,"
A field day for the ladies, when old King Brady, the
bullying peace officer got "blowed down."
Miss Scarborough has recorded versions in Texas, Odam
and Johnson fragments in Tennessee and we have others from
Texas. A person on the train sang it to me once the way she
had heard it in a caravan show in Kansas. The song probably
comes, therefore, from West of the Mississippi and we have
made free to combine the scattered stanzas so that they tell
the story again the way the original may have had it.
Brady, had a forty-five,
Said it would shoot half a mile,
Duncan had a forty-four,
And that's what laid poor Brady low.
Chorus: Out on the Charley, God knows.
[Mr.] Duncan, was behind the bar,
When in walked Brady with a shining star;
Cried, "Duncan, Duncan, you are under arrest!"
An' Duncan [put a bullet] shot a hole in Brady's breast.
Brady cried his level best,
"Duncan, don't kill me, you've got me best,
Duncan says, "Brady, if I got you best,
You'll hear this forty-four pop in Brady's breast[s]."
