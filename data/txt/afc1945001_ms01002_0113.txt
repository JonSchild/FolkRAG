3. COUNTERACTION OF RUMORS.

There are two methods of  counteracting rumors:

A. Direct Counteraction

means an outfight refutation of the rumor by 
blanket denial ("It isn't so") or by authoritative 
report (giving the true facts). In 
either case, the explicit citation of the rumor 
(reproduction of, and designation as, rumor) 
is involved.

In the main, this method is to be avoided as 
it may arouse public suspicion of the Government's 
motive in refuting the rumor and confusion 
as between rumor and refutation.

B. Indirect Counteraction
 
recognizes that rumors are often born of malevolent 
intention but that they always breed 
on ignorance, curiosity, and confusion. Indirect 
counteraction seeks to correct, or prevent, 
rumors by attacking the conditions which 
lead to their diffusion:

a. by supplying adequate information to the
public on problems about which there are 
rumors.

b. by collaborating with the press and radio 
in preventing the dissemination of rumor-breeding 
or rumor-bred data.

c. by publicly explaining the process of rumor 
development and dissemination ----- 
exposing its conscious originators and ridiculing, 
as well as educating, its unwitting 
carriers.
