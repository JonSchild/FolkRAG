Then that brave Mameluke drew his trusty chabook,
Crying "Allah il Allah Akbar,"
And with murder intent, he ferociously went
At Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

The Sultan rode up the disturbance to quell,
Or to give to the victor a cheer,
But he arrived just in time to take hasty farewell,
Of Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer,

Then Gotchikoff, Skabeloff, Menchikoff too,
Drove up in the Emperor's car,
But only in time to bid rapid adieu
To Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

There lieth a stone where the Danube doth roll,
And on it in characters clear,
Is, "Stranger, remember to pray for the soul
Of Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer."

The Muscovite maiden her sad vigil keeps
In her home by the cold Northern star,
And the name that she murmurs so oft in her sleep
Is Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.
