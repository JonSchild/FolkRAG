THE ROMISH LADY

   Back of [the Ku Klux] Southern prejudice[s] against the Catholic[s] Church
[are] was hair-raising propaganda [stories] like [this] this old churchly ballad. Protestant children,
especially in the South, were raised on [them] and stories.  An old lady
in Southern Indiana confided once that, until she came to the city, she thought Catholics
were the next things to devils [until she grew up and came to 
the city].  Nowadays, she says, [the] her best friend [she has] is a Catholic.
Blaine Stubblefield, who grew up in back country, [from] Oregon [said] recalls that of the four books on
the family organ, one [consisted of] contained tales of the Inquisition,
horrifically  illustrated, and another recounted with gusto the
private lives of merry monks and nuns.  It took him years to
pluck up his courage to the point of actually entering a Catholic church. 
   To this evidence Mrs. Minnie Floyd of Murrells
Inlet, S. C. , adds her voice,  showing how important and how
dear not only this ballad but all ballads once were to the
rural people of the Southern United States.
   "I learned The Romish Lady where I used to learn all
of 'em, from my grandfather and my mother.  He learned 'em from
his daddy.  They was old-timey,  you know.  The Roman Catholics,
they don't put 'em to the stake and burn 'em now, like they
used to but I heard my grandfather say that his grand-daddy used
to go see 'em burn to the stake.  They used to do this when [they] some Catholics disobeyed the rules.
   Now this girl, she'd got in touch with the
Protestants some way, and found out.  The old Catholics never
used to let 'em see a Bible, nor they didn't know right from
wrong, nothing except just what the priest told 'em and they had
to do just what he said.  (And it's a whole lot thataway yet.)
