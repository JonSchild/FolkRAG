[*CASSUR'S SNAKE FIGHT*]
about a long time...Said she's playin' with the rats. An so the
rats eatin' up her food. I knowed the rat would be there because
I had plenty food there for her to eat an' the rat would be there,
ya know, then this old log house, too. An' it had a log crib out
in the back, way back yonder somewhere or other. An' so it [go] kep' on
like that. [some way or another]. One day me an' Cassius came in
there early; it got hot. We had [scuffanine] scuppernine (scuppernong) (little bushes that 
look like grapes, [scuffanine] scuppernine grapes, BJ says) wine an' plum wine.
Cassius wen' in there to strain the wine, in the kitchen, gonna
strain the wine. Nelly and I was on the porch. Ed was in the yard
under the tree an' wash [fence] bench -- you know, I had a wash [fence] bench out
there -- layin' down out there. We stayed there until Cassius got
through with the wine, was about, almost two o'clock. You know,
cause all of us was workin'. Ed was workin' his own farm, an' I 
was workin' by the acre, you know. We'd go back 'till it gets
cool enough. An' this snake, you see, we jus' stayed too long;
that's how we found out it wasn't a rabbit -- see, she called it
a rabbit, but I thought she meant rat, ya see? But the whole 
thing, she meant snake. An' so, he came out on the porch an' looked
in the side of the porch, an' Nelly seen him. Nelly, she called
Ed "Nickles." She said, "Nickles, look yonder, what a snake!"
An' he's scared a snakes. An' he jumped. That was a...said, "Great
God." He wanta run, so, Cassius come out the house. Cassius said
"Where is it?" We looked, an' he was goin' back into the loft of
the house, you know, over the ??? top of the porch into the lof'
of the house.  Between them logs, see? Cassius said, "I'll git 'im."
He'd taken the door bar off; we'd had a door bar across the door.
You know, then old-time bars. He taken that door bar off across the 
door an' he went up, up in the lof'.  An' when he got there, he
mounted them. He went right ov' [the top] one of them logs an' they hooked 
ov' them logs. By that time another was there. An' [another] 'nother. An'
he was killin'. He was fighten 'em up there in that lof', I'm tellin'
you, with that...an' he's hol'in' that one there an' hittin' the other
with that stick. He's still holdin' that one by the tail, that was
winded around the log. An' then he...the [boat was comin'] board come loose, [see] by
the tusslin' up there, an' this lil' [boat cover (?)] board come loose up there ---
big [boat] board, in a big lof', wide [boat] board, an' he jus' pushed the [boat] board ba ck
an' dropped the the snakes down in the flo' -- there's two of 'em.
