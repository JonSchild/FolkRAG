Fisk, 8. 4. HAFFER.
H: Yessir, and we said this:
STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING
Strange things happening in the land,
Strange things happening in the land,
Oh, what's going on?
Call out no mo,
Strange things happening in the l and,

Oh, you read the Holy Bible
Matthew does record
Pestilence and earthquake,
And all sorts of war.
You see it's God's own will,
The Bible would it tell
The Strange things happening in the land,

Nations against nations,
Rising up in this land;
Kingdoms against kingdoms,
You better understand,
No need being surprised;
The end's drawing nigh;
There's strange things happening in the land.

That way it goes, sir.
A: You don't remember any other words? I'd like to record all of it
because that's a very stirring account.

Daniel spoke about it,
And the Revelations, too; 
Jesus of Stature awaited it,
From the promising must come tru.
God take lives,
He declares men must die;
Strange things happening in the land.

Now Wilson said to the Kaiser,
"Please let out vessels be."
Kaiser said to Wilson,
"Keep your vessels off of the sea;
If you put em on the streams
They''ll meet my submarines."

The Kaiser kept on destroying
Every vessel he could see;
So he treated us so mean
With those dreadful submarines.
Strange things happening in the land.
Strange things happening in the land.
Strange things happening in the land.

I say war's goin on,
