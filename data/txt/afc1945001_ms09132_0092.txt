F. N. M

A Civilian was called to the Army, and he took
his week furlough. When he arrived at the camp he was
always looking for something, but he was always saying
"that's not it", "that's not it." Finally the various
officials and the commanding officer decided that the 
soilder was crazy. The commanding officer called the 
soilder to his office and gave him his papers, and
told him that he was released from the service, and the
soldier replied, "that is it."

Buy a bond, a bond will buy a bomb and a 
bomb will sink an enemy battleship.
