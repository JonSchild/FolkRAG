from them nasty ones.  That's right.
An' this colored man asked-askted them, "Why is it that they
so hard against the, the black man?"  He's -- an' then they asked
'im -- he said, "Why is it that I'm the color I am?...Why is it
that I'm, that I'm the color I am?"  He's just about white.  He
asked 'em, "How come it?"  An' look where he sits.  See, he got a
big plantation out there in the country, this colored man.  Had a 
lot of 'em, too.  You know, got, you know, land an' stuff around
there now.  You know, good thing.  An' um, but he asked 'em that
question.
An' boy, then...An' it before them FBI's, too.  They, they
tol' 'em, "That, that's a good question to ask: 'Why is it that
I'm the color I am?  an' yet you so against the black man.'  "

up there.  An', you know, to see nobody.  An', [you know] they would go
early enough so, at that time, so they would-wouldn't be on the
streets at night.  You know, goin' through there at night.  They

An' that ain't been too long ago.  That just started from some
kinda row.  But they got mad because the FBI's come, see?  'Cause
that what made 'em real mad.
An' so, jus' a few aroun' there never did have -- An' the un-
understakers an' the diffrunt ones had great, you know, long pieces
in the paper, you know, pieces in the paper.  I mean the colored.  An'
the colored doctors an' diffrunt things, an', you know, talk up for
the peoples an' up for the folks there, an' everything.  They asked
'em wh-what had they done.  Ain't done anything.
