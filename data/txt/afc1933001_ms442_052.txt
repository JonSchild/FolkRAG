Dear Mr. Lomax:

                     Enclosed transcriptions of Irene,
Elnora, Medicine Man, Governor Pat Neff, Julie
Ann Johnson, Ha Ha Thisaway, and Governor O.K.
Allen.  This leaves the following still oustan-
ding:  Red Cross Sto' ,  Mr. Tom Hughes Town,
and Alberta of which I'll send you another copy.
Days In the Workhouse for which I should like
to have the texts if you can send them to me.

                   I made a mistake on my list, p. 2;
the 56 melodies do not include Way Over In The
Promised Land ; of that melody I did not send a
transcription.

                   I had no trouble with the texts of
these songs ; on the record for Elnora I find af-
ter the last chorus the verse :

            Looky here, Elnora,
            O, Lawd,
            Looky here, Elnora, [capital O stricken through with capital X]
            O, Lawd.

                   For the Cotton Picking song, numbering
the stanzas of your text, the record contains :
stanzas 1,2,3,1,  then a stanza:

            What's the matter?  Pick a bale o' cotton,
            What's the matter?  Pick a bale a day.

Then stanzas 2, 8, 1, and the record breaks off probab-
ly in stanza 5.   In the other songs your texts give ex-
actly what the records have , except for Medicine Man
which has more stanzas , and some divergence in the spo-
ken portions of some songs.

                      The records taken in prison, to be compared
with those taken out of prison came from Washington, so
I have now here in addition to the records on the pre-
vious list also:
