John A. Lomax, Esq.
University Station
Austin, Texas

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter of the 3d and am
glad to hear that you are quite recovered
and returned to full activity.

I shall be interested to listen to 
the Pastores records when they arrive and 
let you know what I think of them.

You will automatically receive six
copies of the Quarterly when it comes off
the press.  It should be out within the
next week or ten days.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
