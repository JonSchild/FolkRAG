Dear Alan:

The shipment of 12" we expected daily when you left
arrived here Jan. 4, were annealed the same day and were shipped
the same day to Universal Carlaoding who take care of all foreign
shipments. No boat left until Saturday apparently for they
went SS Luna, leaving NY then.

While I know this has held you up, please do not be so
hasty with your collect telegrams. We have no control over transportation
strikes and holdups and did everything we could to hasten
things. We had plenty of 10" and when we got your air mail
letter, I took fifty to the express office that same Sat., the
2nd. The express office reported back Monday that the shipment
would cost $10 so I held it up for I knew the charge would not
be OK'd and furthermore the 12" discs arrived here the same Monday.

Frankly I feel we cooperated with you to the limit on
getting your outfit ready and if we had received some definite
information suitably in advanve, might have reserved discs here
for you when you came. We are in business and have to work on
some kind of a business basis. Right now we have no actual order
for the discs sent and good business would demand that we had an
order from the library before we ship. That part is OK but I merely
want you to see our side of the picture.

I have sent copy of your telegram to the library in
order to collect the $4.35 charges on it. With best wishes,
Sincerely yours,
Lincoln Thompson
