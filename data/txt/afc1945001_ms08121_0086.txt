Don't spread rumors.
Be a loyal American, to your country
 & your flag. Don't tell your
neighbors your son or friend
is in this camp or at another place.
Don't tell he is over saes or on the ocean.
This my cause this other person of
whom you are talking about lose
his life so close your lips on
things that might help out enimies.
Everyone must have closed lips in
times like this. People don't realize 
people are not always Americans
just because they live here
no side they may be just the
person you are talking to be
a spy. of course you say
Oh no not that person he's
or she's my best friend but
your not always right. "So."
Don't spread rumors.
