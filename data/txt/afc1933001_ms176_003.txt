Mr. Fletcher Collins, Jr.
Route 4
Burlington, N.C.

Dear Mr. Collins:

We are waiting anxiously to hear
from you about your recording project.
The machine is being held for you, but
the project should be initiated this
Fall, if possible.

The correspondence between
Dr.Spivacke and the leadership of your
committee seems to be progressing in
a satisfactory fashion. I do hope that
we can get some ballad records out
this year. I have so many on hand
that should be published.

Regards,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
