Washington, D. C.

Att: Mr. Lomax:

Dear Mr. Alsberg:

I had a conference with Professor L. L. Dantzler, head of the Department
of English of the University of Kentucky, on Wednesday of
this week, and during the discussion the question of folklore arose,
and I told him of your trip which you had proposed for Kentucky
and that you wished to take some recordings of dialect, singing,
etc., in the State.

He is very anxious to meet you when you make this trip, and to accompany
you in some of this work since his specialty is in grammar
and speech.  He expects to be in Washington during the holidays and
I gave him your name and address at Writers' Headquarters, and I 
feel that you will find him a very interesting man and one who will
be able to render some service to you.

Professor Dantzler is preparing the Introductory Essay for the
State Guide, on Literature in Kentucky.  If you care to write him
you may do so by addressing him at the University of Kentucky in
Lexington, Kentucky.

Very truly yours,

WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION IN KENTUCKY
