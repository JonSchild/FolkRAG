Dear Mr. Pipes:

   I talked to Haygood of the Rosenwald Foundation over
the phone the other night and he told me that I could still send
in the applications for the two or three fellowships I am still
interested in.  I will get to this within the next week.  Naturally,
I am glad that we didn't go past the deadline.
   Doubtless, you will hear directly from them in this
connection.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Division of Educational Services
