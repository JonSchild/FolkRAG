     Hey---
  
     I'm gon be late all day
     With ol Freddie Mae.
(speaking:)
     Them big sons a guns --they steppin! (laughs)
They steppin with me.  They pullin me up the levee!  They
pullin me up the levee.  I'm just raring back on the lines.
Them big (sons?) were tough.  They'd get on, on top a that. . 
oh, nah, you gonna chuck?. . .
(TECHNICAL AJUSTMENTS HERE)
. . .that ring on them lines make it heavy.  I'd just raise that
line up the crown of they head, just that way and they'd go
right down there.  I said, "Bap!" --scattered it on down.
Right on down and off that levee I'd go.  So, they take me off
that and put me on a tractor.  So, say, (unintelligble) was
there, shakin a plow.  So, say, well. . . well, (Blank?) say,
"Here come that. . is that William S. Hart?, he worked for
Floyd Jones.  What he doin down here?"  I say, "Well, man, I  go
everywhere cos I ain't no one-man man, and I go everywhere
they're payin good money."  So, I went on down there, say,
"Alright, I want you to get that tractor sittin near."
I got that tractor, went on it (pauses for passing truck). . .
. . .He say, "Well. . some a you ol scamps gonna lose - some a
you all's gonna lose a tractor."  They say, "What you mean
lose a tractor, ain't that William S. Hart comin down
yonder?"  Boy, they used to standin'. . --I used to go by a
camp in them. . they all knowed. . --alot a boys knowed me in
those days.  "Come on back aroun' for me!"  Yeah, I jumped on 
that tractor, go on up there an get me a load right quick an
come on back, the boss man come up.  He said, "Who's that boy,
yonder?".  He said, "That's William S. Hart".  "Where he
come?".  "Floyd Jones".  "Do he wanna work?"  He said, "Yeah".
"Well, tell him to keep that tractor" (laughs).  "Give him
something else to do."  So they stopped doin that, they
wouldn't let me drive the tractors, when I come by they'd
say, "Hey!  It's (unintelligible)", or something like that.
I said, "Wha?".  So, --(unintelligible), Lord have mercy!
I went on in there and got me a load, an come on out, like
they slow gettin up levees, you know?  You can go. . the way
some of them run, they makes. . you know, --two of em go up
side and side.  I'd pass him on a run, goin up.  Goin on up,
goin on up.  And when that man throw that clod on up, turn her
right back there, and, if the dirt be loose, I'd just keep
a-going.  But. . 
Man off-cam:
     (What you pullin?)?
W.S.H.:
