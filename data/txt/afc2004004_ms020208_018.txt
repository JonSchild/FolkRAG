Reverend Roe. Reel 12. P. 3
running like somebody mad[e him].
Well now I believe if people, if there's something put on you or get in you
can hurt you, why, that's poison. [I'm] That's no conjur[er]. But say somebody
put something down, why I don't believe nothing like that.
A: Well, Reverend, haven't members of your congregation come to you to get
you to help them lay ghosts thst were bothering them, spirits and things?
Noo conjure, but just supernatural things, haven't they ever cometo
you for help like that?.
R: No, not for nothing like that I never had [them] any of them come to me, mostly
for some kind of sickness that [they think they] my they conjured my something bathhot and I always
get that out of them; I [bak] talk that out of them because I don't believe
it, you know. And I tell you it's a very foolish thing.
And there was an old man there in a [hibe] white fellow's house on a farm, and
they wnated to get him out, they wanted some renters, you know, and he
wanted to get the old man out [bu] and he wouldn't move, so there's a 
fellow [some say] told him "I move him." He said, "Well, I give you $5 to get
himout." And he went and got him some flour, and he went all around
that house that night and just put a trail of that flour all the way
around his house and went on back home. And the next mornign that
old fellow got up, and he looked out the door and seen it, and looked
out the winodw and seen it, all around his house. and he got [in] him some
clothes & got [in a robe] up in his answers, and he taken [andstarts d] a running, start off that prch, jumped [off] over
it [that porch and started running (laughter). Yeh,] and they couldn't,
a sheriff couldn't got him back in that house (laughter). He thought
[itxwas cursed] somebody had conjured him. Well, that was [how children had do, that is] down here in Red River, in Red River bottom [everybody., yessir] he believed in it, you know.
But our people don't believe in [it] that so much now like they used to. No,
they don't, just a few of em. And then another thing, we have so many
people around that's making moay on such stuff as that, and they claim 
that they can cure diseases and they get our people there tell another birth & and they
tell em on such-and-such a time didn't such-and-such a thing happen[ed], didn't
