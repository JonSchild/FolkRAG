Dear Friends:                                                                        [*copied as LWO-3365 dated 7/7/61*]
About a year and one-half ago, you copied
for me the 1941-42 recordings of Texas Gladden and
Hobart Smith for commercial reissue. Unfortunately,
these tapes were lost by the company who had them.
I would now like you to duplicate them for me with 
full fidelity so I can make another attempt to find
an outlet for this material for my two old friends.
If you will send me an estimate of the cost for
this dubbing, I will send you a check by return mail.
Let me emphasize that this transaction
involves no profit for myself and a very small return
for the two singers involved.

With all best regards, I am
Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
