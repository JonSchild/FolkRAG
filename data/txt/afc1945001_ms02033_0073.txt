On Rumors Current in the Quincy Area
From August 3, 1942 through August 8, 1942

A neatly dressed man called at this office on August 4, 1942
and requested information as to what amount he could expect to receive
in the form of Old-Age Benefits when he attained age 65. He stated
that he was 40 years of age and had never worked a day in his life.
The provisions of the Social Security Act were explained to his
apparent satisfaction.

He very leisurely but purposely digressed to other subjects
not directly related to this program. His manner was arrogant and
he had all the earmarks of a "wise guy."

I. He stated that he had attempted to secure
employment at the Hingham Shipyard but had been
rejected despite the fact that he had definite
shipbuilding talent to offer; that he had heard and
knew that youngsters just out of school were being
placed in the better jobs, while experienced older
men were required to work at lower rates of pay; that
he attributed the whole unfair system to a group of
misfits and fifth columnists in the key positions.

II. He then proceeded to the story of an
alleged friend who had invented a boat that was
unsinkable even though riddled with holes and would
stay afloat similar to a canoe filled with water.
The friend allegedly offered his idea to the Navy
Department, but they were not interested and "turned
it down cold."
