AL  How do you feel when you go to these
audiences in Nova Scotia and, and in France?  I mean that

than if I go to the midwest or in the northwest.  For
instance, in Seattle there's two different groups that plays
Cajun music.  It's just, in California, you'd be amazed at
the people that plays Cajun music.  And it's all through the
effort of, of my family and, and my friends.  I've always

something that's very delicate, something that should be
preserved.  Because I'll be gone in a few years.  But I hope
that Cajun music will live on and on and on and on.

subtle ones that you like to play so much.
