Anecdote 

This actually happened in San Francisco 
recently.  When Captain Frederick C. Sherman 
(now a Rear Admiral) of the ill-fated 
Lexington arrived here -- he wore only his 
dungarees -- and those were borrowed. 
He set out to buy a new outfit and, 
while en rout to a naval tailor, he stopped 
at a 5 & 10 to get some toothpaste, tooth 
brush, shaving cream and so on.  The salegirl 
handed him several small packages.  
"May I have a rubber band to put around 
them?" he asked.  The girl scowled and 
indignantly asked: Mister -- don't you 
know there's a war on?
