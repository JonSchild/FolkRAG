When I was a kid, used to be 
an old man down below Clarksdale play the
fiddle and banjo.  All them folks 'bout died out
now.  The tunes 'bout like the ring play.   Last one
I saw was 20 years ago.
His wife never danced.  Kids never did want to
go.  I'd be scared now to let 'em go Folks ac'
so bad an' crazy (Roy adds) - They chuck bottles
and pop pistols.  They used to fight a little but
not like they do now.
Used to do the Buzzard Lope  , to as fast time -
jazz - two step.

On the way back to the saloon

Brady jumped up and peeped thru a crack
The Devil throwed Brady right straddle of his back.
