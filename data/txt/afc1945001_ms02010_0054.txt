Types of Rumors
The 4,500 rumors analyzed by the Office of War Information
fall into five general classes:
a. By far the greatest number may be called "hate
rumors"; they express prejudice, animosity, or hostility 
for groups other than the enemy.
b. The second group may be classified as "anxiety
rumors"; they reflect uneasiness or fear and commonly
take the form of unfound reports of United Nations'
"disasters" or weakness, or of "overwhelming" enemy strength.
c. A third group, classifiable as "escape rumors",
reflect, in the main, wishful thinking about the progress
and duration of the war.
d. A few can be classified only as "supernatural rumors";
these contain fantastic prophecies of disaster or 
impending miracles.
e. Finally, there are a substantial number of "curiosity 
rumors" which contain amusing or novel did-bits or
supposed "news."

Hate Rumors
Besides being the most prevalent, the most dangerous
rumors are "hate rumors." The analysis of the Office of War
Information leads to the conclusion that it dangerous to print
or repeat a hate rumor, even in order to deny it. (See page 18.)
