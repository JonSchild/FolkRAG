Dear Mr. Lomax:

Following up our brief conversation in Washington early in November, I
would like to propose to you some collaboration on cowboy material. As I
understood it, you said you were very busy and that you might or might not
be in a position to cooperate with us in securing some materials for school
music use. You did say, however, that you felt your father would be in a 
position to provide us with some material.

Briefly, our problem is this. We are planning some school music books for
the elementary grades. In each book there will be a group of songs representative
of a certain locality in the United States or era. For instance,
in one of the books we will have a few Stephen Foster songs making up a unit
of study associated with the history program. In the intermediate grades
(about 5th or 6th) we shall have a group of Latin American songs to be associated
with the geography. These Latin American songs will be selected
from a group which we are going to publish in collaboration with the Pan
American Union. This pamphlet will be off the press some time early in 1942.

We shall want a group of cowboys' songs for somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or
7th grades. We do not know how many, but probably throughout the books we
could use six to a dozen. Naturally, we would like to choose from a group
of them so that we would not have duplications of anything already published.
For instance, in our books we have the following songs in different grades:

Home on the Range
Hog Drover's Song (Texas)
Old Paint
The Old Chisholm Trail
Charlie Knapp
Leather Breeches

The Dying Cowboy
The Trail To Mexico
The Zebra Dun
Little Joe, the Wrangler
Out Among the Red Men
Santa Fe Trail
Texas Cowboys' Stampede Song

If you and your father could submit a group of candidates, we would be glad
to make a choice and naturally pay for the privilege of including the songs
in the school music books. This would in no wise interfere with their use
as separate publications or in collections of your own material. The only
