Dear Alan,

I wanted to remind you that the name of that 
man up in Vermont who has such excellent stories, is 
Wallace Hayford. You can reach him through getting 
in touch with Florence or Harold Weed, East Montpelier, 
Vt. They have a phone and will be glad to cooperate. 
Florence used to fiddle for square dances and though 
not doing this work any more she might know lots of 
oldtimers. At any rate, your Vermont specialist will 
probably know the fiddler-caller of the square set team 
that won the cup at Goddard this year (the team was 
from Chelsea Corners).

Do you have Polly's address in Mexico?

I think the job on commercial records will be 
widely hailed. I'm sure there are lots of people ready 
to jump at this stuff but they don't know how to find 
it, what to listen to, etc. 

Regards,
Charles
