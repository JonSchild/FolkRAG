Thou no more wilt join our number,
     Thou no more our songs shalt know.

Dearest sister, thou hast left us,
     Here thy loss we deeply feel,
But 'tis God that hath bereft us,
     He can all our sorrows heal.

Yet again we hope to meet thee,
     When the day of life is fled,
Then in heaven with joy to greet thee,
     Where no farewell tears are shed.

Sweet rivers of redeeming love,
     Lie just before my eye,
Had I the pinions of a dove
     I'd to those regions fly.
I'd rise superior to my pain--
     With joy outstrip the wind;
I'd cross death's cold and stormy main,
     And leave the world behind.

While I'm in prison here below,
     In anguish, pain and smart,
Ofttimes those troubles I forego,
     When love surrounds my heart.
In darkest shadow of the night
     Faith mounts the upper sky,
I there behold my heart's delight,
     And would rejoice to die.

I view the monster death and smile,
     Now he has lost his sting;
Though Satan rages all the while
     I still the triumph sing;
I hold my Savior in my arms,
     And will not let Him go;
I'm so delighted with His charms
     No other good I know.
