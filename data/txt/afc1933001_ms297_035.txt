Indiana to Hold
Folklore Institute

Dr. Thompson to Direct
Summer Session—
Staff Listed.

Bloomington, Ind., May 23—
(Special)—Successful and distinguished
folklorists will come to Indiana
University June 29-Aug. 22
for the summer institute of folklore,
of which Dr. Stith Thompson
of the English department is director.

Regular credit-giving courses
will be conducted throughout the
half semester, which will serve to
introduce students to the whole
field of folklore and to train them
in research methods. There also
will be non-credit lectures and
demonstrations, round table discussions
and opportunity for private
conferences, as well as a regular
weekly series of pubic lectures.

In view of the impossibility of
covering adequately the entire
field, the institute will place its
principal emphasis on the manifestation
of tradition in tales, songs
and folk speech. The institute will
consist of the following division:
collecting of folklore, study of folklore,
enjoyment of folklore and
folklore in literature and art.

Institute will include Dr. Thompson,
director; Ralph Steele Boggs,
professor of romance languages,
University of North Carolina;
Charles F. Voegelin, associate professor
of English, Indiana University;
