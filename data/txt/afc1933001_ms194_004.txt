March 11, 1946.

Dear Duncan,

The Jelly Roll ms. which you sent me was incomplete
and, unless some ardent jitterbug has made off
with it, the complete typed manuscript is in the Archive.
However, I am a little discouraged with working at long
distance, so we will leave this problem until my forthcoming
visit to Washington--- in about ten days or two
weeks. At that time I will return to you some Jelly
Roll ms. which was sent to me in duplicate....

The attached scrawl about Jelly Roll is a music
division problem. All of the compositions mentioned in Jim
M's letter are on file [ xx ] in the music division and so I
turn the problem back to Dr. Spivacke... I guess the
enclosed from Katherine Short is also a matter for your
conscience.

The emergency ended for me about then days ago
and I am now wearing a ruptured duck--- feeling very
pleased and comfortable in civvies--- and very busy with
a number of projects so varied that I haven't really
had time to just loosen up and enjoy myself. Hope to take
a month in the sun sometime soon. Meantime, however,
expect a visit from me.

Regards,
Alan
