Four White Tunes

The Gant family in Austin, Texas, has a repertoire of about
two hundred genuine folk-songs. We only had just begun the
job of recording these tunes when we left town. The Gypsie
Laddie, The Cuckoo, the Mermaid, all English in origin, and
one fine cowboy song [is] makes the sum of their records at
present.

In Crowley, La., which is at the edge of the Acadian country
we found a most interesting cultural situation-- Cajuns, who
knew [both] English as well as French ballads , and whites of
other than French origin who knew Cajun as well as English
songs.
Two white spirituals.
Four English ballads.
Ten fiddle tunes-- the finest fiddling we have ever recorded.
Two play-party songs.
One cowboy song.
One whore house ballad.
