Richmond, Virginia
Dear Miss Blackburn:
I am enclosing herewith my report on rumors heard in the state
of Virginia over the period of August 3rd to August 15th. I 
misinterpreted your second letter of August 5th to mean that
the rumors were to be continued and the final report filed on
August 15th and that we were to supplement our report of
August 8th with an additional report extended to August 15th.
After talking with Mr. Webber on the telephone, he said to
send in a complete report as of noon of August 15th.
I am including in my report on rumors any sayings that I have
heard or that have been passed on to me. It would take a great
deal of time to substantiate or follow through on each of these
rumors, but I think it is the type of rumors in which you are
interested.
Yours very truly,
E. Leigh Stevens,
Field Representative
Bureau of Public Inquiries
