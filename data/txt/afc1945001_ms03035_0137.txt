Dr. Robert S. Gregory, 22010 Michigan Avenue, Dearborn, Mich. 

      Dearborn, Michigan.                                         Dental office.

      Dental supply salesman informs me that word is being passed
      around that the war is apt to end abruptly and at any moment. 
      This opinion is mounting and being favorably received 
      by an increasing number of people, whereas a few 
      months ago most people were being reconciled to a continuance 
      of the war for two to five years longer. Origin of 
      this opinion would be hard to trace, but similar sentiment 
      seems to be entertained abroad as well as locally.


       Dearborn, Michigan.

       Speaker at Dearborn Exchange Club talks on present meat situation, 
       explaining that 60% of government inspected packing- 
       house output is taken by the government, partly for consumption 
       by armed forces and partly for use by civilian and armed 
       forces of the Allies.

       Government only takes the hind quarters of the beef and will 
       not use shoulders and other parts of either beef or pork. 
       Regulations require leaving an inch to an inch and a half of
       fat on pork, resulting in a shortage of available lard.

       Ceiling prices are such that public is not obtaining meat because 
       cattle raisers, stock yards, packing houses, etc., have 
       to sell at a loss if they dispose of their present stock.
