[*Send Down Yo' Hand']

Send down yo' han', please send down yo' han',
Send down yo' han', please send down yo' han'
Ev'ything I tole you, [you] run an' tole yo' man.

[I'd rather be dead an' six feet in de groun']
[I'd rather be dead an' six feet in de groun']
[Than see my woman dogged aroun'.]

She look like she lookin', lookin' out' cross de sea,
She look like she lookin', lookin' way' cross de sea,
I b'lieve to my soul my gal is lookin' for me.

Don' know your troubles, they cain' be like mine,
Don' know your troubles, they cain' be like mine,
Ef I don' go crazy, hon', I'll go stone blin'.

I worked for you all summer, baby, an' part of de fall,
I worked for you all summer, baby, an' part of de fal,
Come home an' took my Chris'mas' in my overalls.

Lordy, lordy; lordy, lordy, lordy, lord,
Lordy, lordy; lordy, lordy, lordy, lord;
When I was with you, woman, you [kep(] kep' me on de holy hog. **

Ever' time I see you, you cryin' for a nickle or a dime,
Ever' time I see you, you cryin' for a nickle or dime,
Tell you to cook my dinner, you swear you ain' got time.

There's no 'way [O] o' tellin' what a woman will do,
There's no way o' tellin' what a woman will do;
I jes' wants to know, baby, what makes you do me like you do?

Give your man your [corn] biscuits, your husban' your corn-bread,
Give your man your biscuits, your husban' your corn-bread;
When he tells [to] you sumpin about it, you poke out your mouf and 
git mad.

[Go']
Go 'way f'om my window, please stay away f'om my do',
Go 'way f'om my window, please stay away f'om my do',
'Cause you know I done tole you I cain' use you no mo'.

"Goodbye, gal, an' you call that gone,
[I feel mistreated but I won't let on]
"Goodbye, gal, an' you call that gone,
I feel mistreated, Lawd, but I won' let on.
