"I would like to know the real background of these shortages we hear 
so much about. I always thought this country had more iron and copper 
than we knew what to do with. It had always before been said that 
our resources of metals were large enough to take care of us for hundreds
of years, and yet here we are abandoning plants because we can't 
get the metals for production in the plants after they are built. 
That plant in New Orleans I think cost about one-hundred million dollars 
and they couldn't be operated because of shortage of steel. What 
has happened to all the steel, or rather iron ore, we were supposed 
to have?" [*8-3 Topeka, Kan. 56*]
