LARRY:
I just think my wife ain't cool enough yet, you know. I think this thing me and her being broke up she got to you know work with those children day and night I think thats one of the worst thing happening you know she thinks, but see she brought that on herself. Do you know I had two jobs, Mrs. Davis, or didn't you know about that, I was driving a truck in the daytime I was working the very same, all for this woman, I mean I wasn't even trying to make it in the music thing. I had set that aside.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well you can forget about that now, you in this music world and you try to make the best of it, you know.
LARRY:
Oh, I'm going too. As soon as I, well everytime I go out by my wife it costs me. She had the audacity one time to tell me I only come around for myself (?) when it costs me $50, $25 everytime I go that way. I ----- get your money back. Some people just don't know what to think and they make a poor showing trying to think and shes one of them. So thats all I got to say.  Sleep all day--B. Davis sleep all day.
MRS. DAVIS:

LIONEL:

MRS. DAVIS:
