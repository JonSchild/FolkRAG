EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT                                            
OFFICE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To:               Mr. Eugene Katz                                       Date: March 31, 1942
                                                                                                   
From:          Arnold Barach     [*9B*]

Subject:       Attached Prospectus

The attached prospectus on a proposed "Serve in Silence" campaign came to me as a
result of correspondence with the Commander of the Eleventh Naval District. This
office is in no way engaged in such a campaign and, therefore, I am referring it to
you as you requested in our conversation this morning. I believe you will find the
copy of the letter attached to the front cover self-explanatory. I would appreciate
your returning the book to me at Room 2753, Temporary Building "R", 4th and Independence
S.W., in the event you do not find it suitable to your purposes. I can be reached
on Extension 6267, WPB switchboard.

I have one or wo other items in my files on the West Coast "Hush-Hush" campaign
inspired by the Navy and I shall be glad to make them available to you.
