Dear Mrs. Fineschriber:
  
           I have a lecture offer for April 9, 1941. Please
tell me what School of the Air date this falls near.
Perhaps a complete School of the Air Broadcast would
be more practical if your secretary has time to type
me a copy for me. I'm working on the bibliography
which is harder than either of us proposed.

                                            Very best regards,
               
                                                        Alan Lomax
                                                        Assistant in Charge
                                                        Archives of American Folk Songs
