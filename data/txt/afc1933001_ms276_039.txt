Unions Have A Point Everyone Can See

When you think of unions-you have to be blind, deaf, and
dumb not to these days-add them up the way some people in
a government department did here in Washington. They were
temporary clerks, and they were working hard, dreading the day
their jobs were to end, but trying to forget about it to save the
worry. Then all of a sudden, one day, when they weren't thinking 
about anything, except how much money they would have to
borrow to pay day, their assistant supervisor came in said

You're all through!

they were through. No notice of dismissal, they were to take 
their leave and be through.
