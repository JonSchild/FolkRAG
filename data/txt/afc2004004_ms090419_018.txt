says, "Now I got something to tell you I had happen to me today---"

know I was trusted that well, I didn't know I was thought that
much of a gentleman. "Say, " One of our know brethering here
says he's got to go off tonight on special business and his wife
at home by herself and he asked me to come stay with her till
he come back. So if you-all will excuse me, I would like to go
back and keep this girl company. I know she's afraid there now
by herself.

his grip and back to this boy's house he went-- and the old boy up
in the bed, [got] had put on his wife's gown and nightcap 
and he spoke real fine and [high] mincing voiced like he was a woman, "Do you
want me to light the lamp, Reverend?" [(SPEAKING IN X FINE MINCING STYLE]

"No,no,no,no, needn't light the lamp." Pulled off his
clothes and crawled up in bed, took the boy up in his arms and

he got in on. Got into his pants and walked right out the door.
Boy say, "Come back, Reverend."
