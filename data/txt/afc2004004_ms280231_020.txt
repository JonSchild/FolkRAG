Hamish: About a hundred years in some parts. But there are a lot
of parts of Scotland today in which they would sing it in company
without any trouble. If you have a farm gathering in Perthshire or
Angus or in Aberdeenshire or Kincardin, all the people together,
and after an hour or two of singing and drinking, you'd hear that
sort of stuff without any trouble.
Lomax: Women sing it as well as men here?
Hamish: Well, they mightn't sing it, but they would be there and 
they would relish it.
Lomax: Can you give a translation of the last song?
Hamish: It means. . . .Wrap the little feet of the child up in swaddlin'
clothes. I thought I was a maiden pure until I heard it crying. . . .
My daddy was a fiddler fine, my mother was a dress-maker. And I
myself, a strapping wench and danced the reel o' Stumpie - you can
imagine what that is:
Gie the Lass a Fairin':
1)  O gie the lass a fairin', lad,
O gie the lass a fairin',
Something else she'll gis to you
That's well worth the wearing.

2)  Kowp her owre among the creels,
When ye hae ta'en your brandy,
The more you bang the less she squeals,
So hey for Jock Megandey.

3)  Kowp her owre among the creels,
When ye hae ta'en your brandy,
Bar the door wi' both your heels,
The more you bang  the less she squeals.

4) O gie the lass a fairin', lad,
O gie the lass a fairin',
And she'll gie you a hairy thing
Een though it be a spare ane.

Repeat 2) and 3). . .
"Gie the lass a fairin -- give her a wage - she'll give you something
well worth the keeping. Turn her over among the creels - the
creels are the baskets for the fish - when you've ta'en your brandy -
the more you bang, the less she squeals - that's simple enough -
so hey for Jock McGandy - Good luck to it!"
