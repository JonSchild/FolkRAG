THE LIBRARY  January 14, 1940 

Dear Allen: 
Our library here has a small
sum to spend for phonograph 
records. I should like to include 
in our collection five or six 
records of cowboy music. Will
you tell me which ones to
buy and where to get them? 
I remember you well as a
youngster during my swell
weekend with your family in 
Dallas. We have followed 
your valuable folk-music 
work with sympathetic interest
and a touch of proprietary pride. 
Sincerely, 
Thomas Mayo.
