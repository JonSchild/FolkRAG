Vera Hall, reel [10] 9, page 21...
was gone to the undertaker (SIGH) So they didn't let me
know definitely, but I believed that he was dead, I believed
it. And so I said, "Doctor, I just want to ask something."
Want nobody in the room but me and the doctor. I say, "I just
want to know something. Is he bout to die? Is he nearly dead?"
He says, "He's all right." I says, "But can I go out there to
see him?" "Naw, you can't go out there now. Be quiet, Vera,
you can't go out there now. I got a shot in you now and you
got to lay quiet, so it'll take effeck." So I just lay down
there and I cried and cried and cried. And so the doctor stayed
there with me a lo-ong time and then after while another lady
over cross the street, she come over there, told her, "You
stay here with her and I'll be back out here this evenin.'" So
he went off and I ast her, "Please tell me whether my husband's 
dead or no." And she say, "Well, I'm not gon tell you no story,
Vera," say, "You just as well's as to know it now as to know
it tomorrow. He's absolutely dead." And I didn't know anything
else then till the next day. Didnknow nothin. I just fainted.
