[LEVEE CAMP BLUES]

Oh, the long line skinner gets a dollar a day,
But the short line skinner gets hell to pay.

Captain, captain, don't you think it's mighty hard
Work me all day on 'lasses and lard.

Oh, the nigger lick 'lasses, white folks lick 'em, too,
I wonder what in the world a po' Mexican's gonna do.

You know, captain, I ain't to blame,
I can't get the harness on Stavin' Chain.

He shake his head and he jump so high,
I'm 'fraid he might kick me an' I might die.

[JAIL BLUES]

[Some on the right of way, some on the farm,
Some in the chain gang, buddy, and some gone home.

I used to be a bully jest like you,
And now you see what bull'in' has brought me to.]

Wake up, lifetime man, hold up your head,
Well, you may get a pardon and you may drop dead.

Mama have told me, have come to pass,
Says, "Drinkin' an' gamblin' be your ruin at las'."

Im' lyin' in jail with my back turned to the wall,
Thinkin' 'bout my baby, I done lost it all.

If I leave here walking, captain, you'll know I'm free,
I I leave here runnin', captain, don't follow me.

If you beat me to the Brazis, to the Brazis line,
Captain, I'll be sillum seen, captain, and hard to find.

You boys listen what the captain said,
"If you work well, give you cold corn bread,
If you won't work,--will kill you dead."
