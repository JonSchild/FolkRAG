Mr. David Robinson
Rumor and Propaganda Division
Oregon State Defense Council
101 Oregon Building
Portland, Oregon

Dear Mr. Robinson:

This letter is in response to your communications of
September 26th, addressed to Mr. MacLeish, September 29th, addressed
to the Office of Facts and Figures, and October 2nd, addressed
to me.

Alan Cranston's suggestion that you communicate with
us, in the Bureau of Intelligence, is correct, since the analysis
of rumors is one of the functions of this Bureau.

We appreciate the cooperative spirit which has motivated
the foundation of the Rumor and Propaganda Division of the Oregon
State Defense Council and are sure that you people will do an excellent
job if you get off to a good start.

Towards getting off to a good start there are a good
many considerations about rumor which you and your people should
know. These we are attempting to put together in a rumor statement
incorporating the findings of the Office of War Information, for
just such groups as your own. Several copies of this will be forwarded
to you in a very few days.

Briefly, we learn from our studies of rumor that most
of them are not circulated because of Axis inspiration but are
attributable to the tensions and the anxieties of good citizens
like yourself and myself. To combat them properly it is important
to understand their causation. Because war-created anxiety produces
rumors combating each rumor individually is the equivalent
of combating the systems of the disease rather than its cause.
For this reason we are not entirely certain that newspaper publicity
in the form of sensational rumor columns is the best treatment
of this subject. Publication of rumors, even alongside their
refutation, gives them wider circulation and tends to increase the
public's feeling that the enemy is everywhere. This begets anxiety
and, of course, it is anxiety which starts rumors in the first place.
