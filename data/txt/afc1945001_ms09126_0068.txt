I heard that despite the radio announcements and 
newspaper articles, clothes were going to be rationed 
near the end of April. And that the fact that there
was a good supply of clothing was just to
keep people from hoarding.

A woman went into the grocer store and bought 10 lbs
of butter; on leaving she told the storekeeper, "I
just want to get a little butter before those hoarders get busy".
