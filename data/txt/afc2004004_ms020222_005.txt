BJ TAPE 7C, p. 3

They tell me I've a preacher,
He used to preach and pray,
We thought he had religion
Until he come to die;
You ought to heard him tell
How he made up his bed in hell;
Now I'm gonna bow on my knees
And I'll pray;
Lord, I'll bow on my knees
And I'll pray.   (CHORUS)

They tell me I've a deacon,
He used to shout and pray, etc.  (CHORUS)

Yes, since I've started out
To find me a better home, etc.
