ROI: Your Excellency?
WOOD: The negotiations have petered out with no results, Colonel Roi.
ROI: Then do I let the bombs be dropped, Your Excellency?
      Silence.
ROI: Your Excellency must decide now.
      Silence
ROI: The President gave orders.
      Silence.
WOOD: If the President gave orders, Colonel Roi, then just let the bombs be dropped.
Spread as evenly over Venus as possible.
ROI: Ready for take-off!
A VOICE: Ready for take-off, sir.
WOOD: Take me to my cabin, Mannerheim.
      Sounds of footsteps.
MANNERHEIM: Shall I fasten your seat belt Your Excellency?
WOOD: Yes, please.
MANNERHEIM: How do you feel, Your Excellency?
WOOD: Chained.
MANNERHEIM: The red light, Your Excellency. We start in twenty seconds.
      Silence.
MANNERHEIM: Ten more seconds.
WOOD: Wrecked.
MANNERHEIM: We are starting.
      Soft humming.
WOOD: Mannerheim?
MANNERHEIM: Your Excellency?
WOOD: The Russians might come and conclude a pact with them.
MANNERHEIM: Exactly.
WOOD: It is improbable really, but still possible.
MANNERHEIM: Unfortunately.
ROI: Bombs all set?
A VOICE: All set, sir.
WOOD: This possibility, however improbable it may be, forces us to drop the bombs.
ROI: Open the hatches!
A VOICE: Open, sir.
WOOD: We must be sure.
MANNERHEIM: Of course, Your Excellency.
ROI: Bombs away!
A VOICE: Away, sir.
WOOD: How high are we?
MANNERHEIM: Sixty miles.
ROI: Full speed ahead!
