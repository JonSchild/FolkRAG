Dear Moe: 

Remember, a long time ago we talked about an album of
repressings of your best old folk song records? I have been
thinking about the thing a long time, and have developed an
idea for an album of Negro songs which I think will be just
about the last word now and for the future. I felt in view
of the fact that the album would be one of repressings of
records which you'd probably own the full rights to, you could
afford in include six records in it and make it a sort of
definitive volume of the material. The titles for the album
which I suggest are six, out of which you can take your choice:

Motherless Children
Troubled in Mind
Singers of the Lonesome Road
John Henry's Children
Just Can't Keep from Cryin'
Dark Minstrels

The album is to contain the best Negro records in your
catalogs, all sung by Negro folk singers whom you have recorded
for commercial purposes, and musically I feel confident that 
it would be the most exciting folk song album yet published. 
There may be some problems in tracing all of the titles and 
discovering whether or not you have masters of them, but
even if you don't have masters, dubbings of these records would
be acceptable to ordinary listeners.
