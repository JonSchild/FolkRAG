HAITI'S ECONOMIC BONDAGE

The vote of the legislature was just
short of unanimous.
Lescot's term in office was to have
expired in January 1945.  In April
1944, the controlled legislature revised
the constitution, which it had
no legal right to do, and extended
Lescot's mandate for an additional 
seven years.  In January 1946 there
were mass demonstrations against
Lescot. Elements of the Haitian upper
class, in alliance with liberal forces,
took the initiative. Colonel Lavaud,
chief of the Guarde d'Haiti, joined
the movement against Lescot, and
Haiti's president was arrested.

Following the deposal of Lescot, who
was permitted to flee with his family
and a sizable fortune, the military
controlled the government until the
August elections. During a great part
of that period, Haiti enjoyed an interval
of relative political freedom,
as a result of which a disorganized,
confusing welter of political groups
sprang into being, most of them small,
comparatively unimportant and representing
little more than Haiti's repressed 
and immature yearnings for 
genuine independence. 

One party, however, aside from
the official group represented by president-elect
Estie, gave promise of
having some future in Haitian affairs.
This was the Popular Socialist party.
It elected the liberal Max L. Hudicourt
to the senate, and its candidate
for the presidency, Deputy Edgar
Nere Numa, showed surprising
strength.  The Popular Socialist platform
costs and salaries, full public
education, wage and hour laws, economic
and tax reforms and many
other forward-looking proposals.
The election of Estime to the
presidency leaves open to speculation
the question of whether or not
Haiti is at last to have a free and honest
government.  Estime's political
past is none too encouraging:  it is
charged that he was closely associated
with many of the corrupt practices of
the preceeding regimes, and that many
of the votes which elected him were
bought at the prevailing rate of $3000
each.  It should be noted, however,
that Estime has organized a government 
in which nearly all parties are
represented. It is still true that the
real hope of a politically and economically
free Haiti rests, not with 
Estime, but with the United States.
