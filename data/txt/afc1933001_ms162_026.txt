Dear Miss Rossell:

           A letter has gone to you c/f The American Library
Association. I've been out of town for the last three 
weeks and your letter has only recently come to my attention.
Hope you have received it by this time, and that it
came in time for your purposes.

                                                            Sincerely yours,

                                                                       Alan Lomax
                                                                       Assistant in Charge
                                                                       Archive of Amer. Folk Song
