The actual writng of the counteracting material is very
important.  While, wherever possible, official authoritative statements
by people normally responsible for the sort of material involved should
be quoted, they should only be used if their presentation is such as to
guarantee their being accepted instead of the rumor.  If necessary, it
may be wise to re-write or "ghost-write" some counteractions, always
submitting them for re-approval.  The counteractions must be colorful
and amusing, completely disarming even those who believed and spread the 
original.  A ponderous theoretical analysis, or a complicated legalistic
quotation or an answer that is obiously hedging, all should be avoided.
If the facts are not such as to warrant a clear-cut statement, they
should be withheld from the public.  This is necessary, inasmuch as rumors,
since they partake of the folk, tend to be short, concise, catchy, and the
sort of thing that the readers will accept.  If the counteraction cannot 
be of the same order or superior, the material should be withheld.

When printing a rumor, try to "deaden" it.  Preface it with a
remark which shows it to be one of a familiar class, an interesting speciman.
Don't represent a rumor as a major threat, a new item, an unfamiliar [rarity] variety .
In presenting the detail of the rumor, break up any slogans or "catchy"
phrases that carry undesirable meanings.  Be sure to place the emphasis in
reporting the rumor on the aspect which is the focus of the counteraction.

Security officers must check to be sure that the counteraction
program is not being used as a device for getting authoritative information
which may be of use to the enemy.  It might be possible for an enemy agent
to secure valuable information by asking for a denial or a rumor, when the
denial would have to include informative items.
