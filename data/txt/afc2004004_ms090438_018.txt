Fisk-16, 7ff..

The Roguish Man-Sid Hemphill, Made in 1903.

I went down to Baptis,
West come a-runnin back,
I'm gonnatell you , Bill Arstrong
Done put the ball to Jack.
My honey babe
Why don't you come home.

Old Jack walked in the house, boys,
With his pistol in his hand,
He's cussin Bill Armstrong
Like he wasn't any man,

Bill Armstrong shot Jack in the head,
Shot once on the floor,
"Tell you now, Jack,
You're arne't bull'in me no more."

Sent for Doctor Parnell,
He didn't even try---
Said, "It wasn't no use to work over Jack
For he will sholy die."

Brought Jack to his sister's
Told all his friends,
"He's been bull'in' 'round Ballantine's
Better not bully there again."

Sent for [Mister] Doctor Daniel
Dr. Blair come mighty quick,
"I'm gon tell you [I]
Jack's in a mighty bad fix."

Doctor worked on Jack
As much as we could tell,
Help of Dr. Daniel,
Jack, he got well.

Old Jack got well that time
And Jack, he wasn't sore,
Next trouble Jack got in
He broke in Mister Lawrence store.

They laid old Jack in jail that time,
He was layin on his bunk,
Studyin about the money
In Mister Castle's trunk.

He went in Mister Castle's house,
Mister Castle hadn't come back,
Jack pushed his hand in Mister Castle'strunk
Got his money sack.
