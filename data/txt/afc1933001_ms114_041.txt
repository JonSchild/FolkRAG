[*The 27th or there abouts.*]

Dear Alan and Elizabeth,
As you probably realize by now, I aint' coming to New York. At first
I thought that we would just be gone ten days or thereabouts, and I
wrote and had Sergei write me simply a masterpiece of a letter from
Aunt Anna inviting me to stay with her for ten days or so. But then
Nathan came in mind and said he hoped we'd get back in three weeks, so
that scotched everything. I am brokenhearted. It would have been the
most marvellous thing I have ever done, and I would have known so
much when I got back. Noone else could go; so we save the money to
Nathan who was starting out on two dollars.

We had a big (?) A.S.U. meeting the other day with all the other four
Asu's in Texas, and got us a State organization and a State organizer-
Nathan- and arranged a convention for next Fall. I almost wish I were
going to be here next Fall istead of gadding about so. I am just beginning 
to get over being so shy and unsure of myself, and too I
didn't know any of the procedures to be followed out, and so I retired
still further into the background.

Anyway now I am organizing a A.S.U. in Austin High School. The daughter
of the president of the Trade Unions Council, Eoldine Burroughs, is
the mainstay so far. She is really doing the organizing and getting
the kids together and runnign the whole shebang, but I still get credit
for having found her. I am simply in love with that little girl. She
is tremendously rebellious and angry at the stupidity of things as
they are taught in the High School; and now that she thinks she has
found a way out of all of the mess, she is the most excited person
I have ever seen. She just exudes enthusiasm. Kids in high school
call her a Communist too. Do you remember how mad I used to get at
the little fools in my class that greeted me so in the halls? The
things she said to me the day I went to see
