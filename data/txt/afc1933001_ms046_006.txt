Dear Dr. Payne:

It always does me good to read a letter from you. Recently I went through a lot of old correspondence and got a distinct feeling of pleasure on finding and re-reading a lot of your early letters to me when we were busy organizing the Folklore Society of Texas. That reminds me, I am sorry to say, of my attending a meeting of the Society a couple of years ago in Austin where you were called on to talk and nobody paid any attention to me. I didn't have anything to say and probably would have said badly whatever I attempted, but I did want Dobie to say, "John Lomax is here too." There is no question about Dobie's friendly feeling for me, and I suppose that he simply, honestly forgot. It is a sad feeling to realize that you're entirely out of some enterprise that you really worked hard for. Thank you for permission to use the Country song in my Cowboy book and thank you also for a copy of your article published in the Texas Folklore Volume for 1927. I am handing it on to Alan for inclusion in the Music Division of the Library of Congress. Alan, by the way, is now a permanent employee of the Library, in charge of the Folk-Song Archive.

Yours sincerely,

Honorary Consultant and Curator
Archive of American Folk Song
