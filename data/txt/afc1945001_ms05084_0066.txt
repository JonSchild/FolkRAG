GROVE CITY, Ohio – August 6, 1942.

(A hitch hiker, apparently. Clean, fairly intelligent
type) I just came from Akron. This is my fourth attempt to enlist.
Flat feet. They'll take me this time, I think, as they're not so
particular now. A fellow in Akron told me they are going to have a
U. S. Army of 15,000,000 by spring. I believe it – I saw 150 (draftees)
going from there this morning. [*70*]
