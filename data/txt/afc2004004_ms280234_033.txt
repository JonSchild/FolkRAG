Barry: You see, I went on and down to town, and then I went to
Kilkenny - that s what they call the Marble Hall - the Mrble City -
you see, there's a hall there they call it, and it's a very fine hall1/2
I can't think of the name of it now, but you se, they call it the
Marble City. And I don't know why. Many a time I've often asked why
do they call it the Marble City . One person told me they used to dig
up marble in it years ago - you know, that used to make the marble,
those marble affairs. It's a nice city. I've sung at Kilkenny, you
know. And I was knocking about and meeting different people and all
that kind of thing, but some way and another, like, although that I
met people, like, and met nice fellows there, like, good -looking
and bad-looking fellows, it never cost me a thought. Because I'll tell
you why. I was too interested in music and singing. And that is the
reason why no-one attracted me no matter how nice-looking or good-
lokking they are. Well, if he was the worst-looking men in Ireland, and
if he could get an instrument in his hand and I could look at it.......
Lomax: But there are lots of musicians in Ireland, Margaret. I don't
understand why you didn't marry a fiddler or a banjo player or a ---
there are wonderful musicians right now. I met them myself,
Good-looking ones, too, and nice ones.
Barry: You see the thing is I met a violin player one time and his
name was Jim Kearns, and he was a lovely violin player - he used to
read music, you know, and 'twas him that learned me -- at
that time, and I still can sing that yet, but not so good as that
time, like. I'd say that I might be able to sing a bit of the words
and music of it - it's an awful nice piece of music, and lovely words.
So he asked me one time, of course, would I marry him. I didn't feel
like marrying him, although he was a musician - you see, I liked him,
when he played the music for the time being. But when he let the
violin out of his hands and put it away somewhere, well then, you see,
he was standing there in front of me, I didn't like him any longer.
It's only when he had the music in the hands that I liked him. But
when the music was gone, my taste fell completely.
Lomax: But you didn't feel the same way about your husband.
Barry: You see, my husband, you see, when I went to Kilkenny, you
see, singing, you know, well, I wasn't doing too much of it - I was
always able to get a living, you see. I always got money. And I just
got this bit of money here and there that kept me going, and that was
all that mattered to me. I didn't want to be a millionaire or anything
like that, I just wanted enough to keep me going so that i
wouldn't be going around that night and going to places, 'cause I
liked to enjoy myself, you know, and I mean to say, I didn't want to
keep myself backwayds. you know, because I was nice at the stage,
you know. Well, I went to a little place called Kellen in the
County Kilkenny. I sung there, you know. I met my husband there. 
So he invited me up to the house. His sister was there and hus brother
was there.
Lomax: What did he look like to you then ?
