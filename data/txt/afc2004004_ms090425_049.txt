Settin Down

I wishx I was in heaven, settin down, settin down,  
I wishx I was in heaven, setting down. 
I wishx I was in heaven---O yes! O yes!
I wish I was In heaven, settin down. 

In heaven I wouldn' have nothin a-tall to do, 'tall to do, 
In heaven I wouldn' have nothin a-tall to do, 
Jes set down and rest--- O yes! O yes! 
In heaven I wouldn' have nothin a-tall to do. 

I'd walk about in Heaven and tell the news, etc...

I'm gonna tell God how you treat me, when I get home. 
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me, when I get home, 
Tell God how you treat me, --- O yes! Oh yes! 
I'm gonna tell God how you treat me when I get home.
