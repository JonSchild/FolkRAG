3) And with a shroud of rope I beated him,
Most shamefully, I can't deny,
And with a marling-spike I gagged him
Because I didn't like to hear the poor boy cry.
4) Now my crew, they do object to me,
Seeing as how I done wrong,
Down in my cabin close confined me
And took me to London in irons strong.
5) Now my trials they do come on to me,
In Newgate Jail I'm condemned for to die,
If by my crew I had taken warning,
I might have saved that poor boy's life and my own.

None Ever Loved as I:
1) As I walked forth one summer's day to view the meadows green & gay,
A pleasant bower I espied standing fast by the river-side,
And there a maiden I heard cry, "Alas, alas, none ever loved as I."
2) Then round the meadow she did walk gathering each flower by the stalk
Such flowers as in the meadow grew, the deadman's thumb, the herb all blue.
And as she pulled them still cried she, "Alas, alas, etc. ."
3) When she had filled her apron full of such green things as she could cull,
The green leaves served her for a bed, the flowers were pillows for her head,
Then down she laid, ne'er more did speak,
Alas, Alas, with love her heart did break.

As I Was A-walking:
1) As I was a-walking down by the seashore,
Where the winds they do howl and the waves they do roar,
I met a young maiden outstretched on the ground,
And she was s-making a most melancholy sound.
Chorus:
Give us way, oh, oh my adored,
I will never, never, never,
No never, ever ever
See thee no more.
2) She'd the form of the sylph & the voice of a dove,
And the words she was warbling concerning of love,
When I asked her to marry me, my true love to be,
She said, "Oh dear no, he lies under the sea."
