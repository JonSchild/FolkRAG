LIST OF AMERICAN FOLK SONGS ON COMMERCIAL RECORDS
Compiled by Alan Lomax.

After listening to [some] three thousand[s] odd commercial records
of white and Negro songs and tunes from the South, I have compiled this
list of three hundred and fifty representative titles in order that the
interested musician or student of American society may explore this
unknown body of Americana with readiness. [[?]]The choices
have been personal and have been made for all sorts of reasons. Some of the
records are interesting for their complete authenticity of perfromance;
some for their melodies; some because they included texts of important or
representative songs; some because they represented typical contemporary
deviations from rural singing and playing styles of fifty years ago;
some to make the list [[???]]as nearly
as possible typical of the material I examined. [[?]]I feel sure that I have
heard only a quarter of the [good] interesting records; for example I was 
able [noweher] nowhere to find a large group of [[???]]Okehs or Gennet[?]s
to audition. Many records have been passed over because at times the
auditioning process has had to be hurried. But I have come away from this
listening experience with the certainty that American folk [song] music,
while certain folk-lore specialists have been mourning its decline,
has been growing in new directions [in competition]to compete with "thick" commercial 
music,
and that it is [[??]]today in[i] its most "distorted" form
in a helthier condition, roving the radio stat[t]ions and recording studios than
it [will] has been or ever will be in the notebooks of collectors. No better
indication of this can be found than in the scores of contemporary ballads
and songs, some of them songs of protest, that can be found in this list.
Many of these records are out of print. It seems to be impossible
in the present state of confusion that exists in the files of commercial
recording companies to say which records are in print and which are not.
As a general rule the most modern records are the easiest to obtain. [*I
will deeply appreciate any suggestions for or additions
to this preliminary list.*]
