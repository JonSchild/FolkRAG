Time Code:  Tape: [894] 894 cont. Nimrod Workman  5

AL: She goes hunting in the woods at 86?
Nimrod: I'm 87, and I'm going in a few days now, if they
don't call me off singing. I haven't had time. Last
year, I took about $700 off a gin sing. I went back out to
the Trench(?) Mountains, I went up into West Virginia......(?)
there was an old man who fell dead back in there, well, he
wasn't no old man, he was about 57 years old. Went back in
there and took a heart attack. Rough mountains. I went
right back in there and sang all over that thing......
AL: Your grandmother lived to be....
Nimrod: 117. And that morning she got up and cooked
breakfast. My grandmother, Rebecca Jewel, and if people
don't think she's that old, they can go right back to
W. Virginea, Willliams, WVA, and go to the newspaperoffice
and they'll have an old copy of it. Her picture's in it,
holding flowers up in her hand, Rebecca Jewel, 117, oldest
woman in the state of West Virginia. Her picture. And
she got breakfast that morning....went and laid down in
the bed, and when she was talking about it, she said, if I
have an enemy in this world, it's more than I know about.
And now I have to leave you all. And the next thing, I went
out of there and went back in and she was dead. Just died,
went all the way easy. Well my daddy, we took him home, he
couldn't walk, he was old. He told my wife, he said, I'd
like to have some milk,sweet milk, fresh milk. Well, I was
doing the milking, had my own cow. I'd milk it, she said put
