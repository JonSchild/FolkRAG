August 6 - The next comment came from a Judge of the State Supreme
Court in Lincoln, and it was considered worth passing along in this report,
because it was a splendid point of view: He said, "Our constitution gives us
our freedom of press, freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but in time of
a crisis, these freedoms should yield to the Government." My friend, who was
also present and heard the Judge's remark, said: "I never thought of it in just
that light, but how right the Judge is in that though, because we accept and
exercise these freedoms and quickly challenge the right of any one to take them
away, yet without our Government they would be no good, therefore, we should
consider its safety first. That's just why all these conflicting statements
coming out of Washington through press and radio should be eliminated. People
are getting so they don't know what to believe, and so many have just quit
listening and reading because they have no fait in any of the news sources." [*13*]
