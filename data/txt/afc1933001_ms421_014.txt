CONSUMERS WILL CO-OPERATE
Tune: Good Night Ladies.
(Ladies may substitute the word brothers.)

Good news ladies!  Good news Ladies!
          Good news ladies!
     Consumers will co-operate.
Happily we join each other, join each other
          join each other,
Happily we join each other,
     To co-operate.

Rejoice ye ladies!  Rejoice ye ladies!
          Rejoice ye ladies!
     Consumers will co-operate.
Differences will fade away, fade away,
          fade away,
Differences will fade away,
     When we co-operate.

Hip hurrah ladies!  Hip hurrah ladies!
          Hip hurrah ladies!
     Consumers will co-operate.
Joyously we work for the other, work for the
          other, work for the other,
Joyously we work for the other,
     We'll always co-operate.
                                                        C. W. K

CONSUMERS WILL SHINE
Tune: Our boys will shine tonight.

Consumers will shine tonight, Consumers will
          shine,
They'll shine in honor bright,
     All down the line.
Don't we look fine tonight, don't we look fine,
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
Consumers will shine

Consumers are here to build, consumers are here,
They[8]'re here to right the way,
     All down the line.
That's what we're here to do, let's do it right,
When our minds think straight and our wills come
          clean,
Consumers will build.
                                                       C. W. K
