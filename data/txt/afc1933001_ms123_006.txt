Mme. Suzanne Sylvain
Port-au-Prince
Haiti

Dear. Mme. Sylvain:

     First, I want to thank you for the favor you did me by
writing Le Creole Haitien. It proved a very useful book to
a collector who arriving in Port-au-Prince and was expected
to record Creole folk-songs without any knowledge of Creole
or of French either.

     Then I want to express my sorrow that I was forced to
return to the United States before you return from Paris.
I had met your two charming sisters and had been entertained
at Kenscoff by your hospitable brother, and they had prepared
me for meeting a very delightful person. My wife and I were
sorely disappointed when we learned that you had stopped over
in New York.

     Dr. Herzog told me the other day that the American Folk-
Lore Society plans to issue your volume of Haitien folk-tales
in Creole and I eagerly await its publication, In the meantine,
however, I should like to know where the Library can
purchase the thesis that you published in French, I believe,
on Haitian folk-tales. I would be very grateful to you if
you would send me the name of the book and the publisher.

     Please give my kindest regards to your two sisters and
to Pierre. 

Sincerely yous,

AL:ep
