[*the vision*]
First looked liek a picture near bout, when she first
started scernin it, it look like a pichur frame. But it
come just a little bit plainer or something. It was face.
She wondered and wondxred and womdered (VERA SOUNDS AWFULLY
INSINCERE ALL THROUGH HERE) Lord what in the world can that be
that's so far up yonder. And said that she'd wipe her eyes and
she'd just do ever way tryin' to see plainer and plainer.
And said that something told her that that was Jesus. and she
said that the face was a white face and had a little beard
hang down under the chin and hair on the head. Said she could see
it plain enough to see that. now she's one that says she
saw something like that. but I never have saw it. Just something
told her that was Jesus...
A: Vera why do you suppose there's so much trouble and sorrow and
pain and sickness and people going without food and education

to do these things---and he say if you make one step yowards
me I'll make two---and I reckon those kind of people that suffer
for everything, just out of really things that they need, sich
as food that they have to have, you kin promise yuh back but you
must eat , you got to eat---you kin wear just any kind of blothes
but you've go to eat evy day---they just ain't makin they step
