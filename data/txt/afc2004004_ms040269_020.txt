YOUNG FIMMY FOYER
1
Far distant, far distant, lies Scotia the brave
No tombstone memorial to hallow his grave
His bones are now scattered in the rude soil of Spain
And young Jimmy Foyer in battle was slain
2
From the Perthshire militia to serve in the line
the brave Forty Second we sailed to join
For Wellington's army we did volunteer
Along with young Foyers that brave halberdier
3
That night when we landed the bugle did sound
The general gave orders to form on the ground
To storm Burgess Castle before break of day
And young Jimmy Foyers to lead us the way
4
When mounting the ladder to scaling the wall
A shot from a french gun young Foyers did fall
He leaned his right arm across his left breast
And young Jimmy Foyers his comrades addressed.
5.
"To you Robert Pirrie that stands on campain
If guid luck should guide you to Scotland again
Ye may tell my auld mither nae mair for to murn
For her son Jimmy Foyers will never return
6
"But if I had a drink o'Baker Brown's well
My thirst it would quench and my fever would quell"
But life's purple current was ebbing so fast
That young Jimmy Foyers soon breathed his last
7
They took for a winding sheet his bonny tartan plaid
And in the cold grave his poor body they laid
With hearts full of sorrow they covered the clay
And murmuring "Young Foyers" marched slowly away
8
The bugles may sound and the war drums may rattle
They will never arouse this young hero to battle
He fell from the ladder a soldier so brave
And young Jimmy Foyers now lies in his grave
