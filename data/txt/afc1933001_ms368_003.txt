evening [our] this rural man of the theatre and his troup came with 
their belled shepherd staves and sang for our recording machine. Three 
of their songs you will find in this book.

In Brownsville Manuela Longorio, principal of a Mexican school, 
sang for us songs which she had learned from her grandmother. In Brownesville, 
too, we recorded the ballads of Blind Jos√© Saurez, the [teen] 
minstrel. [His cane has guided him] He has been blind since childhood, 
but his cane [q] guides him everywhere through the city, to bars, to dances, to 
family parties and everywhere his guitar and his ballads make him 
welcome. He says that he does not know how many songs he can sing, since 
new ones come into his mind[s] every day that he has not thought of in 
years. He knows all the popular songs of the day, all the old border ballads, 
and, whenever anything of excitement and import occurs, he makes a new 
historia for the information of his people. His songs concern the bandits 
of the border country, the troubles of the migratory cotton pickers, 
the disasters of train wrecks, storms and wars and the pleasures of 
mescal.

These songs and these singers have deep roots in this country 
of South Texas, tough roots that run deep and straight down into the 
earth, like the roots of the mexquite and cactus. I once asked a huge 
laughing Mexican who played a small mandolin how he would explain 
to a foreigner [why he loved his hot, dusty] his immense love for his 
hot, dusty, thin-soiled South Texas farm. My friend became serious. 
"I would tell him first," he said "About the so poisonous rattlesnakes 
and moccasins. Then I would tell him about how many marvellous thorns 
we have, thorns on everything. Then......"

[These songs were recorded through the courtesy of many kind and 
patient people in South Texas  Most of the see all the records are
made by Juba is Lazz Mr. and Mrs. John A. Lomax]

All the songs in this book were recorded by John A. Lomax, Curator 
of the Archive of American Folk Song, for the Music Division of the 
Library of Congress. In his behalfand that of the Library I wish to 
thank Frank Goodwyn, Richie Dobie, Jim K. Wells and many other 
South Texans who made the field work easy and [plas] pleasant.
