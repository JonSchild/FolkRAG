Yes, I'm telling you they'd put them in the markets sometime and of course they would run away, as I before stated. So the thirty days didn't mean anything. Of course, it [New Orleans] was a free and easy place. Everybody got along just the same and that's the way it was. 

There wasn't no certain neighborhood for nobody to live in, only for the St. Charles Ave. district, which is considered the millionaire's district, in fact, it was. And that's how it was, when anybody went any place that they wanted. Many times you would see some of those St. Charles Ave. bunch right in those honky tonks. They was around. They called themselves slumming, I guess, but they was there just the same, nudging elbows with all the big bums. And I'll go so far to say that some of them were even lousy. You would meet many times with some of those fellows that was on the levee, such as the inferior longshoremens, long - what is it? Longshoremen. Is that right? And screwmens. And many of them, I would doubt, that there were very unclean. Some of them were even lousy, I believe. I know many cases where they would take a louse and throw on another guy that was dressed up to get him in the same fix that they were in. Aw, it was a funny situation. 
Question: Do you remember any of the stuff that they sang?
Morton: On the levee? Well, they used to sing something - 

I'm a levee man, I'm a levee man,
I'm a levee man, Yes, I'm a levee man.

I said, "Captain, captain, Let me make this trip."
I said, "Captain, captain, Let me make this trip."

If you do, captain, I will get my grip.
If you do, my captain, Let me go home and get my grip."
