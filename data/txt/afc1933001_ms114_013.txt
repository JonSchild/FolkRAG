Dearest Deanie & Father -

No news as yet - the trip
started I have reason to 
believe sometime last Wed.
Thanks for mail & check.
Am anxious for [?]
bank statement. In bed
today from too much sun
on the beach yesterday
children fine & brown
mother droopy & red!
Surely appreciate letters
from you both. Will
write as soon as anything
happens - too low in
spirit now to try.
Lovingly,
Shirley.
