thing, ya got... See, she had a big butter moulder, too, ya know.
An' um, a course, that's them things, they mould it to make
it look pretty, or whatnot, ya see?  But, anyhow, you could
take your moulder an' mash it, ya know, an be sure that all the
water is outa it that you [can] kin get out.  An' yet, ya haven't got
it out, ya see.  Ya got all ya kin git out of it.  An' they you,
ah, put the butter on a slow fire, jus' very slow, you know.  Not
enough to burn it, but it's quick to burn.  Ya put it on a slow
fire an' jus' let it jus' simmer there, jus' simber (sic), until...
An' hit won't even turn brown or nothing, ya know.  An' they...
If ya put it in -- Like ya put it in these lil' ol' tin things,
quite natchully, [it'll burn] it will, ya know.  But, you see... You can put

enough.  Have the jar hot, already hot.  An' jus' like you [go'] gon'
can[e] sumpthing, you know, an' you put it in, in there an' stopper
it up.  Fasten it up.
     An' she's there, for years an' years.  It's
jist like the butter you buy from the store.  Good an' fresh an'
