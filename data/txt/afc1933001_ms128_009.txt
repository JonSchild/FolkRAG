Mr. Paul G. Brewster
618 S. Fess Avenue
Bloomington, Indiana

Dear Mr. Brewster:

This is in answer to your letter of December 11, addressed
to Mr. Alan Lomax who is still in bed recovering from a bad case
of pneumonia.

Your suggestion that Mr. Lomax do some recording in Indiana
next summer is a very interesting one and will receive very
serious consideration. Our plans for next spring and summer are
still in the making but we have discussed tentatively the possibility
of a midwestern trip. Will you please keep in touch with
us and let us know if you succeed in getting the grant? If we
can cooperate on such a project, I am sure that we shall be able
to work out terms (duplicate records, etc.) which you will find
satisfactory.

Yours truly,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
