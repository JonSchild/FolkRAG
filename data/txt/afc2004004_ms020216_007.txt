BJ TAPE 3, p.5

AL:   It seemed like he came right in the room with you?
 
BJ:   Tha's right. He jus' reached right in, right to the foot of the bed.

AL:   Just like the real thing right there before you.

BJ:   Tha's, tha's right. Just like it was. An' so I wa'n', 
I wa'n' afraid.  'Cause I was just in this slumber. I couldn't 
get afraid; I ain' afraid yet.  I never, never had a fear, a fear 
about it. But I jus' know he came.
       And then I went and told diffrunt ones about it in, in the 
place there, where it was. . .Oh yes!  An' then, that was it. I 
knew then.  But that was what was to come.  That was - He, he showed me three 
churches.  An' these three churches, an' each one had a tem -- 
a steeple, you know, to it, except one.  This third one didn't 
have no steeple to it at all, jus' a plain church.  And it had 
underneath it, right at the bottom an' at the top, "Holy."  An' 
I didn't know anything, nothin', I jus' know I had. . .

AL:   You think he was really callin' you to the Holiness Church?

BJ:    That, that when I called to the Holiness an' I didn't know 
it; but I didn't know then.  I thought I had what I had with me right 
there.  'Cause I was prayin' to get with it, you know, stayin'? 
I didn't know.

AL:    Was there a Holiness Church in your. . .?

BJ:    No, there wa'n', not in that neighborhood, nowhere around 
there. Nowhere.

AL:   The folks hadn't heard about the Holiness?

BJ:    Ye-s, a few.  You know, most -- around Fitzgerald, all around 
there -- oh, yeah.  Been a whole lot. But I didn' know that was 
it.  Tha's jus' what I was at right then.  Satan just' led me 
jus' this way, see?  This is it now.  See, Satan is wich ya at
