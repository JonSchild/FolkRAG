Hitler says, Negroes look like monkeys and apes

one white soldier and two Negroe soldiers were 
held in a Jap prison. The white soldier was released
first, when asked how he got out so quickly
he said, "the gaurd let us out for 4.00, I paid
mine, and the two Negroe soldiers said, 'I'll
pay you Saturday."
