THE END for the time-being. Remember to send me a postcard 
whether you want to buy anything or not. Otherwise you won't
receive future lists of records, both used and unused, which 
I have on hand at the moment and am finding all the time.

If possible include a list of your wants, specific or
general. No obligation to buy, of course.
If you're interested in blues on such race labels 
as OKeh, Columbia, Paramount, let me know. I can supply
a large number of them by Clara Smith, Ethel Waters,
Victoria Spivey, Lonnie Johnson, et al, et al. All new,
virgin-fresh discs, too.
