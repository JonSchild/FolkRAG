the hands of the enemy instead of suggesting that rumors are invented and circulated
by the enemy. The rumors which play into the hands of the enemy are those
which spread hatred or suspicion among ourselves and which encourage defeatism or
despair.
Some rumors contain verifiable facts and cannot be denied without revealing facts which
must remain unpublished temporarily for reasons of military security. Rumor-control
groups can urge newspaper which print the information, after enough time
has elapsed, to emphasize why the facts had to remain unpublished and why the
rumors had to remain unchallenged. Rumor-control groups can impress their communities
with the fact that something known to hundreds of people is not necessarily
known to thousands of people; and that the repetition of rumors--even those
based upon a fact known to the rumor-teller--makes it easier for the enemy to obtain
military information.
Direct Denial of Rumors
While the major responsibility of a rumor-control project is to fill information
gaps and to conduct an educational campaign in careful thinking, it sometimes
becomes necessary to refute specific rumors with specific information. This involves
many dangers, since it means giving publicity to the rumor in an attempt
to eliminate it. Unless the rumor and its denial are presented with great care,
much more harm than good may result. The experience and surveys of the Office
of War Information lead to the following recommendations.
1. The stating of a rumor and its denial should only be attempted in print;
never over the radio.
2. In general, deny only those rumors which can be denied flatly and conclusively.
