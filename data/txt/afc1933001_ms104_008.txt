Dear Mr. Lomax:

Since I failed to see you at the Chamber of Commerce office
this morning, I shall advise you in this manner, that I
called Mrs. McNeil, daughter with whom Mr. Campbell, old
T rail Driver, of whom I told you lives, and she said that
her father would appreciate and enjoy a visit with you,
should you find time to call.

[* Did not reach *]

Although Mr. Campbell is ninety years old, he is in fairly good
health and I believe he would be able to make some contribution
of value and that you would find a visit with him worthwhile.

Mr. Campbell lives at 602 East Huisache, with Mrs. A. G. McNeil
Telphone, 276-J.

It would be convenient most any time that you would have,
for you to call, I feel sure.

Sincerely yours,
