July 9, 1942

Dear Madam Comhaire,

I have tentatively discussed your Creole with the 
Rosenwald people and I shall incorporate it into my
plan to be submitted to them early in the fall. At that
time I'll probably want to have more detail than your
letter of June 27 quoted me. I'll be back in Washington
by the time you've finished with your work at Columbia
and it will give me great pleasure to see you again at
that time. I'll do my best to protect you from the savages
in civilized garbs.

With my kindest regards,
