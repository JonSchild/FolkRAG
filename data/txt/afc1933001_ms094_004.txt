My Dear Mr. Lomax- 
(A.M. 1907) When 
I was feeling rather low 
for various reasons I 
opened up the last 
Harvard Alumni Bulletin 
& spotted your article one 
Dean Briggs - 
When I was in Cambridge 
the Dean was in his 
prime and he was the 
one I most respected. 
Your perfect description 
of him would draw an 
English A plus - It
braced me up. I thank you. 
Sincerely yours, 
Arthur H. Damon1904 
(too many erases in mine
but then-)
