Dear Alan: My sincere apologies
for such frequent, justifiably annoying
letters.

1. I very much need for my
book of adventures a copy of the words of Rev.
Senkeller Griffen's sermon. Also the
words of [any] other Negro sermon 
which either of us recorded
Some I know have been copied.
2. Please also send me all
the unused material from 
Our Singing Country in particular
the left [under] over introductory
material for individual songs,
Chapters or the back story. This
request does not apply to
any of your personal writing
