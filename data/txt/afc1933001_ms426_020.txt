Tune: There Are Smiles That Make Us Happy.

There's a cause that makes us happy,
There's a cause to which we're true,
There's a cause that steals away our troubles,
Like the sunbeam steals away the  dew,
There's a cause that has the deepest meaning,
To the farmers and the farmers' wives,
It's the cause we call the Farmers' Union,
And to it we give our lives.

There are men who are courageous,
There are men so courtly too,
There are men who fight for their convictions,
Like the statesmen and our soldiers do,
There are men who stir our admiration,
Men of might and men of courage cold,
80
But the men who fill our hearts with gladness
Are the men of the Union bold.

There's a band that is so loyal,
There's a band that is so true,
There's a band that smiles away the teardrops,
Just as sturdy women ought to do;
There's a band that has a steady purpose,
Which the eyes of everyone can see,
They are standing by the Farmers' Union,
They're the Women's Auxiliary.


FARMER'S FAREWELL
Tune: How Can I Leave Thee.

How can I leave thee, how can I from thee part?
Thou only has my heart, dear farm believe.
Thou hast this soul of mine, so closely bound to thine,
No other can I love save thee alone.

Would I a bird were, soon at thy side to be,
Falcon nor hawk would fear, speeding to thee.
When by the grafter slain, I at they feet should lay,
Thou sadly would complain, joyful I die.

Blue is the flower, called the forget-me-not.
Grow it upon thy heart and think of me.
Floweret and hope may die but love with us stall stay,
That cannot pass away-dear farm believe.
