Dear Mr. Moore: 

When I was in Florida and southern Georgia in the 
summer 1935, the work 'jouk' was current as applied to a dance
hall and drinking place of 'low resort'. I heard this term 
used mostly by Negroes and used in exactly the same sense as 
barrel-house was used in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The 
word was also used as a verb, applied to a certain style of 
guitar playing in which the player, using a pattern of bass runs, 
played the melody on the tenor strings with a bottle neck on his 
little finger, Hawaiian fashion. They would say "jouk it boy",
or "I'm jouking it now", and the style of playing itself was called 
"jouking".  Zora Neale Hurston uses the word constantly in "Mules
and Men" abd she can undoubtedly give you a great deal more information. 
She can be reached through her publishers, Lippincott Co., 
Phil. Penna. "Jouk box" I've heard only recently and I feel as 
though it has been derived from generic 'jouk'. I suggest, also, 
that you contact Sterling Brown, Howard University, English Department
about this. 

I've been in contact with _______________ University of Georgia
in regard to starting a Folklore Archive there.  Are you interested 
in this enterprise? 

Cordially yours,
