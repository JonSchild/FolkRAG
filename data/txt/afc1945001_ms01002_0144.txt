One well-known rumor column started its masthead with 
the following: "Some of the most dangerous, false, rumors now

might otherwise seem to give the lie to the answer. Notice that 
it does not feel the need to give the official source of the in-
formation, but relies, rather, upon the confidence the people have 
in the column and the newspaper for a fair report.

Khaki belong to maritime regiments and are
