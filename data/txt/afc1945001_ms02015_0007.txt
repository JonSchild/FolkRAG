PUBLIC OPINION INTERVIEW IN DALLAS, TEXAS

January, 1942

More than 100 interview cards were received from Dallas. In
many cases the statements recorded had no bearing or relevancy to O.P.A.
matters; no cognizance was taken of these cases.

The general reaction to price control was favorable; 58 out
of 77 individuals were definitely in favor of O.P.A. This group included
people of all types––grocers, barbers, porters, professional men, etc.
9 out of the 77 were definitely against price control. This group was
comprised of lawyers, traveling salesman, proprietors of small businesses,
etc., and their reasons fall into 2 general categories. One group composed
of those against the New Deal and everything that it does; the other,
those who misunderstood the objective of price control. A typical example
is a male attorney over the age of 45, who said:

"Price control is in the same group as other New Deal agencies,
grafts for new deal politicians to keep their henchmen employed."

Three out of the 77 had no comment to make; 2 had O.P.A. confused
with other defense agencies, notably O.P.M.; 5 persons had never
heard of O.P.A. or any attempt to control prices. The occupations of these
people are as follows: housewife, salesman, laborer, clerk, special officer
in bank. Some typical comments are:

"Did not know anything about price bill as he never reads the
paper and seldom listens to the radio."

"Thought prices should be kept from going too high but not
aware of existence of O.P.A."

There were comparatively few comments on rationing. In the
case of tire rationing, all comments were favorable. The great majority
