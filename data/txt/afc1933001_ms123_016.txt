Dear Alan:

Our SoundScriber Junior operates from AC current and we
can furnish a gasoline engine for $80.00 which will also furnish
60 cycle AC current for it. The gas engine is simple, and, while it
is not quiet enough to operate it near the microphone, it can be
in the next room, in a car, etc.

These recorders are priced low due to increased production
on them but there is no margin to allow for trade-ins. The price
of $285 is strictly net. It includes the machine complete with
an Astatic crytal microphone of the duo-diaphragm type and the
recording quality is very good, and is the equal of most of the
competitive machines of the $500 class.

There is a jack for listening to the microphone or whatever 
else passes through the amplifier. Coupling into radio differs
with every type of radio but it may be done by pulling out the
microphone and plugging in a suitable coupling device. We can furnish
suitable coupling if given the name and model of the radio
and some information as to where you are to cut into the radio
to couple in.

The machine records on acetate or aluminum and is usually
furnished for inside-out cutting and with a feed of 100 lines per inch

I expect to go to Washington again within the next month
and possibly either the last week of July or first week of August.
If you are to be there then, I shall be glad to demonstrate one
of them to you.

Sincerely yours,
Lincoln Thompson
