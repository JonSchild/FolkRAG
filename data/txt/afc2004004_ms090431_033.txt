Fisk, 1[2]1. 9
B: Oh most any little tale you be thinkin about.  Sometime why you
be thinking about a little boy, one time.  He went off and after he
went off singing there.  He kept on to his poppa, jee-ing you know.
He co[j]me back running to play with him all the time.  "Come on,"
he s[y]ay.  "I got a new one on you today." He say, "What's that son?"
He say, "We gonna play train today."  "Son, I don't know how to
play train."  "Momma, I show you."  "All right, son, I'm ready."
Say, "What you mean, ready.  That means to back up."  Say, "What you
mean, say back up?"  "That mean go head a little bit; That mean
you couple up good."  She went ahead a little bit to see if she
coupled up good. Then he say, "High ball."  "Son, what you mean
by that?"  "That means to toot-toot."  "What you mean there, son?"
"Get your black ass out of town."  (laughter)
A: Wel, you all keep on laughin and talkin and joreeing all day 
long or does that come at some point in the day?
B: That some time.  Well now, you take pract8cly if it's real hot,
prac8cly don't nobody want no talk.  If a man is working real hot, you 
don't hardly hear nothin but the caller if you're laying steel or
something like that.  But if it ain't real hot, why, you hear laughin
and jolly crackin all day long.  Mighty few days you go out and don't
hear nothin,  and then they work hard in a day's work, it would be
miserable.
A: But some people and like that, and some people don't.
B: Some people go out and don't never say nothin.  Now we has one
man, one or two, I tell, why, maybe if you say something to them, why,
maybe the turn you out and maybe not.  You just continue going and
doin what they do all day long, but that's just stay awake.  But where
you find one or two of em, why, maybe you don't say something right 
away fast. Pract8ly eve[y]rybody say something, and we talk lively.
A: The bo[dd]ss doesnt mind.
B: The boos, he don't mind, cause he know that if nobody say nothin,
