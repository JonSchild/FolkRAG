Dear Mrs. Smith:

   I had the great pleasure of viewing the films
taken on your recent expeditions to Martinque and the Surinam,
last week at Mr. Leigh's invitation.  I am hoping to have some
of them here at the Museum on our course for members.  They were
rarely beautiful.

   I had heard that you intended recording native
music, and so was pleased when Mr. Tuttell told me you had brought
back recordings from Dutch Guiana.  Since I have been arranging
programs to correlate with various museum halls for the past two
years, I am always interested in such recordings, which are not
easy to find.  I am wondering if you plan to put these on the
market as Mrs. Laura Boulton has done with her recordings of African
and North American Indian music.  I use her albums (with very helpful
notes) in my hall programs, giving credit to her of course.  I hope
it will be possible for you to make some such use of your recordings.
I had considerable difficulty in making up a program for our South
American Hall, which I have used only once, but over a two week period.

   I am enclosing a few of these programs in case you may
be interested in this work, and shall hope that you will call on me
some time when you are in New  York City.

Sincerely yours,

(sigmed) Hazel L. Muller

These programs were distributed free to all visitors who attended the
music programs.  Perhaps you know that we have a sound system installed
throughout the Museum.
