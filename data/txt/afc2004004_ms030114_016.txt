J. Fenton     -5-
     Gary recorded in N.Y. and then was not torecord again
till 1949.  Just why Perfect and J.B. Long never took him back
to the studio is unclear, but it seems that he an Long had a 
large disagreemen Gary said the following in Blues Unlimited,
nov. 1966, "J.B. Long, That man went crazy, lost his mind and
everything he had.  He didn't do me right, you know, he didn't
give me but fifty dollars a timr the first time I came, he kept
the royalties.  In them days I thought fifty dollars was some
money."
     While traveling an playing on the streets of RAliegh, N.C.
Gary passed ANie Wright's house, and her sister invited Gary
in.  He and ANnie started seiin each other and a year after they
were engaged, they were married (it is quite possible that
they were never actually married, as Annie one confessed to
Alan Smithline and John Doer that they were never actually
married.  Probably Gary and /or Annie had never legally divorced
their old spouses)  Gary moved to Raleigh and possibly a year
later they moved to N.Y.C., were Annie's two daughters were
living.  Annie went first, possibly just to visit, and then Gary
followed a week later with the help of Travelers Aid.
     In N.Y. ANnie was working as a domestic in Mamaroneck
N.Y. and then they moved to Brooklyn and then finally the
East Bronx.  Gary played on the corner of 137 Street in Harlem
as well as on the subways, with a cup attached to his shoulder
and his guitar in hand.
