Dear Mr. Lomax;
I am sorry to have delayed answering your letter but
I have just returned from my vacation and haven't
really been responsible since.
I wish to say I shall be more than glad to do
every thing I can to make your visit both profitable
and pleasant.
We are planning on having an agricultural and school
fair at Frenchburg on the 29th of October, at which time
we hope to have an old time Fiddler's Contest.
We should be glad to turn this part of the program over
to you if you can arrange your schedule in such a way
as to be here that day.
If, in the meantime, there is anything I can do to assist you,
I shall be glad to do so.
Very truly yours,
Shelby Kash
