Dear Alan: Thank you for the
catalogue of folk songs which
has just come. Before I work out
a list will you please ask Mr
Spivacke if he can still keep his promise?
I think some of the items of
the poems on Miss Vinson's list
are quite rare. She would
I think I think send the words to
you if you asked for them.
I've checked them for you. Should
I ever go to Oklahoma I plan
to see her.

I again apologize for sending
you notes so often. A day does not
pass in which something does not
come up which it seems properly
belongs to you. J.A.L.
