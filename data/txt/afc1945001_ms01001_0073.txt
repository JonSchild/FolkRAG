else just won't try to pay them?  (Iowa)
The least frequent rumors are the wish rumors.  These rumors
reflect the personality characteristics of an individual who when confronted
with a grim reality denies it by distorting it as if seeing it
through rose-colored glasses.  [Just as] T[t]he anxiety rumors reflect a
distortion in the direction of an exaggerated problem; the wish rumors
distort, but choose another direction.  Some illustrations of this type
of rumor are the following:

Warehouses are full of sugar, so why should it be
rationed?  (Minneapolis, Minnesota)

There is no shortage of meat in this country.  We have
more cattle and hogs than ever before in our history.
(Tennessee)

Lloyds of London is betting that the war will be over in
1942.  (Kansas City, Missouri)

I think the war will be over this year.  If you knew
what I know, you would think so too.  The Government is
planning something big and it is coming up this fall.
(Birmingham, Alabama).

All soldiers and sailors believe that the war will be
over by Christmas, and that they will be with their
families by Christmas.  (St. Louis, Missouri)

As we have conceived it, [is] rumors [or] an stories spread by word of
mouth.  When we try to compare rumors with the more authoritative forms
of transmission of information, we find a rather complicated structure.
There is no simple relationship between the frequency with which items
are referred to in the newspapers, and the frequency with which rumors
are reported.  Around Portland there were many shipbuilding rumors, but
an analysis of the Portland newspapers revealed a minimum of shipbuilding
news.  Similarly in New Brunswick, rumors related to camp life, and the
local newspapers carried very little on this topic.  However, we do find
that there is much space devoted to rationing in the newspapers and also that there are
many rumors on this topic.
