War News
1.  The Yorktown has not been sunk as was reported in the paper, but it
      is resting on a sandbar and will soon be taken off and will come into
      port under her own power.  (Government employee.  9/25/42)
2.     No one is pay attention any more to what come out of Washington.
      Everyone is working at cross purposes and when one makes a statement
       another denies it.  (Businessman.  10/9/42)
3.   It is useless to read the papers for correct war news.  Announce-
      ments one day are contradicted the next.  (Businessman.  10/8/42)
