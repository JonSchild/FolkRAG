And we button down the back -- on the side -- they button.  You know
how they fasten on?  An' when she go t' whip me, she bring up all my
clothes ov' my head and twist that ov' my head, y'see?  I can't see
and I can't nohow get out; boy nothing but a jig!  Oh, ho, that's 
just great goodness!  We had a dawg named Black Boy.  I was tellin'
the chulren about it the other day.  An' old Black Boy, Ma had to
shut him up in a room to whup me.   [An that ol Black Boy] Or either
outdoors.  An' old Black Boy [he ?] was tearin' all he could to get in them
windows -- was them ol' shadow windows -- he couldn't get in.  He'd
leap right through that window.  He wouldn't bother her; he'd grab
for that switch.  Everytime Mama'd go to slap me, he'd grab for
that switch -- kinda cool.  Ha, ha, I'd be glad when Black Boy get
in there.  He's a great, ragged, brown dawg, raised up with me.
Just grab that switch, an' that would he'p.me.  I could see my old
lady, she'd give him a lick with the switch an' he'd go "owup" and
come back again for that switch.  Ah, ha; I'd sure would be glad
when Black Boy come in.

AL:    Did she bring the blood, honey, or just make it red?

BJ:     Oh, no, no.  [I've seen chulren they] Never whupped 'till no
blood come.  I've seen chulren in that condition, all right.  But
I never have been,

AL:    You've seen children whipped 'till the blood came?

BJ:     That's right.  Oh, I know of one lady, she used to whip her step-chulren 
so -- she had Carrie Belle and two stepchildren, Carrie Belle
and 'Ginia and John Henry -- she had Carried Belle and them whupped, beat 'em
so much around them laigs with them swutches -- them ol' black gum
switches don't break and tea swutches don't break [$$] an' their laigs
looked like they had risin's on them.  You know, had sores that
didn't got well; just look bad, you know, and the blood just stream
outa them sores.  They just stand there; don't holler or nothin'; just
say, "Yes 'M, Miss Laurie." -- her name Laurie -- "Yes 'Miss Laurie;
Yes'M, Miss Laurie."  An' the blood comin' out. I've seen that; that's
true.  An' she had two chulren before him, an' she didn't do them that
way.  But the Lord fixed it that I heard it since I've been grown
that they got worser than that, you see.  (Talking about her own two
children)  They have got on the chain gang.  They have got beat with
with straps -- those big straps and things that they whup them with.  
What used to be on the chain gang, see?
