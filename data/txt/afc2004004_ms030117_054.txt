you love, don't tie up wid nobody.  Cause there's gon come a time
if dey comes around, you're gon put in some time wid em.  Thass truth.
I'm tellin you. . .I don't care what man you hang up wid, let that man
know, say, "Now lissen:  There's some man in this worl I love, an any
time he come in this town, I'm gon be wid him awhile."  An if he
don't like th at, let him go.  I don't care how good a help he can
be t o you.  If you been sufferin, you got to suffer right on.  Don't 
pick up a man jes cause that he can hep you.  If you do, you'll
suffer shore nuff.  Be a woman, it'll stick out on huh.  Thass all theah
i s bout that.  Be a man, it'll stick out on him.  Where it hurts
a man though:  God nevah have made m an fur no woman's glory.  God
made wo-man for man's glory.  Th ass why he have to plead so hard to
a woman.  Why a woman oughta have sympathy fur him.  Git down on his
knees, throw up both hans, "Honey, I hope God may kill me, I'll be
a sweet lil boy if you'll jes do one thang to satisfy me, I'll be
sweet."
(Do you think women ever feel that way about men?)
What? What? How? (scorns the idea)
(I think they feel that way.)
You know one thang?...You may think that...But they'll
soon git ovah it. She'll so on wear it off. You see a lot of men layin
out heah in the streets some time, drunk? Some woman cause that.
You see lot of these women, sometimes, done turn out to be broken.
Cer'ny. I agree wid chu bout that. Lot of men have cause women to ruin
their lives. Raised up in the church too. Cert'n  y. Man nevah be able 
to give a man consolation, but there'll always be some woman give one
to him. "What you worry bout one old man fur? Why don't you git two
or three? Don't nevah start wid one?" Yo u always have someone tell
you that. You git wid this one, git wid that one. "Come on,
less drink some." Atter one glass, you understan, you be cuttin up
