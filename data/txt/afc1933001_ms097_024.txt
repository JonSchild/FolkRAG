Dear Mr. Botkin :
I thank you fro a copy 
of the beautifully printed and interesting
"Seventy-Five Years of Freedom"
I wish to comment briefly on 
an article by Professor Sterling A. 
Brown, on page 19 he purportedly
quoted form a song in the Archives,
[who] which I recorded, from a Negro 
cook (woman) whose husband had 
taught it to her. He had just returned
from the "County Farm" where he had 
been for a year for thievery. As the 
record goes (you can check by 
playing it) [it run]  the first 
stanza runs
"Another man done gone,
Another man done gone, 
From the County Farm, etc.
