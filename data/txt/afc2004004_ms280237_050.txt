That very soon he gave consent,
An' into the woods together they went,
While he preformed and she pretuned,
The boy in the boot he kept time to the tune on her
Rumpatum tooral looral addity
Rumpatum tooral looral day.

Now six weeks bein' over, as I have been told,
She gave him some fire to keep himfrom cold,
To keep him from cold by night an' by day,
He cursed the young damsel that learned him to play on her
Rumpatum tooral looral addity
Rumpatum tooral looral day.

Now all the young men come listen a while,
I've told you what happened at Firelock Stile,
Or else like me you'll rue the day,
You go into the woods for to learn to play on her
Rumpatum tooral looral addity
Rumpatum tooral looral day.

Cox:
In a little town called Belfast, apprentice to trade I was bound,
An' many an hour of sweet happiness have I spent in that neat
                                                          little town.
Till bad misfortune came over me,
An' caused me to stray from the land,
Far away from me friends and relations,
Betrayed by the black velvet band.

Her eyes they shone like diamonds, 
I thought her the queen o' the land,
An' her hair it hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band.

I took a stroll down Broadway,
Meanin' not long for to stay,
An' who should I see but a pretty fair maid
Come trippin' along the pathway.

She was both fair an' handsome,
Her neck it was just like a swan,
And her hair it hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band.

Her eyes they shone like diamonds,
I thought her the queen of the the land,
And her hair it hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band.
