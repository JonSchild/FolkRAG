walked in there an' te-- asked Mr. Hunt (?) to -- say, "What do
become of the bands when the fi-- ah, -- when the gin house burnt
down?"
AL:  And what'd he say?
BJ:  I don't know a doggoned thing about it."  "[Thing] Nothin' about it."
Just walkin' the flo'.  Jus' a guilty conscience, bear no
'cuser (BEARS NO ACCUSER).
     Was not a ban' on it, nowhere.  Jus' look in the place, an' 
you see a ban' nowhere!  An' you know, where theycotton had sit,
ov' in the place, where they everybody's cotton was settin' in
its opposite place.  Done already ginned and already, you know,
baled up.  An' jus' sit there.  An' that's right.
     Now that happened.  Natchully.
AL:  Then they didn't want you to have anything, huh?
BJ:  Well, you see they burned out -- They, they, you know, I
guess didn't wan' 'em to have it.  Now the next -- 'Cause the
 next year, they wouldn't a-had a gone into debt for anything.
Ya see, they could do -- go ahead on an' sharecrop an', an then
everything, then.  They make it all the way through the next
year would come to 'em.  You see, that's just a hope, that's a
step that they could make to he'p theyse'ves with.
     Jus' tear it down.  Tore-tore it down completely.
One, one single boy had had 5 bales in there.  Him an' his
mother, together.  An' so, they jus' call 'im Coon; he was a gitar picker.
AL:  Cotton was worth about how much money?
BJ:  Well, 'cordin' to how much the cotton was, ya know, a, a,
a pound, ya know.  How, [Bout] how much those -- 'Cause see, one, one, 
one baled weigh[ed] as high as 13 pounds, 13 and a half, like that.
