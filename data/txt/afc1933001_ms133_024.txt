that by that time we will be so fat and settled we won't want to leave Washington.

We didn't get a chance to really talk all the time we were in Wilton, and I hope you were as sorry about that as I was. My buzzing about in New York brought some results. Olin Downes has asked for me as folklore adviser at the New York World's Fair, and it may mean something very handsome within the next year; and I will be able to see you every week or so. That is one of the most important things that motivated me from the beginning to try the World's Fair project.

Will you please come to see us as soon as you can and remember that we love you more than anyone else in the world, Bess and Steve respectively excepted, perhaps. Give my best wishes to Tillman.

With love --
