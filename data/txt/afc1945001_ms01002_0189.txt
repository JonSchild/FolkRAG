February 28, 1942.

Dear Mr. Nelson:
         I am very sorry to be so late in answering your special
delivery letter of February 23rd, but I have just returned to
Princeton.

            At the present moment I am so up to my neck in research
of various kinds that I am afraid I would be unable to help you
with the Clinic at Princeton.  Furthermore, to be quite frank, I
sense a great deal of danger in this undertaking unless it is controlled
with the very greatest of care and I should say by some 
such government agency as the Office of Facts and Figures.  Otherwise, 
it seems to me that there is a very real possibility that 
this set-up might unwittingly supplement rather than counteract 
Axis propaganda.  The reason for my feeling this way is that unless 
a person is much more astute even than propaganda "experts", I don't 
believe that even with an enormous amount of training [t]he[y] [are] is able 
to understand the full implications of much of the rumor and also 
much of the news [t]he[y] encounters.
         
            I am sorry to be a wet blanket on this scheme and would
be glad to write more in detail if you are interested.  But I 
honestly would advise you to go pretty slowly.

                                  Sincerely yours,

                                   Hadley Cantril
