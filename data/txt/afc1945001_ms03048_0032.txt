Rumor Report - Week of August 3, 1942
7. Jewish refugees are swarming into the United States from
all over the world. Before the war is ended, all the Jews will be
living in America. Philadelphia is fast becoming more Jewish than
New York, because a large number of Jewish refugees are settling here,
and large numbers of New York Jewish people are moving in because 
there is more money around Philadelphia now than there is in New
York.
Philadelphia -- 8/6/42. Electric crane operator. Philadelphia
resident for 32 years. Above average intelligence. High in Masonic

F. Miscellaneous Rumors
1. There will be no more civilian travel by train to Atlantic
City after August 15.
Philadelphia -- 8/5/42. Not known personally. Appeared to be of 
average intelligence.
2. Is it true that the Government has asked for certain types
of female hair for use in the manufacture of war weapons?
Philadelphia -- 8/6/42. Below average intelligence. Five and ten
cent store clerk.
3. Is it true that travel to seashore resorts will be stopped after August 15th?
Philadelphia -- 8/6/42. Character good. Average Intelligence.
4. Our soldiers are complaining that they don't get enough
milk to drink at the Army camps. They say they just get enough to
wet their cereal. I hope it's not true, because my boy used to drink
a quart of milk a day, when he was home.
Harrisburg -- 8/7/42. Housewife. Middle class.
5. Nothing has been done by the Government about the rubber
that was collected last month. It's still standing around the oil
company yards. You would think that if the Government needed rubber
so badly, and in such a hurry, they would have done something about
it before this.
Philadelphia -- 8/8/42. Truck driver. Average intelligence.
6. We collect the scrap, and then the junk dealers get it
and sell it at high profits to the Government, who we thought we
were collecting it for.
Philadelphia -- 8/5/42. Housewife. Some college education.
