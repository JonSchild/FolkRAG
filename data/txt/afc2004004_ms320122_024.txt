intelligent woman, you know.
A. LOMAX  But tell me what, how do you
define what is to be a Cajun anyway?  What do you think
Cajun is, means?
MR. FOUGET  Well it's just a, the French
people had came from, from France and Canada, like I said,
they just, instead of saying Canadian they said Cajun, cut
it short, that's, that's one way.
A. LOMAX  Right.
MR. FOUGET  Cut it short.  They're like
negros, you know, call them niggers.  And they don't like to
be called that.  But really they're negros.
A. LOMAX  What about coon ass, how does
that. . .
MR. FOUGET  Oh.  That, that just come out.
A. LOMAX  That's new.
MR. FOUGET  If you was a . . .
A. LOMAX  Just new saying, huh?
MR. FOUGET  Yeah.  [Ron Gidre] got rid of
that.  Not supposed to call anybody coon ass anymore.  No
it, if it was a Cajun so it's a bunch of coon ass, you know,
a bunch Cajun, just a, just talk, that's all.
A. LOMAX  Let's take, let's take a few
