College Freshman
Female - White


1.  I heard quite awhile ago from another person that
among other things - sugar, shoes etc.  that clothes
would be rationed and we would get only a very
little a year for them.  I have also heard that
soon all products that we know buy without
thinking at stores will be strictly rationed.

2.  The idea that during war time more boys
are born than girls has been discussed.  It is 
figured that because of the numerous boys killed
 in the war new baby boys are added to make up
for those lost and killed.

3.  Concerning the idea in no. 1 I heard a story
about some man who sent into Washington for a 
sugar ration book and got instead a clothes rationing
book.  I have heard this from 3 sources each about
a different individual who sent in for it.
