MONTANA

now having all this trouble with India--looks like she's pulling our
leg for everything she can get. How about these Canadian soldiers
sent down here for Training, (Fort William Henry Harrison) just an excuse
for us to clothe, feed and take care of her men. I wouldn't mention
this anywhere outside of this office, but I'm not the only one who thinks
that way." (Told to me by a War Agency Director)

1. Congress is waiting until after the election to do anything about
wages and fixing of farm prices. Then watch for a draft of the 16-year
old group. (Businessman)

1. The Montana Office of the War Production Board is absolutely powerless.
Requests for priorities are referred to Washington, D.C. If it is not
permitted to function to say "yes" or "no" to requests for priorities,
why was it ever created. The office should be given elemental powers
or be abolished. (Publisher of weekly paper)

2. A thousand rumors about the labor situation in Butte were liquidated
at a meeting last night. The unions are formulating demands to be
submitted to the A.C.M. Co. shortly and an agreement will probably be
worked out before the present contract expires in October. (This was
told by a Butte hotel manager to several men, and he was just leaving
so I didn't get to speak with him about the situation. However, about
a month ago, there was some talk about some unrest in labor circles.
Will look into this further.)
