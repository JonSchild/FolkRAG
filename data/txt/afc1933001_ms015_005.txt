My dear Mr. Kleberg:

âœ“
Professor John A. Lomax, author and eminent authority 
on A merican folk-songs, is acting as Honorary Custodian of
the Archives of American Folk-Song in the Library of Congress.
Professor Lomax is at present in Texas, making phonographic
recordings of folk-songs for the Library.  He has written 
to me on several occasions about the courteous reception
he received at your King Ranch and the helpful cooperation
which your brother kindly offered to him.

Mr. Lomax has been anxious that his appreciation of 
these courtesies be expressed to you also, and that you be
informed of the work he is doing for the Library.  Personally,
I cannot speak too highly of it.  Mr. Lomax and his son
Alan - who acts as his assistant in making the records - ,
on hand at the Spring Round-Up of the King Ranch this year,"
as he seems hopeful of gathering there among the Mexican "cow-
pokes" some especially interesting material.

Anything that you might be good enough or able to do, in 
order to facilitate this enterprise at the King Ranch, will be
greatly appreciated by Mr. Lomax and by the Library.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

the April issue of the"Musical Quarterly" where on page 177 to
187 you will find an article by Mr. Lomax describing some of his
experiences in collecting Negro folk-songs.
