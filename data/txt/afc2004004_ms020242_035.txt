She says, "I wasn't after her. I was after Red Boy." An'
so, an' then she told 'em just what she'd done.
So they went together, her and Mama.
AL: What'd she do?
BJ: Her and Mama went together down in the woods together an' 
got -- The hair [in] out the fireplace, where I had comb my hair? Come out
my haid? I used to clip my hair, [then;] Too ya know? I had long hair
then. But Will's hair is jest like yo's or any other white per-
son hair. See? That's the diffrunt in it. She know that wasn'
none a my hair -- ah, my hair. In those days, I didn't straighten
my hair with no straightenin' comb. I just used string, you know?

tree, ya know? Just cut it out an' glued it right back. An'
then cut a hole in that tree. An' put a cork stopper, you know,
