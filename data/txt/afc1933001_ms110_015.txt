Dear Father & Deanie:

   I returned last night
from my jaunt to Dallas, which turned out
nice in all respects. The Pottses were
hospitable and genial hosts to the extent
that I felt fully at home with them.
The game was a thriller, certainly one of 
the most interesting and satisfactory as 
to outcome in my history.

Bid prices on the bank
stocks are 46 1/2 and 73. I found Mike working
in the Stilwells' yard, and I met Mr. King. 
He is a hot shot, isn't he ? I'd say he 
would be hard to get along with over a
period of time. The house seems to be
taken care of properly, for I could see
nothing out of line. He said friends had
wanted to borrow books, but that he would
lend nothing.

I came thru Austin
yesterday afternoon to find Aunty just
departed to Chickasha on account of Uncle
Joe's death Sunday afternoon, to be buried
this afternoon. I am writing Aunt Sue
today. 

I would predict now
that we will be here into next week and
our departure to Houston will come only then.
En route to Dallas I went by Burnet and 
surprisingly found that the Texaco man still
is in the notion of selling. His health is
better, but he thinks his work yet makes him
nervous, and that he'd best be out. I am
to again get in touch with him after his
preliminary negotiations are started with
the company and after my draft status is 
determined.
