No I think that would be worse.
   I just sent a note to a very
svelte blond Parisian & she sent
it back.  My heart hurts from
shame.  I shouldn't risk myself
like that.  Or if so I should not 
do it without some grounds of success
   It seems to me that I hold
my breath for very long stretches
All of this is horrible & incomprehensible
to me.  Why is it?
