Three hundred souls, - the steamer's freight -
Crowd forward wild with fear,
While at the stern the dreadful flames
Above the deck appear.
                                    7
John Maynard watched the nearing flame,
But still with steady hand
He grasped the wheel, and steadfastly
He steered the ship to land.
"John Maynard" with an anxious voice,
The captain cries once more,
"Stand by the wheel five minutes yet!
And we will reach the shore."
                                       8
Through flames and smoke that dauntless heart
Responded firmly, still
Unawed, though face to face with death,
"With God's good grace I will!"
                                     9
The flames approach with giant strides,
They scorch his hands and brow;
One arm disabled seeks his side,
Ah, he is conquered now!"
But no, his teeth are firmly set,
He crushes down the pain, - 
His knee upon the stanchion pressed,
He guides the ship again.
