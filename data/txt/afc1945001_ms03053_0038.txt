Utah Ogden E.E.G. Dentist
I had to confirm by long-distance telephone that my dentist had
nothing specific to report, inasmuch as he did not forward his rumors
in the special delivery envelope I left for his convenience... He stated
over the phone that the only rumors he had heard were "testimonials of
inefficiency and a total lack of patriotism among defense workers at the
Ogden military installations..... in which the previously unemployed
class were the worst offenders.... plain bums who didn't choose to work
under any circumstances...etc."
I regret that my instructions were not clear in his mind as he could
undoubtedly have added considerably to this study... He, however, will be
willing to cooperate in future studies , and, under proper instruction, he
can become an excellent rumor-collector.
