DOCTRINE OF THE RAIDER BATTALION

1. We are Raiders of the Land and Sea.

2. We work together for Democracy.

3. Gung Ho! Gung Ho! Gung Ho! Ho!

4. We are tough; we are just; 
    We fight when e'er we must
    for the right to be free.

5. We want to do our duty -- 
    because it's right; 
    and our duty will give those japs a fright.

6. We execute all orders with a promptitude
    That will shatter the Mikado's latitude

7. We are unbeatable-because we're right;
    Those Japs can't lick us-for we've got might.

8. We're Raider - for Democracy.
    We work together; that's why we're free.

GUNG HO! GUNG HO! GUNG HO! HO!
