[*TRUE GHOST STORY! SPIRIT GIVES BJ $300 IN DEAD MONEY*]
[*MILLEN*]

Uh, where I was uh, stayin' at Millen, this same place I
tellin' ya about there, between my Mama's ah, ah, cottonfield an'
Mr. Singleton's cottonfield, was a lil' ditch. An' some, some
money was give to me on that ditch. You know, right in...You
know. An' Mr. Singleton got that. But that was a lil' bit a 
money, 3 hundred dollars. But more than I ever have had in my
life...An' hit, hit, hit was ready ta use. It was usin' money. 
AL: It was what?
BJ: It was ready to use; didn't have to have it changed. It
was lately.
AL: In bills?
BJ: That's right -- No, no. All, all, all in silver. All in
silver, every bit, money. It, it was in a , in a, ah, some kind
of a jar-ish-lookin' thing. Old-fashioned chewin'-lookin' thing.
Ah, ah, type wood. (?)
AL: Buried very deep?
BJ: No, it wasn' -- Hit was pretty deep, but ya see, where the
ditch was cut. The ditch was -- a deep ditch was cut in there.
An' ah, when I was there home an' when that spirit was --
AL: Tell us about how it all happened.
BJ: Wh-when I was in -- I was home. In the bed, in my bed a-sleepin'.
I reckon I was asleep. But I had got up an'
cooked breakfast an' I layed back down. An' so, I thought someone
come in the door. An' I just thought it was, ya know, in my
mind, the way I feel, like there was somebody comin' in the house.
An' seemed like hit was Miss, it was Miss Sarah. An' you know,
so. An' as she talked to me an' tol' me about this money, it
looked like to me, I say to myself, "What you tellin' me about that?
You ain't dead." An' no sooner I say that than I woke wide awake
