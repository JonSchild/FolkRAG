in Spain. C-L-E-R-Y. In Ireland they put the A in it. Barcelona,
that's where me mother told me. She's very dark, used to wear a 
little lace on top of her head. She was an excellent lace-maker,
embroidery and all that. She was a singer, played a guitar - a most
remarkable one. She had several different kinds of instruments that
I can't describe now - but one - the guitar with the two little
shafts, one at each side. 'Twas a full-size guitar - but at each
side there was a shaft with strings on it.
Lomax: It was a lute. Did she sing?
Barry: She sung in her own language. She could speak Gaelic, too,
as well as her own language, and Italian. Her ancestors was from
Italy.
Lomax: Your father's people - what were they?
Barry: Me father's people - he had sisters who were singers as well.
But they used to have local sing-songs in houses, and dance, playing
in little concert halls, poor like.
Lomax: Did they speak Gaelic?
Barry: O they do, yes. Me father's sister was a good Gaelic speaker
and great singers. Father had one sister, and she was Ireland's
famous singer in them days. No, they didn't go around in caravans.
They went in trains - sung through the trains. Footballs and all
them wasn't so numerous as they are today. Just very few. In them
days you seldom saw any football going on. Poor times, I suppose --
they hadn't the money to get these things up. But very great now.
Big footballs in Ireland now. When I went to ARMAGH to the footballs
I got more money in an hour. Withthe footballers, got drunk and 
followed me up and used to book seats and was with the team. I knew
all the teams, all those even that played finals, semi-finals, All-Ireland.
Phil Brady, John George O'Riley, kicking for Kevin, and 
had been very good footballers indeed. So in Armagh, I knew George,
and he said to me, "Maggie, will you come to the football next
Sunday?"
I said, "Well, if I can get a seat."
"O, we'll hold a sweat for ye."
I used to sing for them going down in the bus, and play for them,
entertain them going down. Maybe 5 or 6 buses'd leave the square.
Then when we were coming back I'd be so tired I'd only play a 
cople of tunes. But they used to have a collection for me going
down and for the driver coming back.
Lomax: Were you married then?
Barry: O yes, but that didn't stop me from going to places. I was
at footballs and kept going.
Lomax: Your husband - what was his background?
