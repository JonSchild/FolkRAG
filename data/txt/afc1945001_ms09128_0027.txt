7. "When I see a fish it reminds me
of my sister who finally hooked
the Navy officer that kept nibbling
around."

8. There's a soldier at Camp Whoosis
Who remembers her sweet kiss
And her promise to be faithful
Until he Mrs. this fair Miss.
 
Oh, the visions of the future
Make him feel just like a King,
But the lady "ain't no lady" . . . . .
She's told fifty the same thing!!
