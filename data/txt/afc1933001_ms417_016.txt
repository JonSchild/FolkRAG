RUBEN

Chorus: O, Ruben, poor Ruben
Tell me, where you been gone so long?

When Ruben left home, he was a little bitty lad
When he came back he was a fullgrown man, Oh, Lord,
When he came back he was full grown man.

Repeat Chorus.

Well, they got ol' Ruben down, and they took his watch and
That was everything the poor boy had, Oh, Lord, charm,
That was everything the poor boy had.

Repeat Chorus.
