12B War English
female White

(1) Everyone has said that at Curtiss
Wright, people are being paid
for just putting in time.  We 
heard that they are not turning
out goods at all like they could.

(2) We heard how dumb some of
the women are they hire.  It seems that
almost anyone can get a job 
there.  I read in a newspaper once
where the writer said he overheard
two women talking from Curtiss Wright.
One was explaining to the other that
she could drill to 1/1000 of an inch.
The other asked her, "how many one
thousands are there in an inch," and
she said she didn't know but there
must be millions.  This was to prove
how dumb they were.

(3) Last Saturday someone started
a rumor that clothes were going to
be rationed.  It came in the store
where I worked and everyone was
trying to buy as much as possible
before midnight (the time clothes
was supposed to be rationed.)

(4) Some people say Pres. Roosevelt
is trying to be a dictator and he
should not be reelected.  Some say
his wife used an awful lot of gas
going to England that could have
been put to a better use.
