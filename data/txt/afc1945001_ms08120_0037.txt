War Stories

1. The slip of the lips sink a
ship.

2. What did the little dog say
when he ran through the fire?"
"He said, Whee? I've just
been defurred!"

3. "Did you say you wanted
your eggs turned over as the
Japs turned over." "The Japs
turned over?"

4. A girl was at a dance. She
met a sailor, marine, coastguard,
and a arm man. They started
fight with each other over
her. When they finish they
look at each other and
said, why should we be
fighting over her. The country
needs us, not her. We got
to fight the Japs not America
citizen.
