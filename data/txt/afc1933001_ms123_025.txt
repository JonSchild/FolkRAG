[came] should come, they might eat. I was then told to [l] raise the kata,
stand it on its legs, figuratively.  [Then it was given to eat.]
An egg was [smashed on its head] broken on its head and
the white rubbed [on] into the top surface.  [whil and then] The yoke
was poured into the butt end of the drum and sloshed about on the
inner surface of the skin.  Then the mama tambour was given
to eat in [the same] a like manner of egg and orange.  The heads of the
drums were then covered with clean white cloths and they were set in a corner, [to] to dry and await
baptism.  I was then instructed in the care of the drums. 
On my departure, [like two This ceremony , while not regarded as the 
equivalent of an actual baptism] I left [three] sixty cents in the ropes of the drums.  [This 
was] to be distributed in bits to everyone who came to the house [so that 
when] and at the crossroads so that when the drums spoke everyone would
have to assemble.

It happened that I never had time to have the drums actually
[p] baptized and given names [i by a] in the regular fashion;
but I was told that , although my drums would never serve as
part of the paraphhnalia of [voodoo] "hounfort" (vaudou cult
house), that they [would now] would because of the ceremony I have described, have the [strength and courage] "heart" to
[furnish the] make music for [any] a dance.

[The names given drums and cult objects , when they are
baptixed doesn't seem to matter.  I saw drums, handkerchiefs and
rara batons [all] baptized and their godmothers and godmothers
seemed to give them the first names that came into their heads.
At least [I] that's what I did and no one seemed surprised when 
I baptized on baton Francois Villon and another Baudlaire.
Indeed, these objects were sometimes given as mant as four
or five names and the more [commeres] god-mothers and comperes [wq2] godfathers that could
be assembled the better, since each one was expected, and did
generally, give a present to his or her [fls] foster-child.]
