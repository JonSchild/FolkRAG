And so he sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to mourn 
O what a scortching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn 
Perhaps he's got to heaven , there's none of us can say 
But if I'm right in my surmise he's gone the other way... 
That's the way Americans have felt about their bandits, even their
gun thugs... If you can go down in Oklahoma and begin talking against 
their pet outlaws, like Sam Ba s and Jesse James, something will 
hit you , boy and it won't be no train....
