Hi! Fol! Diddle all day!

and if to you this mill I make, p
pray tell me the toll that you mean to take. Hi! Fol! .....

3.Father, you know my name is Jack;
out of a bushel I'll take a peck;
for if my fortune I would make, O
O that is the toll that I mean to take. Hi! Fol! .....

4.Son, O son, I'm afraid you're a fool,
you have not learned to follow my rule.
To you this mill I will not give,
for by such a toll no man can live.

and beat the farmer when he comes back. Hi! Fol! ....

10.Glory be to God, the old man says,
I've got one son that's learned my ways.
Hallelujah! the old woman cried,
and the old man straightened out his legs and he died.
Hi! Fol! Diddle all day!
