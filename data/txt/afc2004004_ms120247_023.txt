The Ceremony of the Breaking of the Cakes
 Le Roux Habitation, Pont Beudet, January 7, 1937.

(This account is intended merely to give the setting for a group
 of discs, not as an explanation or definitive description of a
ceremony. It is based on notes that were taken while a ceremony
was going forward in a hounfort or vaudoo temple and while the 
first records that were ever made inside a hounfort were being
registered. It has been hard to supplement these notes because
the mombo(priestess of the hounfort) is very timid and the other
members of the community seem to have little precise impression
of a ritual.)

a sudden bend to the left and runs straight away to the nearby

two open markets (one for animals and the other for fruit, vegetables,
etc.) This is the center of Pont Beudet, but that name 
spreads over a vague stretch of the Plaine of the Cul-de-Sac
to include a number of habitations where there that boast of
no general store, and no gasoline pump. One of these habitations
is called Le Roux. It too has its center and its environs, because
its boundaries are vaguely defined as the boundaries of an old
plantation of many of the colonial days. Habitants of La Roux belong to the 
Marseille family either by blood or by marriage and where the Mar-
seille hounfort is located, just behind the National Asylum for
the Insane, there is a political and social center of Le Roux. ---
