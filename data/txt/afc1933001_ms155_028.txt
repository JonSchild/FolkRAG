REFERRING TO

Alan Lomax has in Washington with him today and tomorrow a folk
singer for whose excellence he vouches. This singer, Woodie Guthrie by 
name, is willing to sing many recordings for the Archive of American 
Folk Song while in the city. I recommend that 50 (fifty) blank acetate
discs be purchased at once, the cost to be about $35.00 and charged to
Increase.
