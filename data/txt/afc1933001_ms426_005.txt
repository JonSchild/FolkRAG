value for each meeting.  The exchanges are at your
service.  If you will accumulate orders and send them
through your local elevator or co-operative, you will
stimulate interest and make a good saving.  Get on the
firing line for oil, flour, manufactured feeds and
twine.

Seventh.  Now you are ready for business.  Start
your meeting and start it in order.  The president
should prevent the noise and confusion of several talking
at once.  Hold the business down to business, get
your business done, then turn the house upside down
for fun if its fun they want, but while the business 
is going on, business is business.

Eighth.  Have a sick and flower committee and
make it work.  Collect the pennies by using a little
child, each meeting, to pay for the flowers.  Do not
make this a part of the regular business but turn the
child loose while the folks are gathering, and see the
fun.

Ninth.  Plan a yearly affair, of a play or social, a
picnic, and make it a big one.

Tenth.  Get your merchants in your nearby town
to put on Farmer Union days and your committees,
help them put these days across.

P. S. Don't forget the lunch.

If you are a farmer and do not belong to some
farm organization, how can you reconcile your self
respect with the fact that you are allowing your
neighbor farmers to carry the load, while you are bumming
a free ride and receiving the benefits which organized
farmers have made possible for you to enjoy?
     -Kansas Union Farmer.

Let it be known that you have a Union, and that
you expect your Union to be recognized as an honorable
organization through which you are going to
obtain the justice, which has been denied farmers as an
unorganized class.
     -E. E. GREENE
