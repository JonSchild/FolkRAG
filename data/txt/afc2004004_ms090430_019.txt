and possess large tracts which are cultivated almost entirely, and preferably
by Negro tenants.  Less than 10 per cent of the farm operators (7.6 per cent)
were full owners in 1935, and this represented an increase over 1930.
   The county is representative of the area in which cotton production
is carried on in the best traditional manner, in contrast to the high producing
areas in the southwest.  The plantation system survives in a classic form,

commercial cotton production is carried on according to a system divorced from
the slave plantation tradition.
    Coahoma is smaller in land area and population than Bolivar.  Its
total population is 46,327, but of these, 35,858, or 77 per cent, are Negroes.
Its rural population is 78 per cent of the total, and there are about 4,000
people classified as rural non-farm scattered among the depots and small
villages.
   The principal difference between the two counties is the size and
function of the chief trading center.  Clarksdale, the largest town in Coahoma
County has a population of 10,043 persons.  This town is the center of most
of the "urban" life in the county, and functions as an active commercial center
where the smaller places have achieved little growth.  Much of the commerce of
the county flows through this town.  It has most of the 66 wholesale establishments
of the county whose net sales have amounted to as much as $33,617,877.
The volume of sales was approximately double that of Bolivar County.  Although
this county has a population a little more than half that of Bolivar it has
almost as many retail stores.  Instead of being distributed in several small
centers, as in Bolivar, two-thirds of Coahoma's retail stores are concentrated
