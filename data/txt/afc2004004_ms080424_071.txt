Stan:   Yeah, here's a, did you make these?
Hat:   No, I don't know.....
AL:   Put it on the floor.   (spins a top)
Hat:   Your ddaddy never  (unint.)...
Stan:  Well, us boys got awful distrusted sometimes, got pretty mad sometimes,
but you know, it would wear off.  We thought a lot of him, but still, you'd
get mad at these things, he'd get too rough on ya.  But later on I got
grown,  I appreciate it.
AL:   Why did you appreciate it?
Stan:   Well, because he learnt us how to get out here and make a livin' with
our own.  And,  we didn't have to depend on nobody else, you know. He
learned us when we growed up how to farm, and how to do this, and how to 
br(?) your hogs,  how to (unint.)  and stuff like that.
Hat:   and how to get herbs.
Stan:   Yeah, and how to grow all ths stuff, and I appreciate it.  'Cause he
knowed about this,  and he took us out and showed us all this wood and 
stuff you know, and how to make these toys and this stuff.  It was worth
a lot to us.  But now the days and time, it's different, you know, with me,
with the young ones,  they don't realize what came off at that time.  But 
maybe in the time come, a lot of young people are comin' back to this.
AL:    What's this thing you got here?
Stan:   Well now this here...you're supposed to throw it up and catch it like
this,  but I ain't playin nothin' like this in a good long while.
AL:    Maybe your sister could do it better.
Stan:   You're supposed to throw it up and catch it in that...
AL: uhuh..you'll never make it...too old and stiff!
Stan:  Too old and stiff and my bones is gettin'  (unint)  you know, and she
had a lot of stuff down in here.
