Agwe Woyo is god of the sea, but, as might be expected, 
neither he nor his son and daughter, Agweto and Agweta Woyo, figures 
as importantly in Mirebalais as in coastal areas. For the folk of 
Mirebalais, the river-gods, particularly the spirit of the Artibonite 
River, are of much greater importance. This loa named Clairmé, a Petro
deity like his wife and daughter, Mme. Clairmé and Clairmézine, lives
in the deepest part of the stream with the other members of his "family."
Similarly, the deepest parts, or bassins, of tributary streams hold the
spirits of those waters.  And since all these tributaries flow into the 
Artibonite, and the Artibonite empties into the ocean, it is said that
when the river is in flood, Clairmé is engaged in inspecting his domain,
being greeted by the spirits of all the smaller rivers as he passes
their mouths.  At this time, the flow of the water in each tributary
is arrested until he has gone by, when, in a great swirl, it joins the
flooded Artibonite as its master accompanies Clairmé on his way to consult
with the great ruler of the sea, Agwe.  Actually, at the height of 
the rainy season the force of the light-colored muddy water of the major
stream holds back the darker colored flow of its tributaries in a manner
which accords with the legend, so that, observing the Tombe River at
one such time, the Haitians who were present said, "The Tombe is waiting
for its master to pass."

Gede, a deity who figures both in the Rada and Petro groups
as chief functionary under Baron Samedi, ruler of cemeteries, is tolerated
rather than favored, though his rewards to his devotées include the
refusal to dig a premature grave for them.  When Gede possesses a devotée
at a dance, Damballa, Ogun and the other Rada gods "leave" at once, and
those who are possessed by them come out of their possessions.  For though
