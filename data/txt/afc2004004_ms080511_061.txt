[*15.17.59.00*] A   The people who came into the mountains found 
themselves in paradise. An enormous range of 
flora and fauna made it just ah, a wonderful 
ah, um... place for these ah people from the 
bare hills of Scotland and, ah, and the harsh 
country of Northern Ireland to come. They were 
after all, ah, hunters and fishers in their 
background, ah - and ah they'd been -the lands 
had been enclosed and the game had been hunted 
out, but in America they had all they could 
- they, they - all the game they needed. And ah 
they devoted themselves to that and still do. 

You know, Americans have refused to be -ah, 
to give up their guns, and this part of the 
- this pioneer background where ah, one of 
the reason that people wanted to come here in 
the first place and enjoyed their difficult times 
on the frontier, was because of the hunting 
experience.
