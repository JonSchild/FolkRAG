"I'm going back to teaching school this fall I suppose.
 I suppose schools will last for a while longer. Did you know 
that the Red Cross hasn't many workers (they have lost so 
many!) and they have been trying to get a blanket draft on 
all school teachers for Red Cross workers. You just don't 
know what they (the government) is going to do anymore."
