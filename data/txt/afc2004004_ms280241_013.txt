come back, and the doctor came up and looked at the child,
and within a few minutes or an hour, the child was dead, and my
dream was quite correct. But it was no dream, it was a warning.
And the thing I seed in my dream I acutally went through it.
Went up the stairs and saw the child in its coffin. What do you
call that - it must have been foresight? There have been several
warnings I've got and have told my people. I canna tell my
husband anything. "I don't want to hear it." - Because so many
of them come true he doesna want to hear it.
Lomax: There's a lot of people with second sight in Scotland?
Jean: Yes, lots of epople, especially among our people. I
suppose lots of people too would laugh at ye if ye said there was
such a thing as a spirit.
Lomax: I never have seen any spirits.
Jean: No? I did.
Lomax: Tell me what you mean by spirits?
Jean: There's such a thing as people as believes in seeing
things, and people as doesn't believe in seeing things. I've
heard things told, and I've seed me saying, "O God, if I was to
see such anthing face to face, such-like as a spirit, I would
drop down and never recover. That's the feeling I had. But I
actually saw a thing and it didn't happen what I thought would
happen. And another person saw the same thing, an hour before me.
The way I knew that when I came round into the house, I didn't let
anyone know, but mark you my surprise when this person had gotten
the same fear I got. I'll tell you what happened. . . .
     My mother lived in a new house up a little bit of the road,
about two minutes walk, and then you came to a corner, and then
you took another three minutes walk and came to a shrubbery in a 
circle, and in there lived my sister-in-law. And my daughter went
round at eleven o'clock, and I was going to take her back home
again. I was coming up the road - the first fall of snow on the
ground and there was a clear room - you could have seen to pick
anything up off the ground it was that clear. A lovely night. And
as I came out of the house, and I've always a habit if alone, of
singing and diddling to myself, and I actually was diddling an
Irish jig. I come right up to the corner, and was just going to
take the turn, and this thing appeared about three yards right
opposite me. It wasn't a living human-being on the road. You'd
no need to be frightened because there was houses on every side
of ye. All you had to do was open the door and walk in, nobody
would have kept you out. But this thing appeared right on the
corner of the road. It was just like a priest, but very, very tall.
