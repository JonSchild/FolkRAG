c/o S. Beyer, 50 West 8th St.
New York, N.Y.

Dear Al:

Contrary to my expectations, I shall not be
in Washington again before the end of the year. I
am writing this to remind you of your promise to
get in touch with me when you come to New York.

There are people whom I should like you to
meet and things about which I would like to talk
to you at greater length, apropos of music and
literature and the things we talked about the morning
I met you.

I am enclosing a copy of something which is
being circulated surreptitiously in New York. I
understand that even certain newspapers in outlying
districts have published this. Marie Prince, whom
you know (she works on the N.L.R.B.), told me that
this is a forgery. I don't know whether she meant
that the original document is a forgery or that this
enclosed thing it. If you can supply me with authentic
information concerning this, I am sure that it will
be valuable.

At any rate, look me up when you get to
New York.

Salud y victoria.
Thomas James Ray
