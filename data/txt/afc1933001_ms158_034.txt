Dear Alan:

I was very much disappointed to find after finishing up with
Leadbelly that you had disappeared, as I wanted to talk to
you before you got away.

Your efforts in bringing Leadbelly and the Golden Gate Boys
together and your supervision of the recordings is certainly
appreciated. Without this cooperation from you, I am sure 
that the whole thing would have been impossible.

I have had the enclosed letter on my desk in New York for
several days expecting to give it to you at the time of the
recording, but you slipped through my fingers. I suppose
it has to do with the investigation which you have made for
Mr. Darnell.

Enclosed is a letter of agreement covering the terms which we
discussed and to which you verbally agreed.

Under separate cover, I am sending you duplicates of the 
recordings which your father made last summer and one or
two which we dubbed from the field recordings which he made
for the Library.

Sincerely yours,
R.P. Wetherald
