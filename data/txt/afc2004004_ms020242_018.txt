who in the world he talkin'. But you can feel it. Ya see?
Boy, he's, he's good, he's out this world. He...an' so...
TL: Well, how do you tell? By sinkholes and charcoals?
BJ: Sometimes.
AL: Singleton was a white man?
BJ: No. He's a colored.
AL: Oh, he's an old colored man.
BJ: Oh, he's from Carolina. He's out this world. He's a doctor
from yonder city. He done great things for me, and others too,
ya know? White and colored; he doctor on white an' colored.
You wouldn't know he's a doctor 'lessen somebody jus' already
knowed it, ya know. An' then, say, he don't act like it. Act
like nothin', no...Ya don' hear 'im say nothin' about it. He
work, jus' like anybody else. But that man got a lot a sense.
He learnt me a lot a things, too, in the bushes, ya know, beside
what my grandfather learnt me, um-hum. Man, he carry me out t'
the woods, he say, "Miss Bessie-mun," he call me "Bessie-mun."
You know how them Geetchies call ya? "Miss Bessie-mun, this
here, here, you can take it an' hit, it's good for so-an'-so.
Hit'll do so-an'so. An' this'n..." he said to me one day in
the woods, said, ah, "The woods is jus' like a table." He said
it's just like God set the table, ya know? Fer da, da world, ya
know. Sin, righteous, an' wrong. Says, "Sumpin' here will kill
ya; an' sumpin' here will make you live." An' that was won'erful,
too. That was true. Sum'in' in the woods will kill you, an'
sum'in (something) in the woodsâ€™ll make you live. So that's the
way...
AL: He knew both of 'em?
BJ: Huh?
