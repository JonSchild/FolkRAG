Dear Mr. Whitlock -
Received your letter of the 17th and also the one
of the 12th. Was gone at the time so didnt get to
answer it.  There when the one of the 17th came, I
said I must answer it and tell you.  What I will
try and do one thing I live out of Smith Centro 18 miles
in the Country on a farm and it is not always 
easy for me to go into town and I have been
especially busy this last week.  However I will do as
you suggest as soon as I can tho best thing
would be for me to make a record of the song.
but as that would be difficult for me to do real
soon.  Just as soon as I possibly can I will
go to the Smith Centre music teacher and get
her to write it down for you as I sing the old tune.
it is the chorus they have changed more than the
verses.  I will do this as soon as I can under the
circumstances now it will be a few days before I can
get into town.  hope it will not inconvenience you as to the
delay.  Sincerely Mrs. E Womer
