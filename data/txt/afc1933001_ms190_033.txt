Dr. Willis L. James
Fort Valley Folk Festival
Fort Valley, Georgia

Dear Dr. James:

     A telegram came this morning from the Rosenwald
Foundation saying that they have not yet received your
application for a fellowship. I have been somewhat disturbed
that you have not written me about this matter and
now it seems that if the application is not in to them this
week, that it will have come too late. I hope you will see
your way to doing something about this at once.

     I saw Lewis Jones yesterday and he said that he
was going down to the Festival. I am going to be awfully 
sorry to miss it.

     Please give my kindest regards to Dr. Bond.

     Sincerely yours,

     Alan Lomax
     Division of Educational Services
