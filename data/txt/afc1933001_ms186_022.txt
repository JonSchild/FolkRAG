Doctor Louis V. Chappell
West Virginia University
Morgantown, West Virginia

Dear Doctor Chappell:

Since I left your delightful home in the early part of the summer,
I have been on the run continually, first giving two weeks of lectures
at the University of Indiana with little or no chance to prepare and
then plunging into an intensive field period in Mississippi and
Tennessee. I have just this moment come back to Washington and begun
to get my house in order. I hope you and Mrs. Chappell will accept
this apology for not having written before and allow me to express my 
appreciation for your hospitality and kindness to me.

I should very much like to hear whether in thinking it over you 
decided to follow out the plans we discussed, whether or not it would
now be possible to purchase groups of your records as you conclude 
their publication. I do not know, since our activities have been
reduced due to war-time pressure, whether we can still do this, but I 
should like to have the opportunity to submit the project for present
or future consideration. I am in particular concerned, however, with
the matter of the Rosenwald Fellowship we discussed. In the next ten 
days we plan to set up the whole project and should very  much like to
include you in it. If you are still interested, give me a notion of 
how much time you plan to spend in the field during a year beginning
in July 1943-1944, what results you would expect such a year to bring 
in terms of recordings and, roughly, how much you think such a year 
would cost you in terms of expenses. 

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Cordially yours,
