Sailors Songs - Cox
the lord above send down a dove
with wings as sharp as razors
To cut the throats of all the blokes
That served bad beer to sailors

On Poaching [underlined] & Van Dieman's Land (ST)
The real trouble is that there never should have been
anything like that at all. Things were sent into this
world free. They were all made for anybody These people
made laws up. That's why you can't get anywhere.
These peasants - they're as good for you as anybody else.
And they made the law up so you mustn't touch them
That's what caused people to poach. I think the world
was made for people to live in it, & why should these big
people have everything? You got to keep a going to get
them a living, & if it wasnt for the lower classes they
wouldn't have nothing. where would they be if the people
didin't keep a working the land, getting the shift for em?
They have to come out & do some theyself. They can ride
about in motor cars & you mustn't look. They have
everything, lower people have nothing. You ain't got a 
[?] of ground to walk on that's your own.
