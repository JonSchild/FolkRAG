Tape:  1312 cont.  Octa and Dion  5
Octa:  Just come in there like that.  Sometimes, I hear a singer
I catch it, it takes about a day after I hear it, I hear that
song so I can play it.  I don't care if it's a big orchestra
or a band or something like that, I can catch it like that.
A lot of songs I made, I was picking some cotton, it come in
me, I put them all togethr, and itwent like that.
AL:  Sing us a song you made up picking cotton. . . . . .
Octa:  Dixie Rambler special, I don't sing that. . . . . . . . It's 
a big thing to make a song and find out the words.  It's a lot
of things to have in your head, because in a dance, we can pl
about 6 different dances, you know, so you got to keep all the
it's alot.  Sometimes you can't do it.  And for along, long
time, they didn't sing at all, just a little whoooo.  That's
all, they don't sing.
AL:  And what about the man I hear who's called Amadie Ardoin
Do you know anything about him?
Octa:  Amadie Ardoin, he was a good player for a nigger, a
good player.  I had a tape here that's made in '29, and one
of my cousins had it, and he came here.  He said I went 2 or
places and I make him play and the one that recognize the tap
I give it to him.  Sohe came here, so I make him play just a 
little bit, I said, I know.  He says who?  I says Amadie
Ardoin.  WEll, he said, you got it, that's yours.
AL:  How could you tell?
Octa:  Because I remember.  I was a little kid.  He was older
then me.  I was a little kid and I rememberthe way he played.
