Arkansas nowadays is Rosie, sometimes Roxie. From Arkansas come this

AIN'T WORKIN' SONG

On the docks, at Mobile, Alabama, a collector of folk songs has
just recorded a song by a Negro longshoreman, Charley Campbell.
Collector: Was that a work song that you've just sung?
Charley: Boss, this here ain't no workin' song; it's ain't
workin' song!

When you're in prison, you can think up anything and go to
singing it. Got something on your mind, you know, and you go to
singing it. On Mondays--we call that 'Blue Monday'--you ain't
studyin' about singing. You know you got to go all that week. Don't
sing much in the mornin' 'cause you don't feel good. When you get
out there you'd be thinkin' bout home. Right after dinner, when they
bellies full, the boys don't want to talk or sing either; they're
feelin' lazy with their bellies full and that hot sun comin' down.
But you got to go anyhow. But late in the evenin', you know, and
along about Saturday, we'd sing. 'Long about Friday and Saturday; you
know the week is all about done, and, man, you go to singing then.
Down there, we call Saturday 'Christmas Eve' and Sunday 'Christmas'
'cause we know when Sunday comes we ain't gonna work.
--Louisiana Negro.--------------
