I noticed that the Dr. stayed out of reach.
Another naked approached us in a circle dragging herself
along on her knees through the shrine whining that she
was hungry- her dinner had just been served. Another
came moaning and weeping, her great belly thrust
out before her over her brush in an eternal and
unnatural psychic pregnancy.... In another place
a woman stood helplessly crying, begging to
go home to have her baby. This was genuine, the
varicose veins stood out in great knots on her
legs. With her close clipped head and her impersonal
merely human face she looked neither
woman except for her belly. When Dr. Reiser told
her he would send her home, she cried and reached
across her face to dash the tears from her  eyes
like a man. [or at boy] Just now a white and pitiful
boy sits at the table with him, trying to make conversation
with me. He is frightened and timid and
cowed and completely moon-calfish. I am so nervous
I can scarcely write as this scrawl witnesses.....
