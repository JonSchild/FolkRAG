2-Sam Bass

and he died the next day ,refusing to the last to give the names off his associates who
fled. His purse contained the last twenty dollar gold piece of his share of the Union [Fa]
Pacific Railway swag. His pistol and belt, now in the University of Texas Museum, still
holds the thirteen unshot cartridges found there at the close of the Round Rock battle.

Sam met hi[s]s fate at Round Rock, July the twenty-first,
They filled poor Sam with rifle balls and emptied out his purse
Some say he's got to Heaven, there's none of us can say;
But if I'm right in my surmise, he's gone the other way.

Sam Bass is buried in a lonely country graveyard near Round Rock. Some kindly
person has carved on his headstone, (The original tombstone has long ago been chipped
to pieces and carried away by curio hunters),- "Sam Bass died July 21, 1887, on his birthday,
aged 27." By his side a companion in the oobery who fell instantly in the fracas must
forever carry the obloquy of being "killed",as his headstone relates. Sam "died" the day
after the robbery. A well-beaten path leads to his grave seemingly yhe only grave frequently
visited in the cemetary. A "Sam Bass Cafe" in the town wins a large patronage,
and Round Rock, Texas, a prosperous village, is famous chiefly because Sam Bass, cowboy,
horse-racer, free spender, robber, lost his life in an attempt to rob its only bank.

As for the song, it sprang from the people. No one has ever claimed to be its
author. Its sources are as mysterious and unknown as the Texas grasses that grow above
his grave, rustling and whispering in the Texas Northers that sweep through them on long
wintry nights.

During cattle trail days in Texas, 1868-1892, every singing cowboy carried
Sam Bass in his repertoire. The tune is typically of the western ballad breed,- drawling,
whiney, creepy, saturated with gloom. Negroes classed it among their lonesome tunes.
My manuscript collection contains nearly forty versions of the words; all the tunes were
much alike. Once while lecturing at Coe College in Iowa, I referred to the Sam Bass story.
At the conclusion of the talk a freshman came up and said proudly: "I thought you might
be interested to know that my mother was a sister of Sam Bass!"
