MRS. DAVIS:
I said I could not waste up and do things, I always remember the things that he would tell me just like an open book like I said before. I could never forget it.
LARRY:
About this house. When I first come out here for the first time he told me he said Larry how you like my Rabbit Box.
MRS. DAVIS:
Thats the way he would always call it.
LARRY:
It made me feel good to be able to invite you to my Rabbit Box. (laughter) I said you all right Brother Davis.
MRS. DAVIS:
The first thing I say is why you always have to call your house a Rabbit box. He said well thats just my way of saying I don't mean no harm. I said I don't care who comes, you say Rabbit box, But that was always his word. My little Rabbit box. You didn't forget it huh Larry.
LARRY:
I ain't forgot nothing he tells me, and I feel things he told me I ain't even got around using yet.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yeah, you will.
LIONEL:
How did he earn the money for the house? Must have been a hard struggle.
