What did you hear?
There's plenty of sugar in this country.  This is just a way 
to scare us.  They just want us to know a war's going on.  
Well, I don't like it." 

Where? 
In a lunchroom in which I was eating lunch and after I had 
told the waitress to put in only one teaspoon of sugar I 
happened to remark that I used to use two, but to save sugar 
I was only using one now.  

When did you hear it? 
Yesterday noon.  

Who said it? 
The waitress 

To whom? 
To me. 

Kind of people? 
This was a lunchroom for working men.  The waitresses are pretty 
old because the young girls can get jobs in factories.  

Answer? 
I didn't say anything.  

Anything else? 
Nothing to report.
