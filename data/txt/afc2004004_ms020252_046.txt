2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 14   [*38*]

I GOT TO LIE DOWN

CHORUS: 
Lawd! I got to lie down,
How shall I rise? 
I got to lie down, 
How shall I rise?
I got to lie down, 
How shall I rise?
Standin' at the judgment bar.

(REPEAT CHORUS)

Watch your secret-keeper, 
The one that bringeth news, 
He will come in your house
An' bring you news, 
An' keep you all confused. (CHORUS)

Oh, preachers, be careful
What you do, 
The sinners are sayin'
They are as good as you. 

Now, preacher, don't be
No false pretense
'Cause God is tired
Of so much sin.
(CHORUS)

There's so many people
Walking' the streets, 
They have no respect
For the one they meet. 

Well, God is tired
Of so much sin, 
Gonna roll through the land
With storm and wind. 
(CHORUS)

(REPEAT CHORUS)
