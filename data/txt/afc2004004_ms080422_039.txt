Tim Code: Tape: #889 Nimrod Workman  1

Nimrod: . . . . . . . . I sung all over the world . . . . . I got back from
Van Couver and they called me the nest day to go to Memphis,
went down there to a place called Mud Island, and oh boy, we had a good one.  That song, I'll sing you a little bit of it. 
It's the oldest one in the world. (he sings)-Amazing Grace
"Now day is passed and gone.
Dying man shakes a car,
Then may we all remember well
the hour of death is here.
My brother
Revive the weak, confirm the strong,
and death turn sinners cold.
Bow head all children, hear my heart
Has made seem to burn
Dear Lord, a father to them be
And shield them from all wrong.
That they may know and be
And live . . . . . 
. . . . 
the hour she calls my love
how often [have] you looked for me
and ofttimes seen me come.
But now i must depart from you
To never more return
Let not this parting grieve your heart
. . . . . . . 
Remember you can quickly come to me 
where we shall part no more . . . . . 
Al: Tell us what that song meant to  mountain people.
Nimrod: That song was written back hundreds and hundreds of 
years ago. And that represented to the people and the way 
they felt about it . . . that song . . . a man and his wife was more
dear to him than anything. It's not like people is today.
