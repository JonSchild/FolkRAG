me 'cause I had been, up aroun' Fitzgerald, I had been nursin' the puppies?  You know, an' raisin' 'em up an' everything?  You know, my breas' would worry me sometime an' sometime I milk it off.  You know?  An' so an' he asked me, "Is you -- Some folks think you pregnant there."

I said, "No, I'm not pregnant.  I always had milk."

AL:  What?

BJ:  I -- He, he, he tought I was pregnant 'cause I was, you know, milkin' the milk off my breas'.  That was Dr. Welcher.  An' ah, so I told him, "No."  Said, " I always have had milk ever since I have a baby."

An' he just stunned hisse'f an' looked.

An' so, the next time he came out there he brought a book.  And showed me.  And read it to me.  Then read it. 

AL:  What did the book say?

BJ:  He told me I was a-milk-breasted.  He say that I, that I was -- He say very seldom that you find it.  A milk-breas' woman.  An' I'm milk-breasted.  An' he tell me a the good I could do, ya know, an' git jobs, ya know, in these places where they ain't no -- the babies ain't got no parents an' like that, an' peoples just give they babies away, you know, in the hospitals an' things?  Like that.  An' then he go on to tell me all about how babies would be -- Parents would git killed or die or, you know, sumpin' like that, an' don't have nobody to nurse 'em.  He said that, sometime don't have nobody to take ker of 'em an' give 'em away.  Give 'em away befo' they wa' bo'n.  He said the place was full a babies, from diffrunt places, you know, that would -- that need it.  Sumpin' like that.  An' they -- an', ah, human milk is the best milk for 'em, you know?
