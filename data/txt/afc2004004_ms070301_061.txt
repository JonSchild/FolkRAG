Balor Tale in Centin

Tor Mor - cliff jutting out
in the ocean.

Fin seduces daughter & 12 women.
When Balor's daughter throws the
halter she says - 

"Don't you know there is a
false cast to every woman's hand?
There is a crooked vein in my
arm & I could not help it

12 babies born - thorn
breaks - they fall into water & become
seals - 

"We don't care for the others
while we have him."
