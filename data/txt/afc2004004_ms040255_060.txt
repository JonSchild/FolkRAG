TRADITIONAL 
MUSIC 

IS A NEW MAGAZINE dealing with traditional music in 
England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 

The first issue, available now, has articles on: 
SOUTHERN ENGLISH COUNTRY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC, with 
full discography 
OXFORDSHIRE SINGERS and the influence of local concert 
parties in spreading traditional songs 
FRED KILROY, a great Oldham concertina player 
SAM LARNER, the famous singer of Winterton, Norfolk 
SINGERS FROM EAST SUFFOLK. 
Articles on PERCY WEBB, the great Suffolk singer, 
PADDY TAYLOR, pioneer figure in London Irish music, 
JIMMY POWER, and several other musicians and singers 
are in preparation for the next and later issues. 
Each issue features reviews if all the latest records, 
research news, and a series on street musicians. Many 
never before published photographs appear throughout. 

Our concern is with traditional music in performance 
rather than in isolation - interviews with musicians 
and singers are a prominent feature. 3 A4 size 32-page 
issues appear per year at 35p (45p by post). 
An annual subscription of £1.20 for 3 issues (inc. 
p&p) will thus be the easiest and cheapest way for 
most people to obtain the magazine. Our prices seem 
bound to increase soon, but all existing subscriptions 
will be honoured without extra payments. Why not take 
advantage of this by completing the form opposite and 
sending it off?
