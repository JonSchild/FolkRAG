recommend me and she knows the director, Embree, very well. That may prove
to be a good lead. I still, though, haven't stopped thinking about the CBS
things. That might be an awfully good place to be for a year. Do write about
what's up; I have to tell Father pretty soon what I want to do, and he's still
a little upset by my decision not to go to graduate school. The main things
I want to know are about Dave Taylor and whether or not it would be a good
idea to come to Washington to job-hunt. Otherwise, you see, if the CBS thing
falls through and it doesn't look like a trip to Washington would result in 
much, I probably would better stay right here and job-hunt xxxxxxx in Chicago
and not spend the money to come East.
Anyway, I love you, and I may be able to wangle a trip to Washington
out of Father just to see you before you head south. I haven't been able yet 
to get away from camp to go around and see your friends; one of the councillors
and I were going to spend three or four days doing that in her car on the 
way down to Chicago after camp, but it looks as though P. and D. are coming
up so we may have to rearrange our plans. Deanie has a Delta Gamma meeting
in Minneapolis on the nineteenth and Father may drive up with her. He wants 
very much that I should drive home with them.
I hope you are as brown as I am-- my nose peels and the flies bite
great lumps into me but I'm turning a beautiful sort of speckled coffee
color. It's nice, but, I should warn you, not very sophisticated; I don't
seem to tan that way. Give my love to the Seegers and I hope Corey is recovered.
Love to both,
Bess
