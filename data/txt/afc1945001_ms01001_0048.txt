overlook the possibilities of recruiting a rumor monger into the project in orderto be in a position so bridle his tongue.) Reliability, responsibility, a willingness to work anonymously, a willingness to proceed with routine tasks, an understanding of the importance of following distractions, the ability to remember, all are part of the personal qualifications necessary for a good rumor reporter. 

Rumors travel along social networks. It is important, therefore, that reporters be drawn from all networks of the community or from people who are in a position to observe such segments. In order to keep track of rumors among Negroes, it would be important to have Negro rumor reporters. However, in order to keep track of rumors among some of the wealthier circles, members of the hotel workers and bartenders and waiters unions might be recruited to supplement those within the group who would be willing to do the reporting. 

Once recruited, reporters should be given special training. First, they should be trained in detecting a rumor. Ideally, a rumor has three major aspects: (1) it is offered as a fact, not an opinion. (2) it carries the implications of a private, reliable source of information, one not available to the general public. (3) it has specific rather than a general reference. These three features distinguish rumors from all other forms of orally transmitted materials. It is often difficult to get a clear-cut expression in just so many words of all three phases of the rumor characteristics, but if one or two features are clearly presented and the others implied, then the communication should be considered a rumor. As soon as possible after the rumor has been heard, the reporters should write the rumor down word for word as it was given.
