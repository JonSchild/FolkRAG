Starvation in my kitchen, rent sign's on my do',
An' if I look down, stranger, can't see you at my home [any] mo mo'.

An' I got up this morning' just about the dawn of day,
Then I ain' got no job, I ain' got no place to stay.

Lord, I walked in a sto'I ain' got a dime,
I [asked for a dime this mornin'] the clerk don' pay me no min'.
say A dime a neckbones and
Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd,
Lawd, Lawd, mama, some ol' rainy day,
Me an' my luck gwine change an' I don' want to be treated thisaway.

[I'Say I don' want]
Lawd a bran' new skillet, gwine buy me a bran' new lid,
Say, I've got a bran' new sweetie, don' you know I need me a bran' 
new pistol.
