Another story is that the Government is confident the
war will be over within a year as proven by the "fact" that the
Federal Government would not enter into a contract of not more
than one year in duration, and that it is cancelling contracts
that have previously been awarded for a year or two in advance.
This latter story was noted August 4, 1942 by a University student
who overhead a conversation on a local street car. [*Los Angeles, Cal. 3*]
