PHILIPPE PICARD,  PRESIDENT

but for your letter (and Alan's 
urging) I shouldn't have replied 
to Mr. Wetherold's offer.  It is 
what the Negro convicts would 
call "Chinchy." The next step
would be to require a premium
for the advantage of 
working for a powerful
company.  I have told [Mr.]
Wetherold he can reach me 
at Niagara Falls Canada,
General Delivery, where we will
either travel west - south to Detroit
and Texas or head south for 
Washington [Canada].
Thank you for your 
patience and continued 
forbearance. Yours always, John A. Lomax
