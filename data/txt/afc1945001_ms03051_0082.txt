Knoxville, Tennessee

Oct 6. "It seems strange that no rumors mentioned about Blackberry Farm in the local news. I have a cousin in the East. She spoke of this news as being on the front page of her local paper. She spoke of the Farm as being connected with the Nazis and about the FBI investigation last summer and some suspects being taken to Washington. I understand the farm has not been operated for business recently, My sister went to Wisconsin this summer, while there the hostess told her of two very quiet women who were there a while from the Blackberry farm, Quite suddenly they left ahead of their schedule, with no explanation - before their paid up time had expired."
