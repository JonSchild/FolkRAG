Gede is no less a loa than other gods, "He is a zombi and is fed apart,"
and the Haitians say "The loa are like human beings.  They will not
mingle with the dead, and Gede is of the dead."  His color is black, and
Saturday is his sacred day.  He "eats" salt-herring, hot peppers, cassava,
roasted corn, roasted bananas, and other roasted foods.  He drinks clairin
--much of it--and at great ceremonies a black goat and chickens are killed
for him, as well as those chickens with ruffled feathers called djakati,
which in all the New World, as in Africa, are believed to discover and
dig up magic charms set against their owners.  He lives in the cemetery,
"behind the cross."  There are a number of deities whose names are com-
pounded with the name of Gede,-Gedenibo, Gedeonsu, Gedehun,-and hence the
question whether or not this is a generic term or a specific designation
is pertinent.  There is no agreement on this point, and it could only be
established that those loa who bear the same name, such as all Ogun or
Bosu or Simbi deities, are brothers; but who the parents of these groups
may have been is not known.

Associated with Simbi and Gede in the PÃ©tro "squad" are the
various forms of Bosu and 'Ti Kita.Some hold that Bosu lives in the
mountains and the cemeteries, but not in the water; others state that he
does not live in the mountains, but in the water and on the plain.  As
a matter of fact, there is a Bosu of the water, and there would also
seem to be one of the plain, of the cross-roads, and of the mountains,
each with its own name. 'Ti Kita , conceived as a woman, is also associated
with the cult of magic and the dead.  She is "fed" a goat, which is almost
invariably referred to as Maria Louisa, or Louisa.
