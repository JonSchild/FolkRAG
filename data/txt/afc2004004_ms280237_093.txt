Cox: They said, "We'll catch him." Put the coal on, you know, ans as soon
as the old fellow see the smoke go up, popping out there, he went home. He
didn't knw - the old farmer didn't know that. Course not, he wouldn't-a
been trapped like that. He want to catch him, had to catch him
first, you see. He can't do -- word of mouth ain't no use. You got to
catch 'em before you can do anything.
Lomax: And he really got him, did he?
Cox: He got him; he was there at his house when he got there. Course
he could set a fire on him, what he liked. Oh he'd pay; of course he would.
Lomax: And no more was said about it, eh?
Cox: Of course not. They dropped that then.
Lomax: How much did he make him pay, do you know?
Cox: O I don't know. He said that's hoe they catched the old fellow.
He see the smoke going out.
Lomax: But it worked theother way round sometimes. That is, some of 
the farm boys would go up when. . .
Cox: Oh yeah. Yeah, I know. That's. . . There was a blokeused to be about
there used to sing a song about this. I never did learn that one. 'Bout
somebody going along with an old woman, an old farmer's wife. He got onto
the bed or something an' he -- she was taken ill during the night. That
all came in the song. "Here's an apple on yonder tree, something from
Amerikke came in, then that, "You must have it love, says he, an' so I
must says she." That bloke, that come in, he had to go out, half the
time he was gone, he got out, you know. He was under the bed, you see,
and when this old farmer went to bed, the old woman turned up ill,
reckoned she wanted this apple. And the song went along, the different
parts; and when it got to this apple on yonder tree, this old fellow
says, "You must have it love, says he, yes, and so I must says she. He
went off to get the apple, you see, for her. Course, the time he was gone
was what the old woman had to get clear this other one. Time the old
farmer was gone - was gone after this apple, he had gone. That's how
the song kept going, you know. That went in all nice. Yeah.
Lomax: That's in old Boccaccio, isn't it, Peter? (Pause)
The Good Luck Ship:
1) Did you ever hear talk of a good luck ship,
Did you ever hear talk of the commander's name?
She's the Royal Rainbow from Bristol town,
And Captain Ramsgate was his name.
2) This good luck ship she was loaden deep,
Three anchors weighed all on her bow,
And the wind being East-North-East, my boys,
As close to the wind as she could lay.
