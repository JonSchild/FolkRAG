High School Sophmore - Negro - Female

I.
    I have heard in many places conversations 
of people on streetcars, buses etc. discussing 
about the War, they say they think 
the war will last for a couple of years and 
the way things are going so far they 
think our country might lose the 
war.

II  Hitler! Hitler
He's a coward, evil dog
He's trying to win our country
If he's tries
We'll slaughter him like a hog
