IT'S A GOOD THING

(Tune: It's a Long Way to Tipperary) 

It's a good thing to join a Union, 
It's a good thing to do.
It's a good thing to join a Union, 
It's the finest thing for you.
Good-bye, unfair wages, 
Farewell, long hours, too. 
It's a fine, fine thing to join a Union, 
For it will help you. 

It's a good thing to fight Child Labor, 
It's a good thing to do. 
It's a good thing to fight Child Labor, 
It's a splendid task for you.
Good-bye, childhood workers, 
Farewell, childhood's gloom. 
It's a fine, fine thing to fight Child Labor 
And save kids from doom.
