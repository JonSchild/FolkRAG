12) We lay close off round Holford Ness, 
When the wind backed round to the South-Sou'-West.

13) We reached our port all safe and sound,
And tied her up in Yarmouth town.

14) So after all our fears and alarms,
We all ended up in the Druid's Arms. 

Lomax: Wonderful, Bob ! Marvelous ! Give us one more
sea shantey to finish off this reel -- a short one.

Woman: Do Henry Martyn.

Robts: No it's too long. It won't go on.

Woman: O no, it won't , will it. 

Man: What about, "Leave her Johnny, leave her."

1) For the times are bad and wages are low,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her, 
I guess it's time for us to go,
It's time for us to leave her.

2) O the Liverpool Pat in his tarpaulin hat,
And Yankee John, the packet rat.

3) O don't you hear our old man say, 
Tomorrow you will get your pay.

4) O Mahogany beef and weevil bread,
We wish old Leatherface was dead.
