Rougish Man-2.

Mister Jim Mabie and Mister Prince told Jack,
Jack we are vexed,
You come and got the money,
Now we got to break your neck."

He says, "Yes, Mister Mabie, you and Mister Price,
You is on the track,
Run my hand in Miste Castle's trunk
Got his money sack.

Mister Jim Mabie told Jack, "Jack,
You don't tell us no tale.
Put you in this buggy,
For Senatoby jail."

Mister Jim Madie had Jack in the buggy,
Got near bout Strayhorn,
"Dtop here, Mister Madie,
Lemme steal you a feed of corn."

Laid old Jack in jail that time,
He didn't have nary friend,
Sentenced that poor boy
To five years in the pen.

He stayed in the pentenshuh,
Five years long,
Come back and say to Mister Castle,
"Can I stay here at home?"

Mister Castle wen to Miss Sue,
"Miss Sue, I'll tell you it's a sin,
I'm gonna let old Jack stay here
With us again."

Last one day Mister Castle
Goes out in the field
Jack goes down to his meal house
And steals all his meal.

Old Jack walk around the backyard
Say, "I got to have some fun ---
Went in Mister Castle's back room
And stole his clock and run.

Mr. Castle told Mr. Springfield,
"You 'port him, t'won't be no use,
Send old Jack to the Senatoby jail
And they'll turn old Jack aloose."

Jailer told Mr. Springfield,
We have fixed it so,
Jack done stole so much
Don't want him in the jailhouse no mo."
