MEMORANDUM
OFFICE OF THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS

August 30, 1940
To: Mr. Alan Lomax
       Honorary Curator
       Archive of American Folk Song
I have read your recommendations, which I am sending back
to you as you requested. How I feel about it will appear from
the attached copy of a letter to Evans Clark. It's a magnificent
job! Several notions occur to me in a quick reading of
your projected program. In connection with, "Our Singing
Country", or some other folk song program, I'd like to see a
straight reporting job done -- the reporter leaving the sound
truck, working his way up a narrow road to the old lady's
house, talking to her, getting her started, the song coming
out. For plain human interest, it would be hard to beat,
though I agree you could not do it too frequently. In connection
with the Nicholas Ray suggestion, which I think is a good
one, why not combine the forum and the forum critique technique
into one program, presenting in the middle at least three or
four dramatizations representing good earthy American points
of view wading into the professors. I think it could be made
an unusual interlude,
On your Latin American suggestion, again the roving
reporter idea appeals to me. Why not two big objective:
One, a Latin American moving around America with a sound truck,
making programs for Latin America -- and, incidentally, for us
too since nothing is more interesting than listening to talk
about yourself; the other with Latin America as the field.
The second would require a lot of money but I think money could
be found. Finally, as to your program of funny stories --
Congress must be full at any given time of Congressmen and
Senators with a raft of good human stories. It would please
the Congressmen to be asked to tell them and the result
might be pretty interesting from many points of view.
Thank you for all you are doing along this line. I want
you to know how much I appreciate it.
