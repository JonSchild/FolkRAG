Dear Alan:
     Arna Bontempts and I have been hearing about the Office
of Facts and Figures, and we've been wondering how one goes
about making an application for a writing job with the organization.
I've heard that Malcolm Cowley is in a position of authority,
and I've written him. I've also heard that the OFF is opening
a Chicago office. If you can give us any light on these questions,
both Bontemps and I will be mighty grateful.
     With best wishes,

Cordially, 
Jack Conroy
