Alan Lomax          Dr. Harold Spivacke -- Music

January 30, 1941

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

     Life moves so swiftly these days that one must depend 
on first impressions as the basis for action, perhaps, too
often. I feel sure, however, that Mr. Ishtiope Robertson is
not a charlatan, but a harmless and egotisticall careerist who
ascends by jumping from acquaintance to acquaintance, never
staying too long with any one, never concerned with solving
any problem. I sincerely hope that I will not have to assist
or in any other way work with Mr. Ishtiope Robertson. For
example: he spent the entire time that he was in my office
in attacking, superficially and ignorantly, all the studies
that have every been made of Indians in the United States and
all the scholars concerned with them.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
