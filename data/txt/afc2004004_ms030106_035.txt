3b 1646 a,2. I used to know the song but I found out it was best for me
yo forget it and that I did, in order to go along with the world on the
peaceful side.
? You don't remember any of it, not a word or one line.
M. Well, I don't remember the music at all. Well, there's a few words
that stated [that] R.C. was a paper man [had a] that sold papers by the market. that wouldn't be the
words exactly, and that he had some trouble with his wife
and the policeman wouldn't let him get his hat and on this

a white man seen a colored man, there was a fight -- or a colored man
seen a white man, there was a fight. All [because] for the trouble of R.C. The street cars had to stop. Transportation had absolutely quit. Abe Baldwin was a big promi-
nent factor in N.O. at the time. A. Baldwin , I believe was a great
ammunition dealer, considered one of the biggest in the world. He also
supposed to be connected as I understand with the big locomotive companies.
