F. S. of M. p. 201

(3) Old Blue treed; l went to see;
      There sat the possum on a simmon tree

(5) He grinned at me; I looked at him;
      I shook him out; Blue took him in.

(8) "Blue, what makes your eyes so red?"
      "I've run them 'possums till I'm about
      ded."

(10) O B died; I laid him in the
        shade,
        I dug his grave with a silver spade.

(11) I let him down with a golden chain;
        Link by link slipped through my hand

(12) There is only one thing that bothers my
        mind.
        Blue went to heaven and left me behind

(12) When I get there, first thing I'll do,
        Grab me a horn and blow for old Blue.
