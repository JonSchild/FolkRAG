RUBEN 

Willie Johnson, leader of the Golden Gate Quartet 
in New York City, told me he learned this off of a fellow 
named Long John, who used to play for breakdowns down in 
his home state of North Carolina, There are really a 
whole lot of verses and it tells a story about this 
Negro boy, Ruben, who got in trouble, slapped a white 
sheriff, and was chased through the swamps, with the hounds 
and people after him. They caught him, "got him down",
but not till he had run for many days and nights. They 
took him down to the jail, but he escaped, and came back home. 

So you see what it means when it says "When Ruben left 
home, he was a little bitty lad; when he came back he was 
a full grown man."
