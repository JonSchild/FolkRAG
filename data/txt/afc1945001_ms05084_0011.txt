2. Army appointments. "The way these doctors are being
pulled and hauled around is really a crime. The Army cries about
needed thousands more doctors and nurses than they can get, and
yet the red tape and delays and excuses are enough to keep any sane
doctor from enlisting. And there's a lot of real prejudice, too.

been given a commission and have closed their office--on the flim-
siest pretexts." (Heard in Denver, Colorado, August 5)  76
