1 - There were three men standing on a
corner.  Someone ask then what were
they standing there for.  One said,
"We heard that Hilter was coming
by here," so we are waiting to kill
him.  The other said, "I hope he is
still alive so we can kill him.

2 - Why does Hilter always carry a white
handkerchief?  In case he gets cold
feet & so he can surrender immediately.

3 - 1st Jap:  Did you know the Americans
                   are starving?
      2nd Jap:  No.  Why?
      1st Jap:  They must not have much
                     food because they are
                     eating chow now.
