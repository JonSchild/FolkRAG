I have just received a cordial
letter from Mr. David Stevens
of the Rockefeller foundation.
I think he would be interested
in seeing a typed advance copy of my
report, since he promises
early consideration of
our project. His summer
address is Box 44, Ephraim,
Wisconsin. Please tell him
that I requested you
to send on the manuscript.
