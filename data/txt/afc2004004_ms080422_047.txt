Nimrod: This song... I was reading in the bible, place where
Jesus was on the mountain. And there was three disciples,
he said can you watch with me one hour while I go to pray
at Getsemenhe. He came back and they was asleep. Second
time he came back they was asleep. Third time he came back
they was asleep. He said, the bible says, sleep on, and
he went to the garden of Getsemhene to pray. And I wrote
this song all the way from there to where they took him to
the cross and they gambled on his clothes, the bible says,
and I called it PASSING THROUGH THE GARDEN (he sings with
daughter Phyllis)
"While passing through this garden
A voice I hear, was a voice of wild suffering
That loved me so dear
Oh, he loved me so dear

"While passing through this garden
I asked him his name
He answered, I am Jesus
From Heaven I came
Oh, from Heaven I came.

I found him, lord Jesus
Upon that cold ground
The pain of his suffering
That no one has found
Oh, that no one has found.

They whipped him, beat him,
they thorn-crowned his head,
His raiments, all purple
showed blood stains of red
Oh, showed blood stains of red.

They whipped him, they beat him,
Placed spears in his side
And out of the spear holes
Ran water and blood
Oh, ran water and blood.

(AL asked them to repeat last 2 verses)
