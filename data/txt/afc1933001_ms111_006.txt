Dearest Shirley,
Of course we have all known for a long time that we were next on
Hitler's list, but we didn't suppose, or at least I didn't, that he would quit
his Russian job in the middle and turn his attention to us. He is smart to do it
before we are ready for him. And the Japs are smarter than I thought, outwitting
us and Britain all along the line so far. That doesn't mean that they will win
in the end, but I hate to think how many of our men and boys will have to be
sacrified, have already been sacrificed to our filly-dallying. My nephew has told
us in the family that they haven't had enough planes to get sufficient practice
even in landing on their carrier. Perhaps this is treason in these present circumstances, if so
please forget what I have said. I am certainly including me myself in my use of
"our", although I believe I'd be inclined to blame John L. Lewis more than any other
American,- or Madam Perkins. I notice that Miss Elliot has resigned here job and
gone back to her deaning. She is a fine person and did her job well in peace times,
but I think she is wise to give it up now, because a woman in such a position in these
present times is at a disadvantage; she has first to overcome men's prejudice against
a woman in authority, and we haven't time now for even that bit of delay.
Your letter came yesterday and your father and I have discussed it
to some extent. I don't know just what he will write you. Of course we should be
happy to have you around, and nothing would be better for your father's happiness than
for him to know that he could see you within short notice when he gets blue and lonesome
for you. And he seems more discouraged about his health than I have ever known
him to be. Just says, "the machinery is running down". I don't know whether he knows or suspects something that he won't tell me.
Yesterday he enrolled at the YMCA for exercises and rubbings, etc.  The hot baths seemed
to exhaust him and he slept nearly all afternoon; when he first lay down he was complaining
of his heart againg, and a tooth has given him considerable pain. He won't 
consent to having it pulled, because the dentist insists on pulling all of them at
the same time. I don't know what the solution is; I have suggested change of dentists.
The YMCA gave him a new diet sheet yesterday and he says he means to stick to it.
When he read it aloud to Mike and me, he paused at a sentence that suggested that
sugar and liquor could increase weight faster than any other items, and he said:
"I'm going to lay off whiskey; I know that isn't good for me." and he didn't take any
yesterday even though he told Mrs. Callaway on our recent visit that nothing relieved
him of heart pains except raw whiskey and he meant to take it. Maybe now that
he found that rest in bed relieved him yesterday, he will take that treatment instead.
At least I mean to try to encourage him in this. Two precautions we took yesterday: The YMCA has written Dr.
Neighbors for a report on your father before they prescribe further treatment;
and I wrote DR. Neighbors [himself]- myself asking for a report on your father's cardiograms.
I am not alarmed, but want to take all precautions possible.
All this has not kept me from [pthi]- taking thought of your family
problems. This morning's dveelopments make it pretty certain that Chris will not
be free again for some years to make  his own plans. You and Chris and his associates
can judge better than we what the immediate danger for Corpus Christi is. I don't
blame you for wanting to stay by Chris's side as long as you think it safe for the
children, even including Christmas when we had hoped to have all of you here. Follow
your own discretion and feelings there. As for your future plans if Chris is sent
away, My first impression was that you would be happier personally to take up your
residence again in Lubbock, where you already have a large group of friends and where
you can take up at least some modified form of your former social life. You have friends
here, of course, but you might find a repetition of your Corpus Christi experience
for a while at least. But if the war has prospects of running six or eight years,
you will have to consider which would be a more desirable place for the children to
