                     OFFICE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

                               OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To:               Mr. Eugene Katz                                       Date: Saturday 
                                                                                                  16 May 1942
From:          Edward Barnhart [*EB*]

Subject:       "Yardstick for Rumors"

                     In New York Thursday I communicated with Mr. Leigh White,
                     Columbia Broadcasting System, who informed that the film
                     had not arrived from Hollywood and the showing would not be
                     until the of next week.

                     He offered to send us a full report on the film as he is
                     turning in a report to the CBS on it. If you will drop
                     him a letter mentioning that I called and you want the
                     analysis he will send it to you I am sure.

                     In this way you would get a report before our analysts
                     in New York City see it when it is released for the trade.
