A bunch of new fellows that didn't know me.  (broken by Lomax)

So I finally got a job anyway away from this place - out in a 
section a kind of                 section - and they wanted some more
musicians.  Well, there wasn't an awful lotta musicians to pick from
outside of the piano, a guitar, mandolin and drums.  And the first
hot arrangements were made right along that time.  I picked up a 
clarinet out of a band, a brass band and a trumpet out of a brass band
and fixed up a good mandolin and myself and drums.  They were not hot
men, but Negroes.  Yes, they had music, most of them.
Q.  What did you write down for them?
M.  Well, I would write  down any kind of a tune at all - any kind of a tune.
I think there was a tune out "Crying just for you" just about that time
and that was one of the tunes.  All the popular tunes, I knew em and
we even jazzed at that time "Schnitzelbank" - a German tune because
we had to play that a lot and I made the arrangements for them things
because they didn't play em to suit me and I told em - if they
played what I had down on paper, they would be playing exactly as I
wanted em to play.
Q.  Well, where did you learn to write for a band?  You never played in any
band.
M.  O sure.  I'd been playing in bands all of my life.  My first instrument
was a guitar.  Then later I played drums.  I played what you called at
that time trap drums.  One man beat two drums -
Q.  But you didn't play in hot bands.
M.  O yes, it was rag time bands
Q.  Where did they play?
M. They played in New Orleans.  Lotta times in parades.  Of course they'd
have from 2 to 8 and 10 parades on Sundays.
