I really enjoyed it, jes to look at him.  An all the time after, the 
years an years I didn't see him an didn't hear from him, but my mind  
stayed on him all the time.  All the time, through my growing up in life, 
my mind stayed on that man.  Jes seein him.  Jes thought ab out the man.  
His face.  It was jus the won'erfulest face I ever looked at.  Huh-huh!  
From then on I'd jes think about him, an after I got grown, I saw him.  
I was married then.  I think I like the man I married, but still an 
all, my mind was still on Huddie.  i jes figured I wouldn't ever see

from my peoples.  Yeah.  You see, everybody move to theirsef when they

my sister was.  She was married.  I stayed with huh an huh husband.  I 
jes wouldn't be separated from my twin sister Mar y.  They jes couldn't 
separate us again then.  I went down to Shreveport an got a 
job an then she came.  After she an huh husband separated, then Mama 
kept the kids.  So we both worked right next do to each other.  We stayed 
there an worked.
