Mary's mother asked her one day; "What
are you doing with all this money
I give you everyweek; why you keep
me flying to the bank every day."
Mary replied, "Im buying war stamps;
they said to 'keep 'em flying.'"
"Keep em Flying"
"They're repling"
"Stop you signing"
"Start to buying"
War Stamps and bonds
A bond a day
Keeps the Japs away
Buy them today
that is the American way
A stamp a day
Is the better way
To say to Ray,
"I'm expecting you back
some day"
