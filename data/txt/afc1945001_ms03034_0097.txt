OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To: Mr. R. Keith Kane, Chief, Bureau of Intelligence   Date: October 15, 1942

From: Eugene Katz, Chief, Special Services Division

Subject: Letter from Dr. Allport, dated October 8th

Attached is a copy of a letter just received from Gordon 
Allport, in criticism of the Wartime Rumor Report.

I send it to you for your interest in Allport, rather 
than because of the importance I place upon the communication.

I believe that Allport's vested interest in the Boston
Rumor Clinic and in his own methods of combating rumor makes him 
somewhat less than partial and, further, that he did not have a 
proper understanding of the special purpose for which the rumor 
report was written:- [its] to interest [to] OWI in the study of this 
problem.

I have not sent it to members of the Planning Committee 
because I feel that much of his criticism is tangential.

[*--attached letter to be
sent Allport if you approve.*]
