Dear Mr. Lomax:

We are sending to you herewith the first
twenty galleys of text for COWBOY SONGS AND OTHER
FRONTIER BALLADS.

Will you please be sure to make your
corrections on the printer's marked set of proofs and
return this set with the manuscript.

We expect the first lot of music proofs by
Thursday and additional galleys of the text will be sent
to you tomorrow.  We shall send the music proofs to you
and you may send them on to the music editor for her
final approval.  Please caution her, however, to make
only the very necessary changes in this music as it is
quite expensive to reset and these changes, unless they
are typographical errors, must be charged as author's
alterations.

Very truly yours,
Susan S. Prink
