2nd R. of 10/12/61, B. J. Song 16

YOU BETTER MIND

You better mind how much you walk,
You better mind what you're walkin' about,
You got to give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.

CHORUS:
Yes, you better mind,
Oh, you better mind,
Oh, you got to give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.

You better mind how you sing,
You better mind what you're singin' about,
You got to give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.
(CHORUS)

Yes, you're goin' around here from do' to do',
You're talkin' about the things that you really don't know,
But you gonna give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.

Then, you're goin' around here from place to place,
They way you're livin', it's a real disgrace,
You're gonna give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.
(CHORUS)

Before that preacher baptizes you,
You know what you promised God you'd do,
And you gonna give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.
(CHORUS)
