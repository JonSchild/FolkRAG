Dear Alan:

Earlier today I wrote
to Bess that I was not sure
where we should be for the next
few days.
For three or four days
I've been having a tough time
as a result of taking, on Dr.
Calhouns orders, a medicine, sulfinilamide,
which was for me poisonous.
This afternoon I ended
three days of starving by buying
and having Miss Terrill cook
for me a delicious rare steak.
The eating thereof has given me
a fresh lease on life.
