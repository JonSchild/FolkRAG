come in peace.   I don't see nothin' they did wrong, [with it].   Ya see?   But
a lot of peoples does.   But I don't.   Because, you see, in this
place here, in the Bible, say, '"Eat, drink and be merry."   Ya
know?   All right.   An' then ya see where it say diffrunt kings,
diffrunt ones [has] had the big dance an' the big feast. 

[*(THE PRODIGAL SON)*]       
When the prodigal son went home, he was lost, you know what I mean? You know. An'
he was...had...an' he went home to his father an' he was, really
was out.   He was nekked an' hongry, bare feeted and tired, an'
everything, ya see?   An' the Lawd, an' his ah father met 'I'm an'
that's the way -- Now his father, now this interpretation of God,
ya see.   Tha's, that's what that was a parable of how Jeses would
do for ya.   How you can put out all you got, ya know.   [An' I] Just like I
[said] says to myse'f now, "I know the Lawd will bless me; I know the
Lawd this me."   I put out all to God. I'm gonna leave; I'm goin'
out.   I'm gonna go out here an', an' I -- I'm gonna sing the
blues an' other things for my living!   See what I  mean?   You git
out there an' fall, then ask God to take you back, see?   That's
the same as the prodigal son was, see?   He had put out all he had,
left his father an' everything, went out in a far country.   That's
what it means.   An' then, after he got there he -- All his money
was spent; he come to be broke.   An' fell; [an'] come to hisse'f.
See, there's so many peoples don't come to theyse'f, never.   Never
come to yourse'f.   Say, "This is me...My time now to do sumpin' for
myse'f."   See?   An' he come to hisse'f eating the hu's (husks), eatin',
eatin' with the hawgs, ya see.   An' ah, it says swine, it's hawg
also.   An' so, an' then he could see his father's house.   He could
see back there.   He could see jus' what -[- I could do it]
