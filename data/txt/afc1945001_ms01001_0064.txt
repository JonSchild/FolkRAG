          All material dealt with by a local rumor control project is to 
be considered "confidential" in the strict sense of the term.  Material 
should be released only through the project director, or as specifically
directed by him.  It should be recognized that rumors are choice conver-
sation pieces and give an individual an opportunity to show he is on the
inside and knows many things that others do not know.  He should be espe-
cially careful to avoid using his position in the project in this unwar-
ranted fashion.
          Where the need for guidance or aid is felt by an established
local rumor control project, remember that the Office of War Information
has been dealing with rumors on a national scale continuously.  If local
projects needs help with local rumors the OWI is in a position to provide
aid.
