and worry and things are about.
AL: You all bought the first victrola in town, didn't you?
Tell us about that.
Man: Well, it was 1936, and things was getting up there- making
10 cents an hour, something like that. My daddy went to town
and paid $36 for a radio and brought it home, and we lived--
in fact we lived 3 blocks from      Avenue and we got electricity-
we got a guy come down from Ward House, charged a dollar and
a quarter to wire the house, he run the wires up where you
could see 'em in the loft and we had a radio and then on Sat.
night on the street there- the whole street would come in
and we'd turn on the Grand Ole Opry, that's where I took up
my heart playing-- a colored man, the first one in the GOP,
name was D. Ford Bailey. at 10 o'clock, that's when the GOP
came on the radio, D. Ford Bailey would come on the GOP and he'd
play the T model or freight train race, or either the fox chasing.
And I was set up, I was real young, I would set up and I would
set up and listen to it, sometimes I couldn't make it, but
most times I would make it, I just loved the sound of the harp
and that's sort of where I picked it up, from him. But the
whole street there and on Saturdays when it'd be real hot, daddy
would make me go to the well and draw up a bucket of water and
run out there and pour it on the ground, before we had the radio
grounded, he thought that'd clear up the radio- he had all kind
of thing like.....but we'd do that and play the same way along
