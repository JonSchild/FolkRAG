Dear Jon:
Thanks for your good letter and the enthusiastic
report on the Sea Islanders.  They all were extremely
pleased about their appearance and you will be glad
to know we have already got an offer from Burton-
James Enterprises to book them throughout the area,
so you have done a great job for a good cause.
We all thank you.
Sincerely,
Alan Lomax
