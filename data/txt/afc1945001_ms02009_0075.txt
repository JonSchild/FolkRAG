repetition of rumors--even those based upon a fact known to the rumor-
teller--makes it easier for the enemy to obtain military information.

Direct Denial of Rumors
While the major responsibility of a rumor-control project
is to fill information gaps and to conduct an educational campaign
in careful thinking, it sometimes becomes necessary to refute specific
rumors with specific information. This involves many dangers, since
it means giving publicity to the rumor in an attempt to eliminate it.
Unless the rumor and its denial are presented with great care, much
more harm than good may result. The experience and surveys of the
Office of War Information lead to the following recommendations:
1. The stating of a rumor and its denial should only be
attempted in print; never over the radio.
2. In general, deny only those rumors which can be denied
flatly and conclusively.
3. Avoid printing rumors which can be denied only in
part, in partial detail, or in hedging language.
4. Rumors are colorful and interesting. Rumor denials
should be equally interesting. Some rumor columns
fail in their task because the rumors printed are
sensational, whereas the denials are dull. 
5. The catchy or "slogan" parts of a rumor should not
be printed; it is essential to "break up" the catchy,
quotable part of any rumor. The denial of the rumor
will not scotch the catchy or slogan part of the rumor,
which may win popularity (detached from the rumor), be-
cause it is highly quotable.
