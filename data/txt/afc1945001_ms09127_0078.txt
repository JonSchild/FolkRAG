One sailor who was once a oil man
asked his Buddie if he heard about
the three oil wells. 
The Buddie said no. 
Sailor:  Well; Well; Well! 

John in the Army said "There nothing
I wount'nt do for Fred.
Fred in the Navy said "There nothing
I wount'nt do for John.
There pals said "That what
I mean doing nothing for
each other. 

Poet to a sailor: 
High on the mountain 
Cool is the breeze 
Younger the couper
tigher the squeeze. 
But watch out for
The man dressed as a sailor
For everyone knows 
That they are wolves in favor.
