orchestrate the conditions of her performances in order to be
certain that everything moved in the direction she wanted—a
rhythm pattern that she wanted to be audible, for example, of
some particular effect achieved. She always wanted the music to be
"right." The last time I photographed her—only a short time before
her death—she insisted that we wait until the crowd around
her had dispersed before beginning; then she drew herself up and
put all of the energy she possessed into projecting the full force of
her personality through the lens. 
Bessie Jones was a brilliant and demanding teacher, and she left
us a priceless legacy.  She left us the wisdom of the ancestors.
But whatsoever it is, do what you can. You may not do what you want to, 
but do what you can. And I've always had it this way with myself. I asked
God for what I'm doing.  I asked God long before Lomax called me. I asked
the Lord for me to come out. I didn't know how I was coming out, when or
where, or who I was coming out with, but I wanted to come out and do
something because none of the people had left anything here. And I want
to leave—when the Lord takes me out of this body—I want to leave
something here of me. Fact is, I told the Lord, and I meant it, I never want
to die. I never, never want to die. When the world folds in, I want to be
here, in my work, in my doings, and with the people, among the people.
They don't see me but they can see of me. Now that's what I want to do.17

There is an inconsistency in the text here when Bessie calls Jet her mother's
father.  This contradicts what she has always said to me and the
statements in the text itself, pp. 4 and 7, where she clearly states that her
mother married James Sampson, and that is how Jet Sampson came to be
her grandfather.
