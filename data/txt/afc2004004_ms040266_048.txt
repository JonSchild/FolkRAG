Dear Mr. Lomax,
It is most kind of you to have
taken so much trouble over my request for
the song about The McCluskie - I am much
amused by it and am sure I can "edit" it
to the very slight extent necessary to make
it suitable for my youngsters (ages 10-15)
I have been trying to get you a
brochure about Galloway, to let you see the
sort of country the McCluskie came from -
but it is not the tourist season here just yet,
so I have ordered one and will send it to the
B.B.C. for you in token of my appreciation.
Should you ever go a-hunting folk tales
Galloway is rich in them, but it is not, I
fear rich in songs as some other counties -
