                     INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM

               


TO:           WILLIAM H. WEBBER, BUREAU OF INTELLIGENCE           DATE: 10/12/42

FROM:      FIELD REPRESENTATIVE, UTAH--REG

 SUBJECT: RUMOR REPORT DUE OCTOBER 10


         Attached hereto please find my rumor report due October 10. Since 
it was impossible for me to get my report under way before October 7, I have 
run it through Sunday, October 11 in order to obtain the full five-day coverage.
I think all of my assistants could do a better job if given a second opportunity. 
While their work is most cooperative, this study was, of course, new to each.

         My dentist is a man with approximately thirty days practice in Ogden, 
where his office is located in the First Security Bank Building, the city's 
finest. His practice is not confined to any one class as he has a full share of 
the working class along with the so-called social set. He is a man with high 
intelligence, who does a great deal of independent reading and thinking.
Mr. Spear had the pleasure of meeting this man and discovered that he was able 
to converse exceedingly well on many subjects.

         My Chamber of Commerce secretary is the Executive Secretary of the 
Ogden Chamber and a man who has a world of contacts, and is thoroughly familiar 
with all business and civic matters in northern Utah. He has held this position 
for several years and in addition is a member of the local draft board and 
secretary to the Associated Civic Clubs of Northern Utah.

         My beauty parlor operator is proprietor of one of the largest parlors 
in downtown Salt Lake City. Approximately ten operators are employed in this 
shop and the class of trade could best be described as "medium."

         My policeman is young and intelligent, with approximately two years 
service. He, however, walks the main beat in Salt Lake City and was selected 
more because of his ability to grasp the study than because of length of service.

         My druggist is long experienced in the trade. He has been operating 
his present well-stocked drug and prescription establishment for six years in 
one of the outlying neighborhoods in Salt Lake City. The neighborhood is a 
middle-class one, ranging from defense workers to moderately successful business 
men. This drug store is removed from nearby competition and, consequently, 
caters to the clientele of a heavily populated, one-mile radius.

         My labor union official is the young and active Representative of the 
United Steel Workers of America for Utah. His domain is principally Salt Lake 
County, which he covers thoroughly and frequently. He was a recent candidate 
for the state senate. In previous contacts I have found him well versed on 
labor and other problems.
