SPINAL MENINGITIS EPIDEMIC

Now people, you had better be careful,
You better watch as well as pray
God's working now in Harian,
That disease is coming this way

Chorus
God's working as he never before
You see the sign of his mighty hands
Wicked men and wicked women,
God's judgment is in this land.

Now you read in the book of Nahum
The third chapter and ninth verse,
The Ethiopians were carried away into captivity,
God's word it must be first.

Now, people, you ought to quit nagging,
And talking about your friends,
You had better get on the right side of God
And try to make amends.

That disease they said it started above Harlan,
But I declare it started from sin,
It's searching around the community,
It's killing both women and men.

That disease is called the meningitis,
When it comes you can't tell when;
It's attacking the wicked people,
That's carried away in sin.

They say in Harlan, Kentucky,
That some places are closed down
On account of the spinal Meningitis
That done quarantine the town.

Not only in Harlan, Kentucky,
It is in Jenkins, Kentucky, too,
It's even in Flatwoods, Viriginia,-
Oh people, what you going to do?

That spinal menigitis
Is at Pennington Gap and LaFollete, Tenn.,
It's searching the hills of McRoberts--
What will the consequences be?
