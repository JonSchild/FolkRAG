warmers and buck-passers will 
be vomited

I would go ahead and make 
this trip [save] as a gift to the 
Library of Congress save for these 
facts:
1. My income from stocks has 
been reduced until I am now 
borrowing from the Bank for 
running expenses.
2. By July, Mike will have 
to go and Miss Terrill and I - 
particularly Miss Terrill - will 
have to do the work of this place
3. If I sold some of my stock 
and made the trip on  [that] the proceeds, 
save you I don't think anyone would 
care a damn for my sacrifice.
So â€” I'll wait for directions about 
the machine and anything else.
As for your coming to see us,
rebrobate as you are but lovable,
reprobate as you can't help but being
we wait with Trembling and eager expectation.
Miss Terrill loves you even more than I do. Lovingly,  Father
