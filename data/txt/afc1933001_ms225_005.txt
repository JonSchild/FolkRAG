to make any estimate of this book,
for many years my favorite in 
certain moods, but I do think you
would enjoy the last syllable of
it. And, if you express a faint
desire - showing that you have
been able to read my letter - I'll
send along my copy to be
yours for good and all.

Mr. Weeks, the Atlantic Editor,
while he was here told me that
Mr. MacLeish would have an article
in the May Atlantic telling of
his plans and including mention
of your division. My poor
emasculated story of Will Hogg
is announced for the same
issue.
