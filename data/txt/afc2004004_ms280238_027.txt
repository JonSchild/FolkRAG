Mary Gillis: There were no toys at that time. Father used to give
me a post on his - - - - (gaelic word) ; do you know what a - - - -
is? his knee! (SINGS) And father used to take me on his knee, and 
she was jealous. Father used to make her jealous playing with me on
his knee! (SINGS.)
Annie Johnson: Well, I remember my mother telling us about a waulking
that your mother had, Mary -- and there was a crowd of Mingley men (?)
Storum Stade (?); and some were staying at your house; and when the 
first team of women was tired, your mother put up a team of these
Mingley men, and she said that she never heard nicer waulking songs
than these Mingley men. Relatives of your father, they were. And they
were my mother's uncles, you know. My granny was a P -------------,
and they were her --- my mother's relatives too, you see, and she was
saying you never heard such lovely singing as these men made.
Sandy McNeil: . . . . .They were working and singing so hard. . . .
Annie Johnson: And then the women were ashamed to take the third
round after the men. (GENERAL CHATTER AND LAUGHTER IN GAELIC.)
Lomax: Do you ever have waulking here any more in Barra?
Mary Gillis: Well, it's not long since we had waulking of blankets
mother did. The last one she did was when Mrs. Davis from America
was here -- you know, you've heard of her? Mary broke down the loom
and she was very silly!!
Mary McLoud: Mrs Davis died.
Mary Johnson: Did she?
Mrs Sandy MacNeil: Oh, did she died?
Mrs McLoud: She was very young. . .
Lomax: And what happened?
(THEY CHATTER? THEN RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL TOPIC. . . .)
Annie Johnson: . . . .Too much for the young folk.
Mary Gillis: Oh - they wouldn't do it! O bless your soul, they wouldn't!
Lomax: Do you think they worked too hard in the old days?
Mrs Sandy MacNeil: . . . . .had a horse and a pony. . .
Mary Gillis: O we couldn't have a horse in winter time, and we
couldn't have a horse going up to P --------------, to the hills.
