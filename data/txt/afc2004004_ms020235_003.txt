[*JOKE: The Country Girl who Feared Thunder & Lightening*]
BJ: When, ar , um, you know, these kak girls didn't go with no
mens at all. The man that married 'em had to jus', you know,
to raise up (?). An' um, hadn't been taught by no man. So, this
girl, she was, um, fine girl, way out in the sticks, country. Now
an' then would a boy go out there an' see 'er, an' she didn'
know nothin'.
    Preacher, he was a city slicker. An' he was a...you know.
An' they loved the preacher some of 'em; back in those days, the, what that
preacher say almost like what Papa say, ya know? An' they went
by that, ya know. They mind them preachers, long time ago.
And so, this preacher...
    This girl was so scared a thunder an' lightenin' 'till when
it started a cloud may come, she would run in the house an' hide.
A lot of peoples do that now, ya know, they scared. An' so, anyhow,
this girl was so scared. An' they was talkin'...Had a big dinner
out there one day, this preacher was talkin' to 'em. An' so, she
was tellin' 'im she wish he could jus' do sumpin' for her so not 
to be scared a thunder an' lightenin'.
    Said, "Why, that's easy. I kin stop her from bein' scared a
thunder an' lightenin' right away." Oh boy, that was all he wanted.
An' he set back there in his room. Finally...So he set that Sun-
day, for it to be.
     They worked hard an' got that girl in the nicest dress they
could git, [an' all] ya know, to go with this preacher, to ride with this
preacher that Sunday. Whatsoever he's goin' to teach her, to
show her not to be scared a thunder an' lightenin'. This fine
hoss an' buggy he had. An' they got a nicest, prettiest dress they
could get, to be with the preacher.
