Eliz: I just want to get an idea of the physical circumstances of your
life.  Now you live in an apartment in the Bronx.  You have a telephone.
People can call you up there when they want you to come and preach.  Do they
call you there sometimes and say --
Rev. D:  Yeah they call me. They call me sometimes.
Eliz:  Or you say that when you walk out of your house you may just bump
into someone.  Who would that be?  Who might ask you off for a week?
Rev. D:  What you say?
Eliz:  You say sometimes you meet someone who would take you away for a week
or so --
Rev. D:  Well!  Sometime it does happen like that.  Sometime I might meet up
wid some of the ministers pick me up an carry me in their car to some of
their churches.  Some of the various churches.  Do some kina service there
fur them.  See?  (He is yawning) I could not recall the name of the minister.
I have been costed sometimes.
Eliz:  There are really hundreds of churches up in Harlem and up in the
Bronx, aren't there?
Rev. D:  mmmmmm. . . .We have many a churches.
Eliz.  There are lots of small churches, aren't there?
Rev D.:  Some are small churches.
Eliz:  Some of them don't have a church building, do they?
Rev. D:  No. The biggest majority of em is stores.
Mrs. D:  Store Front.  A little mission they call it.
Eliz:  That's what I wanted to find out about.  That's very interesting.
Mrs. D:  Not many of em are able to afford a great large church like my
church but they have little stores, in little places like this, andyou
call em little missions.
Eliz:  They don't have a regular preacher because undoubtedly they couldn't 
afford to pay them?  Is that right?
Mrs. D:  Well they have regular preachers.  But what I mean is they don't get very much.
