(What can ever be done to remedy that?)
 Well... it takes prayer. Thass what it'll take.
 (Who is responsible for this injustice?)
 Well, fur me to try to tell ye, I'm scared I might give you the wrong answer, I couldn't altogether say. Because, you know, I tole you befo, there's so much you know I'm allowed to say, an so much I ain't allowed to say. The things you say, if you don't say what people want you to say to please them, you goin to lose your life. You got to say what they want you to say. An you bettah laugh when you say, like you're pleased. If you don't you'll git killed anyhow. Thass why I say, You can't do so much talk about nothin. I don't want nobody to knock on my do, come to kill me, 
and I don't know what it's all about. I always say, when I die, I want to know what I'm dying for. An as long as you got to walk on this earth anyhow, an ain't nobody wit you, it pay you not to do so much talkin. 
(What do you mean, you haven't got anyone with you?)
Nobody could identify what happened to you. Give an account of what happened to you. Many a body's been killed heah in this town, don't nobody know who did it. 
(Do you feel that the police would try to investigate if you were killed?)
That wouldn't do no good an I be dead.                       
(Don't the police make people more particular about whom they kill?)
They particular, but people know jes exactly what hours
