The war almost worse than the
last in certain respects.
The demand for men is worse 
and worse.
The war is like a game in which
each was playing fairly until
a big bully came along and
tried to be the whole show
by not tending to his own
business. Instead he tried
to tend to every body elses.
If he keeps it up, every body
else will tend to him.
