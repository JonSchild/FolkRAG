Soph. N. F.
(1) Gather scrap and slap a Jap.
(2) Negroes join the Marines and be mess boys.
(3) Buy Bones and never get it back.
(4) never will I be a WAAC'
The true reason is a fact
that Negro women who,
join the WAAC's
Are segretated on every hand
And, when on duty they serve
it's in the kitchen on a sack
Peeling potatoes like a good W.A.A.C.
(5) Saps are usually Japs
