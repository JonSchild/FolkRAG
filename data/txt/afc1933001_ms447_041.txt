"John Henry was a double-jinted man too. When he was a little boy,
he weighed twenty pounds, a newborn baby, and his limbs was just as fat
and stout--I had a picture of him, I know. I kept that picture a long time;
I believe it's down at the house now. He was layin' up there so fat and
stout. Even when he was a little baby he wanted to be a railroad man. He
was a steel driver, the best there ever was in the world. He was double-jinted
and he was a man with it. Always don't forget about John Henry
that he was a double-jinted man, had two jints to your one.
"Had a little wife named sweet Polly Ann, and John Henry got low
sick and he had malaria fever. And he was in the bed, doctor comin', an'
before Polly Ann would let the steel driving go she went out and drove
steel just like John Henry did. So every day she went out and drove steel
till John Henry got better so he could go back on the job.
--A LOUISIANA NEGRO.

You go ahead 'long, do the best you can,
That's the way yo' daddy died."

3  John Henry was a little boy,
And he was on his way to school,
Looked at the teacher and these words he said,
"I want to learn how to hamme  "
