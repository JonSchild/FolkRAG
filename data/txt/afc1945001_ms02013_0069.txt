7. "They're pushing this bond sales stuff too far.
People have their own plans for buying bonds and
stamps now, and as they push more sales of them on
people, they're dipping into cash they should use
for household purposes." (Wisconsin)

D. Recent buying of bonds because government wastes the money.

8. "We buy defense bonds and the money is being thrown
away paying defense workers high wages. And these
guys squander their money in beer joints." (Minn.)

9. "Fellows from Cudahy's and some of these big companies
around town say they won't buy bonds. Why should
they? Why should they give the Government money so
it can buy expensive cuts of meat for the soldiers
and other food and materials to be wasted in the 
defense program. Tons of food are just thrown away
in the army camps, all over. The food in some places
isn't cooked fit to eat and it has to be hauled away." 
(Utah)

E. Bonds won't be paid off.

10. "I'm buying whiskey with my money. That gives the 
Government a big revenue and they don't have to pay 
me back anything ten years from now. They're not 
going to pay off the principal on war bonds let
alone the interest. I'll take the whiskey, it's more
patriotic." (Utah)

11. "Why, the Government will never be able to pay off
all these war bonds in ten years. It's impossible.
I hear they will be extended another ten years."
(Utah)

12. "Did you know that these Defense Bonds we are being
asked to buy are not going to be paid back in cash
in ten years? They're really going to be refunded at
a lower rate of interest." (Oklahoma)

13. "War bonds will never be paid." (Connecticut)

14. "In two different instances I have heard references
made to the possibility of the Government 'writing-off'
its obligations represented by the War Bonds and crediting 
the individuals with whatever amount was involved
as their patriotic contribution to the 'all-out'
effort. Something should be done to neutralize the 
effect of such rumors and reassure the public of the 
stability of the Bonds." (Ohio)
