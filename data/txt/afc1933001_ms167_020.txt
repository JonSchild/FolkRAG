Subject: Introduction of Mr. Alan Lomax.
To: The Commandant, Engineer School, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

1. This will introduce to you Mr. Alan Lomax of the
Music Division of the Library of Congress.

2. Mr. Lomax is interested in ascertaining the type of
songs which soldiers of your command are singing and particularly
whether or not they are singing songs which they themselves have
composed. The work which he is doing is in connection with the
gathering together of folk music.

3. It may be that Mr. Lomax may request of you a small
group of soldiers to appear at a gathering at the White House within
the next week or two. In the event that is the case, you are
authorized to meet his request.

By order of the Secretary of War.
H.H. Pfeil
