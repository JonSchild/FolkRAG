Dear Alan,
Thanks for your note about this morning's broadcast
but I only got to see it after the broadcast was all over.
I'll watch for the next one.
Some time ago, I sent Paul Robeson a copy of that
Tennessee song of mine. I used to know him in New York years
ago and when I saw him there this summer I asked him if he
would mind looking at this thing and telling me what, if
anything, to do about it. I haven't heard from him since.
If you bang into him you might jog his memory. I haven't any
idea that he would do anything with it, but I thought if he
liked it, he might give it a plug somewhere. I have the copyright
on it now.
Give me a ring when you come to town some time.
Regards,
Mike(?) Ross
