Dear Allan:
Just a line to say hello and hope you are enjoying 
life fine. You remember some time ago I talked with you 
about making some records, and appreciate what you done for 
me with Prescott. But in search for bigger game, landed 
with King Record Company, . But not satisfied with them.

Am not getting the deal I got with Victory. Would 
like you to recommend me to another big Company, DECCa
Capitol, etc; If they are interested can send them some of 
my material. Maybe you can help me land a contract with 
one of them. I am not under contract with King...right now Although I have a contract to sign with them, but their is a few things we didn't get together on.

If you think this can be swung with a major company 
let me hear from you. Will do all I can to make a good 
artist for them,.

Yours truly,

Wade Mainer
