Lomax: But in all these songs it looks like the girls laid down
pretty willing.
Cox: Yes, looks like how you hear. But I never took that much
notice when I was young.
Lomax: But when you were going courting yourself, you must
have thought about it.
Harry laughs. . . . . . .

same tape: CHARLIE WILLS.

Derby Ram:
1) When I went up to London town upon a market day,
The first ram that I did see was ever fed be hay.
To me hi-diddle-um-derby,
Hi-diddle-um-day,
To me hi-diddle-um-darby,
Upon a market day,

2) The horns growed on his head, sir, they growed so high & tall,
A man went up in January and he didn't come down till June.

3) The wool growed on his back, sir, it growed so thick & round,
If you'll believe my story, it covered nine acres of ground.

4) The butcher that killed the ram, sir, was up to his knees in blood,
There was five and twenty butcher boys got washed away in the flood.

5) Took all the dogs in England to pull away his bones,
And all the women in England to roll away his pendylums.

6) Now the feller that owned the ram, sir, he must have been very rich,
And the feller that singed ghe song, sir's a lying son-of-a-bitch.

Lomax: Charlie, where did you used to sing the song?
Wills: O, in public houses, that's all. We used to have songs
pretty near every Saturday night in pubs.
Lomax: What was your favorite pub when you were a young man?
Wills: O dear. There was - where I was born and bided till I
was 19 years old - was the Half Moon and the New Inn.
Lomax: And singing going on down there?
Wills: Then when I got big enough to run after skirts - The
Volunteer and the Crook Hand. Three miles there and three miles
to come  back.
