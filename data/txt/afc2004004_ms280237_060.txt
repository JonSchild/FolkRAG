love? (pause)
Cox: Oh, I don't - I don't know. (pause) Well, a few times,
you know, you got to do such things as that. You mustn't be
quick - too fast as all that.
Lomax: Was she in love with you, Harry, from the first?
Cox: Yes, I think so.
Lomax: You were a fairly handsome fellow weren't you, in your
young days. You were a good looking man. . . .
Cox: Oh, I don't know how I looked. I . . . .
Lomax: I mean, didn't they consider you a very good looking
boy, the. . .
Cox: Oh, I weren't ugly. When I had my teet, my proper teeth in
I was different to what I am now. In my younger times, course I
was round, you know, more. (pause)
Lomax: You've got strong hands. Big powerful hands. . .
Cox: No I haven't, very big. I can - I have lifted some
weight though               They'll do all I got to do, at
present.
Lomax: And how many children did you have in your married life?
Cox: Three.
Lomax: How did you start out? I mean, did you have a tough time
at the beginning? Did you have a good house? And was she a good
cook? Tell me a little bit about. . .
Cox: Oh, yes, she was a good cook. She was  a dressmaker too.
Make anything. I used to have all my things made at home. Nearly
everything I had. Trousers, stockins, shirts, everything Nellie
made - jackets and all. I never did go to buy nothin' while she
was alive. Cook anything. An' make anything. Knit anything.
