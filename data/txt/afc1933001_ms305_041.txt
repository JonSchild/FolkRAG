Protest . .
Continued from front inside cover

Early last September, while the
New York City Federal Writers'
Project was undergoing reorganization
and transfer to local WPA administration,
the Project received a
virtually new supervisory staff and
some 18 pounds of mimeographed instructions
- the new "Manual of Procedure."
Much of this voluminous 
guide was phrased in the obscure and
roundabout language that is intelligible
only to expert purveyors of red
tape, but one of the instructions
therein caused the incumbent supervisory
staff some amusement as well 
as considerable annoyance. From
now on - the manual said - all interoffice
memoranda must be prefaced 
by "thought starters." For the information
of those not familiar with 
this refinement of office procedure,
"thought starters" are bromides of
the "bird-in-the-hand-is-worth-two-in-
the-bush" variety.

Had the incumbent supervisors remained
on the job, it is quite possible
that they would have turned out
some thought-starters that were not
so bromidic. For their thoughts at
this time were somewhat less than fit
to print.

There was, to be sure, some justificaiton
for their feelings. Some
months before, the Woodrum Committee
investigating WPA had invaded
the Writers' Project with a
squad of professional snoopers under
the direction of H. Ralph Burton.
Although Mr. Burton's instructions
were to investigate all aspects of the
Project - to reveal its accomplishments
as well as its shortcomings -
it was soon evident that he was interested
in only one task: to discredit
the Project in every possible way
and thus justify its abolition.

In pursuing this design, Mr. Burton
used the tactics he had learned
as investigator and counsel for several
patrioteering societies. The investigation
immediately degenerated 
into a hunt for Communists and Communist
influence. Step by step Mr.
Burton went over the same ground
that had been covered by the Dies
Committee in a previous investigation.
Manuscripts were seized and 
vainly searched for evidence of Moscow
propaganda. Testimony was
heard from disgruntled former employees,
persons with political axes

to grind, and witnesses who could
only be described as irresponsible
crackpots. A fantastic collection of
distortions, misrepresentations, and
plain lies were assembled and duly
inserted into the official record of the
hearings. Not one hint of the Project's
many accomplishments was allowed
to creep in. Not one member
of the Project administration was allowed
to testify. Not one word of
testimony in refutation of the obviously
embittered - and occasionally
incoherent - witnesses was permitted.

Thus, Mr. Burton almost succeeded
in killing the Writers' Project - as
he did succeed in killing the Federal
Theatre Project. Almost, but not
quite. For certain influential friends
of the Project refused to stand by
and witness the shameful performance
without a protest. Letters and
telegrams from well-known writers,
publishers, printers, and booksellers
began to pour in on Congressmen.
Forty-four of the leading publishing
houses in the country released a joint
letter, praising the Project for its
achievements and stating that in their
opinion the affairs of the Project had
been conducted with considerable efficiency.
Besides, it was evident to anyone
who read the book sections of 
leading newspapers and magazines,
that the Writers' Project, not only in
New York but throughout the country,
was making a real contribution
to American literature. Books were
being issued with increasing frequency,
and almost universally they
were receiving the enthusiastic endorsement
of the best critics.

In the face of such unimpeachable
support it was deemed inadvisable
to abolish the Project entirely. It was
allowed to continue - but under local
rather than Federal administration.

No one, from the start, had any
illusions about how the Project
would function under local administration.
In the first place, it was no
secret that Colonel Brehon B. Somervell,
WPA administrator for New
York City, had no love for the Project.
He had, in fact, let it be known
somewhat prematurely that as soon
as the Project was under his jurisdiction
it would be abolished. That it
was not abolished is not his fault.
But besides this personal factor, it
was generally felt that the local administration
would be neither technically
nor temperamentally qualified
to operate a cultural Project.
Proof of this was forthcoming even
before the transfer took place. There

was no such thing as questioning an
order - regardless of how impractical
it might be. To all objections raised
on technical grounds by the old administration,
Colonal Somervell's yesmen
shook their heads gravely and
gave a stereotyped answer: "Can't
help it - it will have to be done this
way. Those are orders. Remember - 
you're in the Army now."

The results of the first six-weeks'
operation of the Project under local
administration have amply justified
the fears of those who said it wouldn't
work. Much of the best work
which was in process of completion
has been unceremoniously scrapped.
Today the Project is hopelessly
snarled in red tape and groaning under
the weight of 18-pound manuals
of procedure. The supervisors who
are left hardly have time to dash off
thought-starters.

There aren't many supervisors left.
Some of the ranking supervisors
handed in their resignations when
they found that the new administration
showed little understanding of,
or sympathy for, the technical problems
involved in getting out books of
recognizable literary merit. All but a
few of the others were fired without
any notice whatever, and without
even being consulted about the books
they had in preparation. The entire
personnel of the Project was cut
from 370 to 150, in spite of the fact
that Washington had approved a 
quota of 370.

Worst of all, broken-down political
wheel horses are finding their way
into responsible supervisory positions.
Those whose testimony before
the Woodrum Committee was instrumental
in smearing the Project are
also being rewarded. Naturally, the
workers remaining on the Project resent
this obvious pay-off for what
they regard as a very dirty piece of
business. As long as known stool
pigeons remain in positions of authority,
it is futile to expect that harmonious
relations can exist between
the Project administration and the
workers. And without such harmonious
relations it is going to be impossible
to get out books that will
justify the continuation of the
Project.

This ought to be sufficiently clear
to Colonel Somervall, and undoubtedly
it is. Very likely he has his own
reasons for handling the situation as
he has. After all, he did say that he
was going to abolish the Writers'
Project.
