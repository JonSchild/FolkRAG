BJ TAPE 43, p. 26

God.  "Why couldn't he talk to me?"  He didn't ask to
to talk to 'im, jus' sent out; sent his servant out there.  God
has it (?) the same way, ya see.  Ya see, He send the peoples to 
tell ya.  He don't come down here an' tell ya Hisself.
    But, after all, he told him.  Then he started on back, an'
not ta go.  Say, "I, ah, I have mens at home, where we live at,"
you know, "Coulda told me that."  That the way he said it,
what he meant (?).  (BIBLE SAYS:  BEHOLD, I THOUGHT:  HE WILL
SURELY COME OUT TO ME, AND STAND, AND CALL ON THE NAME OF THE
LORD HIS GOD, AND WAVE HIS HAND OVER THE PLACE, AND RECOVER THE
LEPER.  ARE NOT AMANAH AND PHARPAR, THE RIVERS OF DAMASCUS, BETTER
THAN ALL THE WATERS OF ISRAEEL?  MAY I NOT WASH IN THEM, AND BE
CLEAN?)
     And his servant say, "Well, if he told you that, if he
told his servant to say that," said, "Why not do it?"  So this
servant kep' on after him to obey the servant.  That what we
have to do today. ______________________________________ what we have
to do,  An' he did.  He went on down there.  An' he dipped seven
times.  An' he come up the 7th time, he was healed.
     So?  He went to Elisha again, an' called 'im.  An' tol' 'im
he want -- asked him what's the price.  He had what he want, to pay him,
ya know.  'Cause he was healed; he was glad of it, ya see.  Elisha
didn't charge 'im anything.  Elisha told 'im to  himself, told
him he didn't charge him anything.  An' told his servant that,
not now.
     But one of the servants -- see why God fix things; just
like Judas; that was representin' Judas right there -- one of
the servants, he, he musta not a-been white, God pricked his
heart.  See, he had to be dark, 'cause Elisha didn't do it.
