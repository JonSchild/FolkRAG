and this aunt Mrs. Barr when she gets some
more articles on this song she sends them
on to the Kelly man so that he may know.
Some clubs over the state have been putting
forth an effort in makeing this our State
Song and some day it will no doubt
go through and be settled and we well
have this favorite song, as our State Song.
I just wanted to let you know how we appreciate
your interest in the song and in coming out
here to Kansas and Smith Co. to get facts
about it all.  I know it must have been work
but still a pleasure to know about some of
the places that this song was written about
Mrs. Sam Wagner of Smith Center is a sister. I also
have a sister Mrs Lute Zimmerin of Liberal Kans-
a brother (who is very much interested in the song)
liveing in Milwaukee - and out in Kans City.

Thanking you once again I am

Respectfully
Mrs. Emmet Womer
Bellaire
