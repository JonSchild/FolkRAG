The object of my affection
Old Black Joe
Old Spinning Wheel
O Susannah
Rainbow Round my Shoulder
She'll be coming round the Mountain
Sitting on Top of the World
Stormy Weather
Sunny Boy
Sweet Sue
The Man I love
Sweet Jennie Lee
The Johnson Gals
When  you and I were young Maggie
Yesterday


                 Hymns

Amazing Grace
Bless be the Tie that Binds
Father I stretch my Hand to Thee
How I love Jesus
I'm sending up my timber
My Jesus I love Thee
The Old ship of Zion


                   Spirituals

Ain't going to study war no more
Come along Little Children
Death's Black Train is coming
Done got Religion at last
Go down Moses
I'm gong Home on the Moring Train
I shall not be moved
If I could my Mother pray a gain
In that great Gitting-up Morning
Listen to the Lambs
Mary Martha, in the Garden
Nobody knows the trouble I see
O Mary don't you weep
O didn't it rain
O Freedom
Roll Jordan Roll
Standing in the need of Prayer
Steal Away
There's a Great Camp Meeting
Wade in the Water
