PAROLDY FIELD ARTILLERY SONG
1. 
Over hill, over dale, motorized from head
to tail,
With the caisoons and hosses all gone.
Stop to fix up a flat, or to get the
captain's hat.
Motor trucks with the pieces hooked on.
CHORUS
Then it's high, high see! the Field Artillery,
Sound off your Klaxon loud and strong!
(SQUAWK, SQUAWK!)
No more we'll go, with a team in low,
If our motors keep buzzin' along.

2.
See the red guidon stuck on the off side of 
a truck,
With the caissons and hosses all gone.
Gone are nose bags and grass, as we feed 
with oil and gas,
Motor trucks with the pieces hooked on.
CHORUS

3.
Hear the bold bugles blow (amplified by 
radio),
With the caissons and hosses all gone.
Shove 'er, guy into high, as the green lights
flicker by.
Motor trucks with the pieces hooked on. 
CHORUS
4.
If our engines go dead, won't our faces
all get red!
With the caissons and hosses all gone.
For the foemen, of course, will yell at us,
"Get a horse!"
Motor trucks with the pieces hooked on. 
CHORUS

II
WE ARE THE ENGINEERS
1.
We are the Engineers
We build the bridges and we
have no fears,
We come from near and far,
no branch of Service
Can ever swerve us,
In modest thought we say that
you deserve us.

2.
The Engineers,
From ponton units to the
camofleers,
In truth we say that, 
It's a soldier's occupation.
This chance to serve our 
nation.
We're the fighting Engineers.

ON BRAVE OLD ARMY TEAM
On brave old Army Team
On to the fray,
Fight on to victory,
For that's the fearless
Army way!
(West Point Football Song)
