RED RIVER SHORE
At the foot of yon mountain, where the founatin doth flow
The greatest creation, where the soft wind doth blow
There lived a fair maiden; she's the one I adore,
She's the one I will marry on the Red River Shore.
I spoke to her kindly, saying "Will you marry me?"
"My fortune's not great." "No Matter," said she.
"Your beauty's a-plenty, your'e the one I adore; 
Your'e the one I will marry on the Red River Shore."
I asked her old father if he'd give her to me. 
"No sir, she shan't marry no cowboy," said he.

So I jumped on my bronco and away I did ride.
A-leaving my true love on the Red River side. 
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
And in this letter these words you could find:
"Come back to be darling, your'e the one I adore.
Your'e the one I would marry on the Red River Shore."
So I jumped on my bronco and away I did ride
To marry my true love on the Red River side.
But her dad knew the secret and with twenty and four
Came to fight this young cowboy on the Red River Shore.
I drew my six*shooter, spun round and round
Till six men were wounded and sven were down.
No use for an army of twenty and four;
I'm bound for my true love on the Red River Shore.
Such is the fortune of all womenkind,
They are always controlled, they are always made mind;
Controlled by their parents until they become wives,
And slaves of their husbands the rest of their lives.
