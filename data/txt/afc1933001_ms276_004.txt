HELP PRESERVE PEACE

The movement for a boycott of
Japanese goods in the U.S., supported
by labor and consumer
groups, by churches, women's
clubs, peace societies and universities
in all parts of the country,
has acquired unique distinction
in receiving the support of
both advocates of international
sanctions and isolationists as
one of the few remaining weapons
against aggression which is at the
same time pacific and effective.
The people know that the hardships
imposed by its means are
nothing to those caused by the
war against which it is directed.

The invasion of China is being
made possible by the assistance
of the American people, and it
can be stopped by the same means,
because:

(1) We are Japan's largest export
market, taking 86 per cent
of her silk and 80 per cent of
green tea, while 97 per cent of
the silk used in this country in
recent years comes from Japan.

(2) 32 per cent of Japan's imports
come from the U.S., including
much of her raw materials
(not food) and war supplies.

(3) Exports buy imports.

An aroused public opinion is rapidly
seizing upon the boycott as
a traditional American weapon against
injustice, a weapon which 
was first used in early colonial
days. Already it has surpassed 
the anti-Nazi boycott of 1933.
DON'T BUY ARTICLES "MADE
IN JAPAN." Write to the Washington 
Labor Peace Committee (1440
Chapin St. N.W.) or the League of
Women Shoppers of the District of
Columbia for guides to satisfactory
substitutions.
