3. To respect collective bargaining
obligations and responsibilities.

4. To secure legislation
safeguarding the "economic security"
and social welfare" of
the Workers of America, to 
protect and extend our democratic
institutions and civil
rights and liberties, and thus 
to perpetuate the cherished 
traditions of our democracy."

The Position on Unity

"The CIO states with finality
that there can be no
compromise with its fundamental
purpose and aim of organizing
workers into powerful industrial
unions, nor with its
obligation to fully protect
the rights and interests of
all its members and affiliated
organizations. The CIO accepts
the goal of unity in the
labor movement and declares
that any program for the attainment
of such goal must embrace
as an essential prelude 
these fundamental purposes and principles."

The Resolutions

The resolutions approved
by the convention covered a
wide-range of subjects. They
pointed towards a broadening
of the government's activities
in behalf of the common people
called for a permanent Senate
Civil Liberties Committee,
condemned the use of the national
guard against labor in
strike situations and threatened
a boycott against Henry 
Ford unless he reaches an
agreement with the United
Automobile Workers. The Ford
is the only car on the market
that is not made by union labor.
"Henry Ford," said Richard
Frankenstein, "is a V-8
industrialist, and a Model-T
sociologist.

The south

They called for a strengthening
of democratic resistence
to fascism and dictatorship,
made provisions for a southern
CIO conference to initiate an
intensified organizing campaign
in that area, pledged
the CIO to strict observance
of contractual relations, and
uncompromising opposition to
any form of discrimination,
whether based upon race, color,
creed, or nationality.

One of the most dramatic
incidents during the convention
came when the delegates
dedicated two minutes of silence
to the 10 victims of the
Chicago Memorial Day Massacre.

D.C. LIBRARY ASSOCIATION TO
HEAR JAY ALLEN ON SPAIN

A new spirit has entered 
into the programs of the District
of Columbia Library Association.
World affairs seem 
to be the keynote this season.
At the last meeting Dr. Tansill
spoke on the foreign policy
of the United States during 
the World War. His thesis
that our State Department
functioned as an adjunct of
the famous Downing Street address,
bristled with facts and
proofs.

On Thursday, December 8
at 8 P.M. the second meeting
of the season offers the famous
foreign correspondent of
the Chicago Daily News, Jay
Allen, on the subject: THE 
SITUATION IN SPAIN IN THE
LIGHT OF THE MUNICH PACT. The
meeting will be held in the 
National Archives Building.
Mr. Allen knows Spain intimately
and whose who have 
heard him or read his correspondence
will allow nothing to 
keep them away from the Archives
auditorium Dec. 8.
