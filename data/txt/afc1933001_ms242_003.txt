As soon as you make up your
mind, shoot me a wire.

Bess writes that she'll be
at Camp Keshawa until
Aug. 29.

I am glad that you
cared to come by to
see, and it's fine to see
you full of vigor and
reflecting your good
physical condition by
putting on more flesh -
becoming potely like your
father.
Lovingly
