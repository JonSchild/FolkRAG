Dear Charley,

This Folklore Institute has been great fun and very
stimulating. I'll tell you all about it when I see you.
In the meantime, however, here is the outline work presented 
by Mrs. Jakobson, the Czech lady whom we interviewed
one afternoon in your library. At the time you said that
the anthropology committee might be interested in this
project. I have written her that I have sent you her
letter for your consideration. I also wish that you would 
show it to Dr. Spivacke, when it is convenient. 

With my best love to you, Ruth and the children.
Alan
