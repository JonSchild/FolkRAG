Dear Rae,
     Would you be kind enough to convey my thanks to
George Korson for his kindness in trying to help me locate
Joe Brow's Coal Mine and my congratulations for his fellowship.
I look forward to reading the book that will result.
I have not written directly to thank him because I have been
working non-stop on my new book, which is now almost, thank
the good Lord, finished.
     I need one bit of help from you and the resources of
the music division. I want to print the well-known
song Shoo Fly Don't Bother Me in my new anthology, in the
way I remember my mother singing it to me --- i.e., as a Civil
War soldiers' songs, but I can't remember
any more of the first verse and chorus, viz...
     I feel I Feel I feel like a morning star, (2)
          Shoo, fly,, don't bother me, (3)
          For I belong to Company D.
And I am in hopes you could find for me more of the Civil War
stanzas of the piece. Botkin has a number of references to
the song in his American Play Party Songs, but none of those
books are available in London, and so I am in a difficulty position
in the matter. I would also like to see the text of the 
music hall version which was published, I believe, about the
time of the Civil War.
     I hope all this will not be too much trouble to you. If it
should cost you any time out of strictly office hours to attend
