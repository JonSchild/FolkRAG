Gentlemen: 

About a month ago I addressed a letter
(of which I enclose a copy) ordering certain
records. I have never had any reply to this
letter. Are the records now being made, and
may I expect them soon?

With this I am sending you a copy of
a Chapter about records in my Guide to the
           Mary Nellish Archibold Memorial Library
           Sackville
           New Brunswick, Canada

May I hope to hear from you soon? If there is
a question of payment in advance please let me
know how much I should send you.

Very sincerely yours,
*signed* R.C. Archibold
