BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC 

(Page 166 - Old Favorite Songs) 

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored 
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword.
His truth is marching on. 

Chorus:              Glory, glory, Hallelujah! 
                            Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
                            Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
                         His truth is marching on!

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat,
He is shifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat.
Oh, be swift my soul to answer Him, be jubilant my feet!
Our God is marching on.

Chorus:              Glory, glory, Hallelujah! 
                            Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
                            Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
                         His truth is marching on!

From age to age they gather, all the brave of heart and strong;
In the strife of truth with error, of the right against the wrong; 
I can see their gleaming banner, I can hear their triumph song; 
The truth is marching on. 

Chorus:              Glory, glory, Hallelujah! 
                            Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
                            Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
                         His truth is marching on!
