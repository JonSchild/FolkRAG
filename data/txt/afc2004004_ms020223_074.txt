TL: Where did you get your paper and pencils?
BJ: Why, the teacher would bring 'em there. An', however, I guess
they got 'em [, you know,] from the city, ya know. 'Cause all the
teachers we had come from the city.
TL: Did you have to buy them from the teacher?
BJ: Ah, yes, they [have] had to buy everything. They give 'em so much
for the pencils, you know, an' the crayons. Everything was paid for.
It's jest a little bit, but it was paid for.
TL: From the community.
BJ: Tha's right.
TL: From the people.
BJ: Tha's right. From the people. The people had to pay...
And we had...
TL: Did everybody pay something, regardless of whether they had
children or not?
BJ: Oh, well, they did if, if they wanted to he'p someone with
their chillum.
TL: I see.
BJ: You see?
TL: Otherwise they only paid for their own.
BJ: Tha's all, um-hum. But plen'y a folks helped other folks
with their chillum. Jus' like if you had a, a sister or, or 
somebody had a big family, you didn't have none, you he'ps 'em,
if you want to, you know, see? 'Cause they, they needed help,
ya know. Everybody, [needed help] you know? An' sometime people sell things
to git a chance to pay for their children's books. You know, an'
make things an' sell so as to git a chance to pay for the chilren's
books. So that's what they did. An' other folks would
help people that didn't have any children.
