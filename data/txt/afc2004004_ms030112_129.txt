MRS. DAVIS:
Thats true.
SHUNNA:
Thats an interesting theory, because his whole philosopy was based on that, get out of it, what you put into it.
MRS. DAVIS:
 Yeah, thats true.
LARRY:
You know we speak about, you know how you feel like he's just gone away, he'll be back. I think back all the things I heard him say and I can think back how he used to call you sweetheart. You could hear that SWEETHEART.
MRS. DAVIS:
When he wanted something you know. Sometimes he'd call I'd be so close I'd say Look I'm right here Chile.
LARRY:
And he'd say GIVE ME A DRINK OF WATER.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes he would
LARRY:
That was, I always like that. He was really fun to be around you know. I didn't come around here as much as I should have in the last couple years but I was just like before when I went away and used to stay those months I'm doing the same thing now I'm sitting up trying to better my everything you know. And its really hard to get me out of the house you know I don't want to come out and don't want nobody in. I'll stay in. Thats the way its going to stay.
