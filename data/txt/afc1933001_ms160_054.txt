CREED
OF THE AMERICAN YOUTH CONGRESS

We dedicate ourselves to the service of our country and mankind.

We will uphold the American ideal, which is the democratic way of
life. We will help assure its bounty to all races, creeds and colors.

We will maintain our country, founded by men and women who sought a
land where they could worship God in their own way, as a haven of a free
conscience and the free religious spirit.

We will safeguard the heritage of industrial development, technical
skill, natural resource and culture which has made our country the inspiration
for the youth of all lands, and we will use whatever talents we have to
add to that heritage. 

We will be social pioneers helping to forge new tools for an era in
which education, the chance to make a decent living, the opportunity for
health, recreation and culture will assure the fullest development to all.

We will respect and defend the Constitution, keystone of American liberties,
which includes the Bill of Rights granting freedom of religion and
press, of speech and assemblage. We will seek progress only within the framework
of the American system of government which is founded on the principle
that all political power is vested in the people, and we will oppose all undemocratic 
tendencies and all forms of dictatorship.

We will help make the United States a force for people and pledge that
our patriotism will not be at the expense of other peoples and nations, but
one that will contribute to the brotherhood of man.

We will not permit race prejudice, religious intolerance, or class 
hatred to divide us from other young people. We will work for the unity
of our generation and place that united strength at the service of our
country, which we will defend against all enemies.

We pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and
to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible with liberty
and justice for all.
