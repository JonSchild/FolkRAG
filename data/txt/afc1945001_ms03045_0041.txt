OHIO REPORT
Due August 17, 1942

"The Government recently made the 
statement that none of the U.S. 
transports had been sunk, either 
in the last World War or the 
present one. The rumor is going 
the rounds, however, that several 
bodies, clothed in U.S. uniforms 
were found floating around Newfoundland. 
This even was printed 
in The Ohio State Journal." 
Upon checking all of the issues 
of the newspaper for the past 
two weeks, I can find no mention 
of such a happening in this 
paper. The rumor was relayed 
to me by an insurance salesman 
who said that he had heard it 
from one of the workers at a 
motor freight concern.
