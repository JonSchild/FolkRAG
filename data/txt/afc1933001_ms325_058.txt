Oldtime Stories Show 'Dumb as Ox'
Saying Reflects on Man's Judgment

By J. FRANK DOUBIE

   Riding through the Clemmons
state prison farm in Brazoria county
and seeing 16 oxen drawing two
wagons loaded with wood, brought
back to me the days when ox-drawn
settlers coming up the Brazos
river could at the evening camp
sometimes look back and see the
spot they had left that morning. A 
man on horseback might bring a
chunk of fire from the old camp to 
make a fire at the new one.
   The old saying "as dumb as an 
ox" reflects about as much credit 
on popular judgment as calling a
man "as mean as a dog" - as if the
dog were the meanest thing in the 
world. About the smartest ox that
ever lived, according to the stories
that have come down, was a muley
Texas steer named Old Brindle. He
belonged to a freight outfit that
made a practice of traveling empty
to a railroad point and returning 
with heavy loads.
   One evening before starting out 
empty for a consignment of freight, 
the overseer gave the night-herder
orders to bring in the oxen before
daylight next morning. By the time 
they arrived, pallets were rolled up
and in the wagons, breakfast was
ready, and as soon as it was bolted
each bull whacker began to inspan
his oxen.

Old Brindle Missing
   But the nigh wheeler, Old Brindle,
in Joe Goodbread's team was missing.
   This was strange, for Joe had just
seen him; the night-herder swore he
had pounded him on the rump several
times while bringing him in,
and the overseer remembered that
he had noticed him walk over close 
to his proper wagon when the oxen
came in. Each wagon had a trailer,
and all the wagons, including the
trailers, were covered with wagon
sheets, the white background causing
any animal near it to show up 
plain. Being a muley, Brindle was 
always conspicuous.
   Now, the whole outfit was delayed
on account of the missing ox.
With the first light the overseer
and the night-herder were scouring
the country around on horseback.
It was "so bare and level that a
jack rabbit needed to carry a {{??}}
for a shade," but Brindle was nowhere
in sight.
   Finally the overseer told Joe 
Goodbread to {{??}} Brindle's mate behind 
the trailer, for leader, to yoke
up another pair of oxen for wheelers,
and to pull out.

Went Eight Miles
   The wagon train went about
eight miles and stopped for a late
dinner. While the men were eating,
they continued to speculate on
the strange vanishment of Old Brindle.
Joe Goodbread remarked that

colt. He tried to pull the whole
load by himself."
   Heel flies could galvanize the 
most lethargic beasts of the yoke
into action. Before the Civil war
Texas steers by the thousands were
driven to Missouri to be sold for
oxen. Robert M. Wright in his history
of Dodge City, "Cowboy Capital," 
gives the best account I know
of concerning spontaneous action
among oxen.

Crossing Plains
   In the fall of 1862 he was going
east across the plains of western
Kansas with a great freight outfit.
It was his job to drive, afoot, the
loose oxen along behind the wagons,
which were strung out for several 
miles. It was a hot day, and young
Wright became tired of carrying his 
coat.
   One of the loose oxen was a great 
longhorned  steer named Dan, so 
gentle that at stream crossing any 
footman in reach of Dan would 
jump upon his back and ride across.
Dan always lagged behind, the draggiest
of the drag animals. This 
warm day he was particularly 
draggy.
   Wright decided to load his coat on
Old Dan. Turning the sleeves
wrongside out, he hooked them
somehow over the horns, letting the
body of the coat flap down over the
steer's face. The lining of the coat
was red and yellow.
   Dan "trudged along unconscious
of the appearance he presented. I 
hurried him up," to quote from
Wright's account, "by repeated
punches from my carajo pole, for 
in dressing him up we had gotten
behind. He was a ludicrous sight,
and no sooner did he make his appearance
among the other cattle
than a young steer bawled out in
the steer language, "Great Scott!
What monstrosity is this coming 
among us to destroy us?' and with 
one long, loud, beseeching bellow,
put all the distance possible between 
himself and the terror behind 
him. All his brothers followed
the example, each one seeing
how much louder he could bawl
than his neighbor and each one
trying to outrun the rest."
   They soon overtook the rear wagons,
and the yoked oxen joined in 
the panic. The docile Dan alone remained
with the owner of the coat,

who quickly removed {{?}} from the
horns. Hours later the man and 
the ox caught up with the train.
Still riding like mad, the boss
paused to ask, "What on earth
caused the stampede back yonder?"
   Wright couldn't imagine what,
"unless it was a wolf running across
the road."
   "I know it was the cussed wolves
the boss agreed. I saw several this
afternoon. That wolf didn't do
thing but wreck six or eight wagons
on Walnut creek, and fro-{{?}}
there on for the next five miles
or 12 more. Most of th-
broken up they'll never
states again. Three steers have
their legs broken and the front
cattle are 15 miles from here. There's
a broken arm and a  broken leg 
among the divers. Damn and
double damn these cussed wolves.:
   Bob Wright noticed Old Dan looking
at him while this conversation
was going on and give "a sly wink."

Breaking An Ox
   Breaking an ox to ride must have
been a good deal of fun. "I was
working for the Quien Sabe outfit
on the Pecos," Horace Wilson used
to relate, "While {{??}} was
boss. One {{?}} we made a dry
camp about 10 miles from where 
we were to hold the roundup next
day. Next morning Tillus woke up
to find that a coyote had chewed
his stake rope in two and that he
was afoot.
   "Boys,' Tillus said while we were
saddling up, just rope me a big
steer and bring him close to
saddle. Then after I'm on h{{??}}
throw him into the drive and 
ride to camps.'
   "It didn't take long for a couple
of us to find and stretch out a big
old moss-horned steer. Tillus saddled
him and, just as we let him
up, went aboard. The way he
bawled and bellered would have
made a grey mule laugh. We headed
him in the right direction, and
every once in a while that morning
I got a glimpse of Tillus a quarter
of a mile or so ahead, riding off
some pinnacle in a run, whooping 
and hollering and whipping the old
ox with his hat. At the roundup
ground, within two hundred yards 
of the chuck wagon, Tillus loosed
his cinch and fell off, saddle and
all."
