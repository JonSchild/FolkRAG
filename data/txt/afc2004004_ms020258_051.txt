HARD TIMES

chorus:         in ol' Virginia
            Hard times in ol' Virginia
                     in ol' Virginia
            Hard times in ol' Virginia.

1)  My missus a rich ol' lady
Hard times in ol' Virginia
Seven servants around her table
Hard times in ol' Virginia (chorus)

2)  If I can make it I'm goin' tomorrow
Hard times in ol' Virginia
Turn the wheel, go draw some water
Hard times in ol' Virginia.  (chorus)

3)  My ol' mistress a rich ol' lady
Hard times in ol' Virginia
Seven servants around her table
Hard times in ol' Virginia
Seven more for to roll the baby 'round her
Hard times in ol' Virginia.
In ol' Virginia
Hard times in ol' Virginia  (2)

5)  Pull your corn and lay by the fire
Hard times in ol' Virginia.  (2)  (chorus)
