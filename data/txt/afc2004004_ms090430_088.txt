AN URBAN-RURAL AREA OF MIXED FARMING

Davidson County, Tennessee

Davidson County is almost in the center of Tennessee, encircled
by the highlands which stretch from the Cumberland tablelands to the Tennessee
river. The population of the county is a little over 222,900, with
a rural population numbering 68,988, of which less than 15 per cent are

Other communities like Brentwood, Goodletsville and Nolensville are located
ten to fifteen miles from Nashville.
