Dear Mr. Rowse:

In response to your letter to Mr. Elam, who had
charge of shipping the records in the absence of both
Mr. John A. Lomax and myself, - I see no reason that
you shouldn't keep the whole group of Archive recordings
until after Christmas. I feel sure that, in your hands,
they will receive the very best of care.

One of the disappointments of my summer in Michigan
was that I failed to hear Mr. Cooke's programs on American
folksongs and, in order that this will not happen
again, I would appreciate your sending me the notices of
future programs. I presume that these programs are
broadcast by short wave or is that the case?

Through some oversight, we have not received the
recordings of the broadcasts of last summer and I take
this opportunity to remind you of the promise that Mr.
Cooke made the Library last summer in this regard.

Sincerely yours,


Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
