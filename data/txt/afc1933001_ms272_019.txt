STRANGE THING HAPPEN ALL OVER THE LAND

Strange thing happen all over the land.
Strange thing happen all over the land.
Make no different what the people all say
Christ told us we had to watch and pray.

Go and read you will see how Joshua won
Go and read you will see how Joshua won
He prayed to the Lord. The Lord stop the sun
Till Joshua war battle won

Ought mind working for Uncle Sam.
You sure can help the war that way
Tennessee and Mississippi Georgia and Arkansas
All ought to pray to win the war.

Uncle Sam is putting outs war bonds and government stamp
Government say he going to keep the war                   straight
Uncle Sam is the ruler of all these state

Stand and rang your hand
Stand and rang your hand
Stand and rang your hand
The strange thing happen all over the land

Read the bible you will see what it say
He said it would be wars and              wars
Christ told us we had to watch and pray

Christ told us we had to watch and pray.
Christ told us we had to watch and pray
Government told the people all go and                  the street
to hear the President speak
Christ told us we had to watch and pray
Christ told us we had to watch and pray
