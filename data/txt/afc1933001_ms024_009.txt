[S]7) Several minor disasters considerably retarded the work.
The wheels of the car were stole along with the personal 
belongings o myself and my son.  While collecting "Cajun" 
songs in Southwestern Louisiana, the car overturned,was 
badly smashed, the recording machine was damaged, clothing 
destroyed by battery acid.  My son, Alan, my co-laborer, 
about this same time fell ill and was not able to rejoin me 
until December first, four months afterwards.  But the greatest 
source of delay for us was the frequently recurring 
breakdown of our recording instrument, furnished us by the 
Library of Congress.
During 1933 I had engaged to make folk-song lectures in 
nine states.  These lectures came in a group and required 
about three weeks of my time.  The tour resulted in the formation 
of a vigorous State Folk-Lore Society in Tennessee 
and in the cooperative help of several individual collectors.  
My vacation extended from July 21 until September 1.  
Alan took no vacation unless  his extended illness could be 
so-called.

8) I call your attention particularly to two matters that 
should receive your immediate attention:
1) Provision for the proper transcription,translation 
and annotation of the records we are placing in the 
Library of Congress.
b) Likewise the preparation of a list of commercially 
recorded fork-songs, securing and filing these records for 
the Library of Congress.
