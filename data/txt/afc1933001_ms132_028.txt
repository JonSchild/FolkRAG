Dear Mrs. Bryant:
Our visit with you was the high point of our trip to Indiana and you may be sure that the old songs you recalled for us will be kept in a place of honor in the Archive. It is rare to find one person who remembers as many as you do. I feel sure, too, that you have not half exhausted your store of material and that you will be able to recall many more fine pieces with very littler trouble. We must keep up a correspondence and you must keep busy jotting down the songs so that we'll have a good excuse to come by to see you and your bevy of beautiful daughters again.
Elizabeth and I want to take this occasion to thank you for your hospitality and I want to assure you of both the Archive's and the Library's appreciation of your kindness in our behalf
With very best regards to you and all the other Bryants, big and littler, I am
Very sincerely yours,
AL:ed
