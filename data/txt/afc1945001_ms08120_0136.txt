A Joke:

Air Raid Warden: "For incendiary bombs you
should have two buckets of sand and a long-
handled shovel."

Citizen:  "But what if it happens to
be a high-explosive bomb?"
Warden:"You won't need the sand
then."

"Nice little wedding wasn't it?"
Yes, and do you know the bride's
father gave them a pound of butter to
start out with.

George.
