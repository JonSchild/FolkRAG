Lomax:  When did that happen, Jeannie ? Do you know  ?

Jean: It must hav been a long, long time ago.  May be a couple of hundred years ago.  It's an old song.  But that was a version that was amongst our people.  I did hear it among the old, old people.  A lot of them sung it, and nauturally, we got it.

Lomax:  Was it always sung solo - or all together ?

Jean:  IF you people were going to sing xxxxxxx -  they usually sang one at a time.  Nobody joined in the choruses.

Lomax: Or any accompaniment at all ?  Fiddle  ?

Jeannie: No.

Lomax:  Jeann, do you know any disillusioned or sad love sngs like "they'll hug you and kiss you and leave you..."  ...ladies falling in love with false-hearted young men ?

Jeann:  I've something in my head....

1) When I was noo but sweet sixteen and beauty just in blooming-o,
O little, little did I think at nineteen I'd be greeting-o.
For the ploughman lads the gay wee lads, they're false and deceivin'
-o<
They'll sail awa' and gang awa ' and they'll leave their lassie greeting-o.

2) For if I had a-ta'en my mother's advice,
And ta'en my mother's bidding-o,
I wadna be sitting at your fireside,
Crying, hishy=by my bairnie-o.
O hish-ye-ba, oh I'm your ma,
But the Lord knows whaur's your daddy-o,
For if I had taen my mother's advice......
