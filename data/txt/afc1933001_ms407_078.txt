THE BUFFALO SKINNERS
One day out in Abilene, Texas, I met an old-time buffalo hunter
and asked him to tell me some of his adventures. Back in the days
just after the Civil War, these hunters used to go out on the plains

nearest railroad and from there shipped East where the skin side was

hide. Years later a fine dressed buffalo hid sold for one hundred
dollars, buffalo overcoats up to $250.00

were also often cut and fashioned into cloaks for fair ladies and into
overcoats for men. The Indians likewise wore them thrown over their
shoulders, and one also sometimes found them used as floor covering
in their teepees. Needless to say, they were warm.

carried a needle gun and killed the buffalo for the entire hunting
party. The Indians said of another buffalo gun, the sharps rifle,
"It shoots today and kills tomorrow." While some of the gang skinned
