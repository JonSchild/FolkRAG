September 24, 1938

Dear Alan:
     You are hearing from me instead of from Dr. Spivacke this
morning for the Chief is out of town, in fact he's having 
exciting experiences in the New England flood section. This enclosed
check is for a larger amount than you requested, but 
don't be overly jubilant. You will notice carefully, I hope,
the little financial statement prepared and attached by Mr. 
Rabbitt. Then, guard your expenditures accordingly. It would
be extremely difficulty to obtain any more money for this trip.
     We have been terribly rushed in the Music Division the last
few days and Mrs. Hasselbush, who keeps the leave record, is
away. My count may be a little off, but I figure that you have 
22 1/2 days of annual leave left.
      An order for records has gone out but they have not arrived
yet. Tell us where you want some sand and we'll do it as fast as we can.
     Best of luck!

                                       In haste, but sincerely,,





Mr. Alan Lomax
