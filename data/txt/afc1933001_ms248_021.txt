Dear Father:

I have sent a letter for Luther Evans' signature about
the tire matter, which is enclosed, and have written a memo
about the trip you plan to take in west Texas.  I hope the
memo will be approved this week.  I think that your project to
document western stuff in west Texas is most important, and
I am sure that everyone here will agree with me there.  By
all means record Harry Stevens' experiences and songs.

I think I will request $500 flat for the trip, and I
imagine that will take care of the whole things, since
your present expenses account to about $250 of the $300 originally
set aside for your present accomplishment.

The more practicing you do at home before you start, to
get perfect cuts, the better, because I think Jerry feels that
most of your trouble comes not from mechanical defects so much
as from sheer failure to hit upon the simple solutions for
ordinary recording problems.  I enjoyed the enclosures you
sent from Johnny and Alice and Frank Goodwyn.  The reviews
were fine, but they none of them come up to the review in
Modern Music by Marc Blitzstein.  It's by far the best review
that's ever been given any of our books.  By all means, get a
copy.

Much love to Deanie.

Yours,
