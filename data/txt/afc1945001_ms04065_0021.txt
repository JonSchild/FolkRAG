Roosevelt doesn't have anyone of any intelligence
telling him what to do. This
administration is overloaded with crackpots.
Imagine Lincoln and Washington being advised
by men like Harry Hopkins. They've got
too many Jews down there.....Henderson's
real name is Horowitz....and Morgantheau...
and a bunch of other ones.
