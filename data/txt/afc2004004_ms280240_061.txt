(14)
And fair her feet did slide
And here she lay contented on Ciarnie's bonny side.
But when her father heard of this swore it was none done.
Says "You beguiled my daughter, my sorrows has begun."
For it's nine long months has passed and gone, she brought to nu a son
And I was quickly sent for to see what could be done.
They said that I would marry her, but that wouldna de,
Saying "Your a not a match for her, nor her nae match for thee."
But if she gets another match her father he can tell
That sedder got the maidenhead of Boggys Bonny Bell.
But now she's married a tin-smith and lives in Huntley toon
Makes naptha lamps and ladles aye, till a' the country roond.
For the powers above protect this girl, and keep her right and fine,
And keep her all from danger, who has this heart of mine.
And keep her aye, contented and always free from pride
And I'll return to Boggies lands on the crooked burnie sign.
