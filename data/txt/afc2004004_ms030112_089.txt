LARRY:
He said Well you come and see me sometime, and I say all right, and a little while went on, I started coming around and that went on for years. Well anyway one particular day Mrs. Davis, remember I come up there and I was drinking my wine Mrs. Davis was in another room and me Brother Davis was sitting in this room, he was playing something on the guitar that was sounding so good I had to take a quick drink you know. I took me a quick drink and then I heard Mrs. Davis coming from the room so I didn't want her to see it, so I went to my pocket and put it right into my pocket missed my pocket and it went on your rug.
MRS. DAVIS:
I saying Larry you knows better than that.
LARRY:
And I just looked at her, I says Oh I'm caught now and Gary say What, What you drinking in here. So I had to leave it was too hard for me I had to get out, I new I was wrong so I left and I waited a long time a couple of months before I got enough courage to go back.
MRS. DAVIS:
Thats right.
LARRY:
Finally I'm getting cold on the phone, I apologized to Gary and Mrs. Davis, but all that was leading up to I never brought another drink around in that house, even now, I never did. That was meaning to me to stop drinking and Brother Davis started talking to me out of it, talking me out of it.
