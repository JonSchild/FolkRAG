Joke

Mrs. Brown was talking to Mrs.
Jones, her neighbor. Mrs. Brown was
saying "This shoe rationing didn't
catch me asleep. Mrs. Jones said "Why,
Mrs. Brown, I'm surprised. Why you
shouldn't hoard shoes. "Be like me,
and just buy them for the joy
of buying them, I brought four pairs
of play shoes last Saturday." said
Mrs. Jones.
