                                     Sea Island Singers

Cut off by swamp and sea from the mainland of Georgia St
Simon's Island was, until recent years, a haven for independent
black communities with a language and life of their own. Here
spirituals can be heard as they were sung perhaps a century or 
more ago. 

This film is a record of a performance of some of the traditional
religious activities and music of Southern blacks as performed by
the Georgia Sea Island Singers. Included are a spiritual, "Moses"
two "shouts" (religious dances with singing). "Adam in the Garden
Picking Up Leaves," and "Down in the Mire" and one solo dance. 
"The Buzzard Lope," which comes from Africa "While buzzards
wait and watch, a single bird of prey circles a dead slave"
