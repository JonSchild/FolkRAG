(Stan) You have to get it (unint.). You have to be very careful with
it (unint.)

AL: Why do they put harps(?) in them always?

Stan: Well that's on the pattern(?) you know, and a lot of them builds
parts(?) this way, but I build(?) them goin' forward. None of us ever
goes backwards, we go forwards. I go forwards, a lot of people go
backwards, I don't. I look on ahead, I don't back up. So this goes on
like that, that's the fingerboard. And this is a piece of a (unint.
and this is cut off down thru there...

AL: We've been working on this thing all day.

Stan: Yeah. And this here, that's what goes on this, but this here has
come off,....I'll run it back a little bit more and show you how it
would go...This stepped on this like this. And then, this has to be
hollowed out, and that's how you work 'em, you know. I'll show you...

AL: How many dulcimers have you made?

Stan: Well, I kept a count a while, and it just got too much on my mind
to do you know, so I just had to quit. I had 300 and some about four
years ago, five I'd say, and I just quit. I guess I've made, banjos
and dulcimers, I'd estimate about 1000, since I started workin' in 'em.
I'll lay this stuff out of the way. I'll play a tune on this one here,
an old dulcimer right there. I'll lay it down on that table there....
Now this is one that my daddy made in 1931. He sawed these pieces out
to get 'em thin enough. He didn't have no plane, didn t have nothin'.
You can see the saw, if you look you can see the hand saw prints on
it, if you look close. These hooks here, that you're lookin' at,
they're bent...put 'em in hot water and bend 'em. And I'll turn it
on around and show you how you couldn't get no fret wires back that
