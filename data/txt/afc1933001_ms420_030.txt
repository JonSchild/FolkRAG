C.W.A. Blues,
   Walter Roland, Melotone 13103-A(15479)

My woman told me to get up this mornin',
"Go get yo'se'f a job.
I want you to try to take care of me,
While the times is hard,"
[Chorus:]
Cho: I hollered, "Hey, woman,
Lawd God, is you goin' my way?
Lawd, I b'lieve I'll go get me a job,
Workin' for that C.W.A"

She told me that some folks was goin' round here talkin',
'Bout they got jobs for sale,
If you want a good job,
You just go to that old county[y] jail,
Cho: And holler "Hey, man,
Great god let me go yo' way,
I just want a job workin'
for that C.W.A."

You know that C.W.A., they payin' you
Nine sixty a week,
You don't have to worry about that world' fair
Cho: [And] Somethin' to eat,
[3rd Chorus.]  I hollered "Hey, woman,
Lawd god is you goin' my way
Cause I got a job workin',
[*For ____________,*]

You know I told my woman this mornin',
Just about half past three,
Wake up early
And come go with me, Cho
[3rd Chorus]

You know I'm gonna take my womanx down,
To that world's fair sto'
I'm gonna carry her this time
And I won't have to carry her no mo'. Cho.
[Chorus.]
