Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter is a glad surprise, but why are you
going to Bucknell? The Festival is at Beaver this year, 
you know, just outside of Philadelphia. I hope that was
a spelling error.

As for Gran--if necessary she'll sing sola, but
perhaps it won't be necessary. You see, I expect to be
with her over the week-end, and, again, I'm free to leave
Philadelphia around two in the afternoon on Monday.

If you are going to Bucknell, and not to the Festival, 
will you let me know where I can telephone you at
Bryn Mawr on Sunday to make definite arrangements? That,
at the moment, seems the best idea I have.

Again--three cheers for you impending arrival!

Kay Dealy 

P.S. I have no school on Tuesday--but I fear that would
detain you unnecessarily. I just telephoned Gran's
home in Gloucester, and her granddaughter, Miss Eaves,
(my chum) will be home on Monday so that solves everything,
I think.

Until I hear from you---

Adios.
