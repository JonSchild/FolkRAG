Reel 3-

1. She wouldn't say quit - This is another of
those songs where a few verses is sufficient

2. Let us Get Together - a really excellent song -
should be used (as with death don't have no mercy,
keep yours Lamps Trimmed + Burning. This song
was recorded by hot Tuna).

3. Sun is going down - I don't like the way the banjo comes
in - it is awkward & too overpowering

4. You cry because of me- This is in E minor same as The
Angels message to me, Keep your Lamps
Trimmed & Burning & Death Don't Have No
Mercy, all of which are more exciting &
interesting pieces, though this is
pleasant - but not great

5. You going to quit me baby - This isn't great - if its used - I'd only
use a few verses - sounds like a slowed
down version of Hesitation

6. Don't Let Me Catch you here - pleasant piece, but his
guitar work doesn't compare to
anything on the guitar & banjo album -
I wouldn't use this

[7. Nice Pleasant Pie.]
7. Come Down + See my sometime - This is a neat song - I don't
think it's on any records - very good tune -
Nice feeling with people singing along
 
8. Babylon's Falling - This is a nice song - pretty good.
