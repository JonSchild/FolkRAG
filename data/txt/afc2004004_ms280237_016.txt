Harry Cox, Lomax flat London, [Dece] November 27, I953. 

Cox: . . .what I can't understand in these olden times, people never 
. . .I? I, I know that - that used to be sung, er, The Servant Maid 
- my grandfather, an' that's over two hundred years ago. An' they 
had no learnin'. My father couldn't write his own [nma?] name - he 
could write his own name, an' that's all he could do. Just put 
Roberts [large empty space] An' he went a-fishin', seventeen 
old skipper, you know. An' 
he couldn't write, yet read. All he used to do when they sent 
their [large empty space] off, cut a tally on a bit o' wood, you know, what 
they call a tally - just the first letters o' the name, an' tie 
it on 'em. An' now. . .An' yet they made these songs up 
an' different tunes they git now.

Cox: . . .this part of the world. Say, "Would you mind taking it up 
to the door," you see, an' he took this [large empty space] up to this 
fellow's door, an' knock at the door, an' she was goin', she 
wanted to get rid of it. Well, he looked over his shoulder, an' 
this kid was goin', there was this bloke there, he stood there [wiht] 
with the [bak] basket in this fellow's door. That were come in like 
that. 

Lomax: What does the rhyme say, Harry? 

Cox: What, the chorus part? 

Lomax: Yes. 

Cox: All you that want wit go to London. 

Some cried old hartichokes, 
Some cried old clo'es; 
Some with a snuff box 
Just fit fer yer nose. 
If you' heard them you'd thought they were callin' the cows, 
They made such havoc in London. 

London is/ sharp as the edge of a knife, [*sings - as*] 
The city is filled with fraction and strife. 
There's none so sweet as a country life; [*sings - counterey*] 
All you that want wit, go to London. 

Lomax: That's a beauty. (Cox laughs) 

Kennedy: I never heard that before. 

Cox: Well, that is how they'd go [large empty space] like this here:
