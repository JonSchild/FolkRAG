PATTONIO, THE PRIDE OF THE PLAIN*
I'll tell you a story that will thrill you, I know,
Of a horse that I once owned in New Mexico.
You will gaze at his picture with wondering eyes
And look at the arrow that springs from his side.
He was swift as an antelope and black as a crow
With a star on his forehead as white as the snow.
His arched neck was hidden by his swift-flowing mane,
And I called him Pattonio, the pride of the plain. 
His hair, like a lady's was glossy and fine, 
He was restless and proud, but he was a gentle and kind. 
The country was new and the settlers was skeerce,
And the Indians on the warpath was savage and fierce.
Sixteen brave rangers were sent out from the post,
They never returned, and we knew they were lost.
Those scouts were sent out every day from the post,
They never came back, and we knew they were lost. 
So the captain, he spoke, says, "Some one must go
Down on the dark borders of old Mexico."
Sixteen brave rangers, they answered, "Right here!"
But the captain, he saw me, I was standing quite near. 
Pattonio stood by me, his nose in my hand,
Said the captain, "Your horse is the best in the land. 
"You're good for the riding, you're the lightest man here,
On the back of that mustang you have nothing to fear."
Then, proud of my pony, I answered, "You know
Pattonio and I are both willing to go."
"For speed and endurance, I'll trust in the black."
*From the singing of the Gant family, Austin, Texas, and of Eddie Murphy, Crowley,
Louisiana.
They all shook my hands, and I mounted his back,
Rode down the black pathway, turned his head to the right;
The black struck a trot, and he kept it all night.
