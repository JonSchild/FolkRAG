When he was robbed 
His mother's death 
Death dream
Man like him can consolate anybody
His fav. Bible verse- let not your heart 
be troubled.
XI They killed him for kissin a white woman
Disc of race prejudice
New York -- you ain't  gon be free nowhere. 
Colored person has no power
Only so much I'm allowed to say
The guns he has carried
Guitar snatching in N. Car
Never fight over women
People get tired of livin
Trusts his wife -- where he keeps money
Robbery in N. Y. 
XII Prejudice
They kill em in the South whenever
They get ready
Keep your mouth shut
[*Very 
fine*] God willed these things
The prophets, too, were lynched
 But the bottom rail will come to the top
 Every body one color
  " [every body] equal share
  Hell on earth - wicked punished
  Prayer will take care of everything - hides
  & carries deep thoughts
