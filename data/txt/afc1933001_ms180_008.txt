Dear Dave:

I am sorry I didn't get to see you the other afternoon but I thought
perhaps the meeting might last late so I went home.

Your remark about Columbia's new policy in regard to playing records
late in the evening is the reason for this letter.

As I have told you at various times, we have been working here for the
past few months on the development of a new type of radio program constructed
entirely from field recordings with connecting narration. We
have developed two series of this kind. The first is called, "The Ballad
Hunter". This is a series of ten fifteen-minute programs with John A.
Lomax as narrator (and he has a very remarkable radio personality I think
you will feel) with dubbed selections from the field recordings of folk
songs he has made for the Archive. The second series, which we have just
recently completed, is called, "This is History" and covers the period
from May, 1941, to November, 1941. The actors on the program are the
people of various localities discussing their problems, telling stories,
singing songs, etc., and the intent of each programs is to tell the story
of some community or some community activity in the words of the people
of that community. By and large, they are quite successful and technically,
I believe, acceptable for broadcast. Both these series have
gone out in small numbers to local stations, the first last summer,
the second currently. It seems to me that they both might fit very 
nicely into your schedule of late programs and I would like you to
audition them and see what you think. Whether or not you decide to 
use them, I know that you, yourself, will have a lot of fun with the
stuff because it's all out of the horse's mouth and pretty damned
honest. The final series, particularly, he has a very permanent quality
and lives up to its title, "This is History". It will be just as interesting
to broadcast in 1950 as it is now, I believe, and this cannot
be said for all radio shows.

Do you think there is any possibility that Columbia might like to use
me in a fifteen-minute spot of my own sustaining any time during the
