Dear Alan:

You are right. I cannot
bring myself to continue writing
letters to anyone who fails to reply -
the one exception, for the present,
being Bess Brown until she
gets out "on her own" she can
keep on imposing on my
generosity and forbearance and
I'll keep on taking it. So does
custom, a sense of duty, a natural
inclination - call it what
you will - influence me, pretty much as
such motives influence all
men.
