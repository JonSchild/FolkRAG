As a need transition from the spirituals to the blues I would like to call your attention to an excerpt from a record.  This is an old camp meeting spiritual called "Dark was the night and cold was the ground".

But in the Negro folk-blues the gaiety is the same.  The word blues is coming into the language as the synonym for melancholy.  To some the blues may mean a stanza form of two lines, the first line repeated in the second with some slight variation in the text of the music and the third clinching line - the rhyming line - a stanza then of three lines, the first two repeated.
