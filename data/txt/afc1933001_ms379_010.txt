     When I gone back an' dat door been lock I stay away from dat window. I too 'fraid somebody gwine see my face behind dose jail house bars. An' too much sleep ain't come to me neither. I toss an' I toss. An' when I does go to sleep it ain't no time til de fowl crow.
     After breakfast de sheriff send up a dep'ty an' he take me to de 'liminary hearing.
     When I gone in de sheriff office, dere sit de lady type-writer before a big fire in de chimbly. I gone over an' squat with my face to de fire an' my back to de people. While I was a-thawin' out, I hear mens comin' an' gwine. I hear one man say,
     "Dere's de man."
     An' other man say, "Turn yo' face round."
     I turn.
     "Dat ain't no Sandy Dease. Dat's Mike Maybank."
     An' dere was my ole friend, de magister. I like Mister Higgins, an' he like me, so I tell him:
     "Mister Higgins, I was goin' to de big mill to hunt work.  An' I happen on four little duck. I fetch 'em to Mister Mercer but he ain't up yet. An' de cook don't know. So I try for to sell 'em when I meet up with a colored man an' he say, 
     "Take 'em to de house I point you to,
     "An' I done jest dat an' take 'em to de gentleman what fetch 'em here, to de jail house. I ain't mean no harm. I only try for to sell 'em so I could buy some victual an' maybe a little Christmas."
