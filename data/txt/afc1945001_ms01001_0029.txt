The director of Selective Service, denounces
the rumor as 'an outright lie from start to
finish.'  There never has been a dispute over
a religious incident, he says; no priest ever
has been involved in an altercation with a
draft board and no draft board has ever been
closed."

On the positive side it should be noted that the emphasis
was shifted from the scapegoats to the Catholic priests,
towards whom violence was supposed to have been directed.  It
answers the rumor in part by lining up a series to show the
manifest absurdity of each through the perspective of seeing the
others.  It cites as authority not simply the Selective Service
director, who could be expected to give no other answer, but also
in each case, those people who might be expected to confirm the
rumor had there been any kernel of truth in it.  These authorities
also would be the people whose word carries most weight among
those who might be inclined to accept the rumor.  On the negative
side, the counteraction waits too long before giving the clear cut
statement that the rumors are false.  It makes it possible for the 
reader to be interrupted before he has considered the entire answer.
Building up to a climax is good if the buildup is short.  Not only
should the flat denial have come toward the very beginning of the
FACT presentation, but with each of the illustrative rumors that 
were also answered it should have been clearer that each was a
phony.  The rumor makes too many points: 1. The draft board is 
all Jewish, 2. They are too lenient to other Jews.  3. Majority 
of inductees Christian (a corrolary of two, but stated as an
additional item.)  4. Situation became scandalous.  5. Catholic
