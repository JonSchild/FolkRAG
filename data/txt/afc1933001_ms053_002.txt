Dear Miss McDonald:

Your letter of September 6 was forwarded to me in New York City
and I have just found opportunity to reply. It should probably have
been addressed to Alan Lomax, Assistant in Charge, Archive of American
Folk-Song in the Library of Congress. I am referring it to him 
for further attention when he returns in a few weeks from a folk-song
collecting tour of Michigan.

I wish to suggest now that you examine carefully for occupational
or labor songs the following books:

Lomax, John A.
Cowboy songs and other frontier ballads.
New York, The Macmillan co., 1938
(Enlarged and with additional music, reprinted from the
original 1911 edition).

Lomax, John A., and Alan Lomax
American ballads and folk songs.
New York; The Macmillan co., 1934.

Lomax, John A., and Alan Lomax
Negro folk songs as sung by Lead Belly.
New York; The Macmillan co., 1936.

Sandburg, Carl
The American songbag.
New York; Harcourt, Brace & co., 1927.

Scattered through all these books, I think you will find some of
the songs that you have in mind. Such occupations, however, as "raising
the fruit", "the fishing industry", "manufacturing", etc., have produced
few, if any, examples of folk music. I have been told that in the cigar
manufacturing plants of Durham, N. C., the negroes sing songs about the
making of cigars, but I have never been able to procure the music.

It will be well, I think, for you to come here and hear typical
records played from the large collection that has been accumulated here
in the Library of Congress from actual field recordings. By such a
