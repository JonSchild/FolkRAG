giving, at the outset, three of the lists of vodun deities that were obtained,
since here only so simple a matter is involved as names of gods.
These lists, it must be remarked, were given by people living in the same
valley; were they to be compared with lists collected from other parts of
the island, even greater disparities would be evident, as will be apparent
if the collection of names of loa given by Dorsainvil is consulted.  Certain
deities, whose names recur below and are also to be found in Dorsainvil's
list and in Parsons' notes would be included in any enumeration of gods of
the cult, since their worship prevails throughout Haiti.  Such would be 
Legba, Damballa, Aida Wedo, Aizan, Ogun, Agwe, Bosu, Simbi, Baron Samedi,
Gede, and Erzilie.  Others, though not enjoying as widespread a following,
are undoubtedly worshipped over wide areas.  A not inconsiderable number,
however, either represent gods that have resulted from the process of deifying
the souls of those who, in a given locality, were renowned for their
spiritual power, or represent survivals of regional African deities that
have been preserved in certain large family groups.

Turning now to the lists themselves, the first of these, obtained
from a woman functionary of the cult, may be given.  A single asterisk
after a name indicates that its exact counterpart is found in the second
list presented here, while two asterisks show the precise name was included
in the third listing.
