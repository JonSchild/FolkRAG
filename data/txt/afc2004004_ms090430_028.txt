there was a heavy demand for cotton, and prices soared bringing a period of affluence to planter and tenant. Since that time period prices have declined reaching a figure less than the cost of producing it.
     In some cotton areas, where it has been found that corn is a profitable related crop, tenants may divide their acreage between cultivation of the two crops. In three Delta Counties the tenant may not secure land for corn production on shares. If he insists on growing corn for work animals which he might own he must pay a stipulated cash rental for the land used for this purpose. Corn has been the chief feed crop for livestock and fowls and tenants have few of either.

     In this area our studies indicate that 40 per cent of the Negro share tenants, when they had settled their accounts, either received no cash or "went in the hole." Of the others, 24.1 per cent earned over $100in cash, and 4.2 per cent earned over $300. In a sample area in the eastern part of the state, and outside the Delta, 60 per cent of the tenants had no cash balance. A typical account from one of the large, well-managed plantations that made a practice of careful accounting with tenants is as follows:
