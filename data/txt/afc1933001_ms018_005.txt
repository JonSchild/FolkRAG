Dear Lomax:

I was much interested in getting a letter on July 12 
from Mr. Strunk, of the Division of Music, Library of Congress, concerning 
the possibility of securing the cooperation of his division 
in the Modern Language Association's plan to encourage and systematize 
the collection of folk songs. He wrote a good letter and expressed 
himself as being glad to do anything that he could.

I was particularly pleased that you are now the 
Honorary Consultant and Curator. I was on the eve of writing to you 
when your letter of July 19 was received. I certainly appreciate 
your writing so promptly and so helpfully and am glad to know that 
you had some thing to do with the action of the Modern Language Association 
last December. As you so well point out, the two chief 
problems are those of coordinating existing efforts and of financing 
the whole endeavor.

I am corresponding with various agencies and organizations 
on the first of these points, that of cooperation, and am 
receiving most appreciate and promising replies.

On the Central Committee of the Modern Language 
Association, there are Phillips Barry, of Cambrige, Miss Martha 
Beckwith, of Vassar, and Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr., of Virginia. I am 
wondering if you have any suggestions for the representative of 
the mid-West. I believe it would be a fine thing for you to be on this 
Central Committee also in order to tie [tighten] in more closely with the 
Library of Congress and your existing work. If you will agree, I 
will put your name on the Committee at once. 

There is already a cooperating committee from the 
Southeaster Modern Language Association, which covers the ballad producing 
states of the South. I have also written to the American Folk-Lore 
Society and feel sure that they will appoint a cooperating committee. 

As the plans develop or any further steps are taken, 
I will keep you informed. The whole movement is, so far as the Modern
