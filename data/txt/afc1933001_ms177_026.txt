My dear Sir;

Your letter of December 11th last was Rec'd by me,
and I am overjoyed at hearing from you.  Yours
found me feeling just fine.  I also received the money
that you sent along with your letter and I am
indeed grateful to you for every thing that you
have done for me.  That has been so very much that
I don't know just what to thank you for first, so
I am hoping for every good blessing for you for
being so kind to me.  I know that I can never repay
you for everything.  But surely you'll accept my
poor and pitiful gesture in trying to help in my
way.  That is by doing your bidding.  I am trying to
get the boys Together and make some songs that
will be satisfactorily to you.
   Please give my best regards to Mr. Allen.
I hope to have the boys lined up real soon and
just as soon as I do I'll write you at once.
   I am very truly yours.

James Baker.
