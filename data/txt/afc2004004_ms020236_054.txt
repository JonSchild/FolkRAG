[*WEST GREEN  (DR. BELL, ETC)*]

BJ:        She didn't get shot. . .Oh, yeah. . .She didn't get shot.
I met her years after that.   We was talkin' about Wes' Green
like we talkin' now, an' she. . .
TL:        Did she get burnt at all?
BJ:        No, her clothes caught afire.   Jus' sot her clothes on fire.
TL:        Oh, she put it out, huh?
BJ:        Oh yeah. . .She said she run them out!   Ha, ha!. . .So anyway,
they tol' me not to --                        not to
Jus' turn 'im off an' keep him turned off in the right way
'till I get ready to go -- 'cause they knew I was goin' where
Mama was, ya know, [the lady] lated, anyhow, ya see?   An' so, the one
who knowed him, told me, not to tell him off in any bad way.
Jus' [tell] turn him off, ya know.    So I didn' say nothin'.  I
didn't get a chance to try that; didn' get a [canc] chance to talk
with 'im.   So one night it was just a rainin'; it was on a
Sattiday (Saturday) night.   It was rainin' an' I wasn't goin'
any place that night, nohow, ya know.  An' so I was back at the 
house an' me an' Miss Alice sittin' around  talkin'.  We was in
there jus' havin' lots of fun; we had lots of fun together.  An'
we was sittin' around. 
[*doctoring Catherine*]
 She done got to where she could walk.  I
sent to -- I went out in the woods an' got her some herbs for her,
ya know.   An' I bathe her an' I give her tea, that I knowed, that
was good.   An' so I, one night -- that was long before this night --
I had a lil' dream in my mind to do.   An' I sent [to] -- I wrote
to Fitzgerald for a doctor I knew there.   You know, a herb
doctor.   That was Dr. Bell.   An' I tol' him to come.   An' I
tol' him to let me know an' everything.   An' I met him at
night, an' he come there, an' we kep' him hid there, ya see.   An'
he doctored on Miss Alice -- that was the point, ya see -- an' he 
doctored on her an' he got her up.   An' he showed me, you know
how to give her her medicin an' everything.   An' he lef'.   An' me
an' Catherine husband paid him.  You see.  You know, I help pay
for it 'cause Cecil'd give me what I wanted, you know, as far
as he could, an' so we paid him.   Miss Alice was not able to
pay him, you see.   An' so we did that.  Miss Alice got up to where
she could walk from that quarter all the way out to the other
plantation to see her baby.  She hadn't seen her baby in two years.
Tha's right.   An when they seen her walkin' an' goin out there --
walkin' around there an' could wear shoes, that same crew in there
