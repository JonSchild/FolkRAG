Among other things we have recently
discovered that it is forbidden to take all
your clothes off at once in a German youth hostel.
Maidens and men undress in complete
or partial modesty with much clinging
to of garments and everyone takes 
showers with their bathing suits on.
It seems that before Hitler everyone in
Germany went swimming in the nude,
causing all the tourists to rush home
greatly scandalized. So when Hitler took control,
with customary thoroughness he decreed
that nobody should ever take all his
clothes off at once in Germany. Now all Germans are
erotically self conscious about their bodies.
A[nd] young American girl travelling with
her husband told me that he was taking a
sponge bath in the wash room of the boys Jugendherberge
when a German boy walked in.
The Hitler Youth was so embarrassed he slammed 
the door and ran. What price cleanliness I say when
you have to take a bath in your bathing suit. Much much love, 
Bess
