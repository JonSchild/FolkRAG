shape or form, you know through madness, to call somebody sumpin'.
That's what hurt me so bad, somebody call they wife or they husband
all kinda n-nasty things an' then go lay down wit' 'em.  Well,
you wit' that same thing; you lower'n that thing is!  You know,
that you call 'em.  That what I figure; jus' as dirty as that
thing.  I [tel' the] tell peoples, "If you call 'er a ol' so-an'-so an' 
then you go lay down wit' 'er, you go...she, she, if she is a 
bitch, I'd like to know what you is, if you'll lay down wit' her."
See?  I don't like that.  Don't call nobody them things.  Then you
go there an' wallow with 'em, too.  You wuss den dey are. 
Tha's why I thanked God that George never liked to cuss me 
neither.  We jus' was right for that.  I ain't never called 'im
nothin' 'bout his name, never.  He never caught me nothin' 'bout
'is name.  [I mean] 'Bout my name.
