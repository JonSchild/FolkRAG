October 30, 1942


Dear Mr. Salmon:

In your recent letter, you requested information 
concerning Army troop movements, particularly in
relation to a rumor concerning the transportation of
the newer troops. I would suggest that you refer this
inquiry to the War Department or their local public relations 
office for an official statement.

We learned of the Rumor Clinic established
by the Lions Club of Columbia through various advance
news announcements, and were very much interested in it.

Some material is at present in the process of
preparation for facilitating the sort of work that you
seem to be to be engaged in. As soon as it is ready, it will
be sent to you. Meanwhile, I would appreciate it if
you would send me your past releases and continue to
send me, if it is not too much trouble, copies of your 
future output. 


Sincerely yours,


R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
