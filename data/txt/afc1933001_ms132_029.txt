Mr. Robert L. Day
4465 Eastern Avenue
Cincinnati, Ohio

Dear Mr. Day:

I hope you haven't changed your plans 
about coming to Washington.  I want to see 
you again and we have the pallet on the floor 
already made up and a abed spoken for at a 
friend's house.

Thank you again for the fine contribution 
you made to the Library and the Archive; your 
songs will have a chance to outlive our grandchildren.  
Give my best regards to your family.  
Elizabeth and I both felt the world a more pleasant 
place to live in after our delightful visit 
with you all.

Sincerely yours,

AL:ed
