Dr. Watts in their education and
they don't use them. The last 
preacher we had used the organ
even in revival, [it] let it do all 
the words, but their preacher have 
now uses more Dr. Watts. We open 
the 8 o-clock service with one, have
prayer & scripture reading, another 
Dr. Watts and then the organ comes
in - plays a prelude or sompin' nd then 
like that. I don't like it and a 
lot of others - we got about fifth 
or sixth grade education, but 
this is ten or twelve graders, these 
professors, they like it.
"My mother used to call me
in when I was a little slip of
a boy to sing a Dr. Watts when
she prayed for the older boys that
was off from home."
It's been 20 or more years since the hollies were much 
used. I don't know why
