owners of the sixties and the hill country farmers of 1936 is
hardly fair to either. Nor does Mr. Hudson mention the poverty
and hopelessness of any of his informants, although I have found
that those people were much more eager to talk about the meagerness
of their lives than about ballads.

Indeed, what appears to be a lack of field experience detracts
greatly from the interest of even the portion of the book reserved
for song texts. The reader will find variant texts for twenty-seven
Child ballads, for numbers of the English broadside ballads,
for cowboy songs, for bad man ballads, play party songs, etc. --
the usual, and by now expected store of Southern folk-songs. He
will, however, discover none of the modern folk material that
would give him an idea of how folk-song is now growing and changing
in Mississippi. After looking over the texts in Professor Hudsons
book one has the feeling that folk-singing has been on the 
wane ever since the Tories came to Mississippi, fleeing from the
revolution, and that the last twenty years has produced nothing
better than a very sententious bad man ballad or two. Perhaps
this is true of Mississippi, but it is not the case in other
Southern states where collectors have been at work. The fiery
Holiness minister and his guitar-picking wife, the Negro blues
singer, that travelling band of "hill-billy" musicians, the indiginous
union organizer, all these are characters, mouths through 
which American folk-song is growing.
