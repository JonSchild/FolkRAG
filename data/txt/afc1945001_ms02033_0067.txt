Mr. Eugene L. Horwitz
Office of War Information

Washington, D. C.

Dear Eugene:

     Enclosed are two anti-Semetic poems
currently being circulated in Boston. It is
material of this kind which has persuaded me
that active steps must be taken to discredit
the anti-Semetic rumors in this area. The
first poem, AMERICA'S FIGHTING JEW has been in
currency here for two months. It was passed
out on street cars, subways and in defense plants.
The second poem, I know less about. It was referred
to us only today.

Yours,

Bob
