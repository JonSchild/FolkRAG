Heber Springs, Ark.

Dear Almeda,
I'm slowly working out the complicated problem of
getting all the recordings I made this summer published.
So far I have arranged to put all of the children's
material which you sang into an album of children's songs
from all over the South, really a delightful collection
which should get them and you to a large public. The songs
will be copyrighted in your name, and thus you will
receive both writer's royalties and performer's royalties.
In addition, I will pay you an advance at the rate of
$12.50 per song used in this first series of LP's which
will be published by Atlantic Records. The rest of your
songs I will certainly be able to sell to another company,
but what the rate of advance will be I don't yet know.
However, I'm including all of your song titles in this
formal letter of contract between us, so that I will be
free to market them for you to our mutual advantage
without more formal papers. Please sign and return two
copies of the enclosed contract right away, keeping one
for yourself. Later on you will receive publisher's
contracts covering your ownership of copyrights on your
material. I've written John Q. Wolfe about this and let
him understand that he will always have the right to
publish the songs he has collected from you in his
scholarly books, so that this arrangement won't interfere
with his plans.
The songs included on the children's album are: -
1) My Little Rooster; Frog Went Courting; 3) Mama Buy me
a China Doll; 4) Chick-a-li-lee-o; 5) Go Tell Aunt Nancy;
6) Nishi had a Mama. So this means you'll be getting a
nice check soon after you've returned the contracts.
Much love and merry Christmas
from Shirley and myself,
Alan Lomax.
