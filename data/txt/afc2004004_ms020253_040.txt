[*SPEAKING IN TONGUES*]
repentence, that time you did that four days' repentence?  When
you went on a fast for four days?
BJ:  Oh, yeah, um-hum.
TL:  And, ah, this was, you were saved before this.
BJ:  Oh, yeah, uh-huh, I was saved.  Yeah, we jus' sent on a fas'
'cause that was something -- I went on a fast to see whether I
be baptized, I tol' ya.
TL:  Well, somebody came in right in the middle of it.  You didn't
get to finish it.                            talk about it again.  You
said something about. . .
BJ:  That's the time I went to my sister-in-law's house an' she
was talkin' about, she had been saved, the, uh, three years, an'
diffrunt things that she thought that peoples shouldn't do.  You
know what I mean.  But what I meant, she said, we was talkin'
about speakin' in tongues, unknown tongues, ya know.  Well, the
Lawd gives some peoples more tongue than others. Ya understand?
An', ah, so sometimes folks speak, speak unknown tongue[s] when
they get saved?  An' it be a long time before they speaks again.
That's the evident of the Holy Gho[d]st.  Tha's the witness of the
Holy Ghost.  Ya see?
TL:  Well, are they quiet?
BJ:  No, when ya speak a unknown tongue.  Tha's what. . .
TL:  In unknown tongues?
BJ:  Yeah, uh-huh.  An' so. . .
TL:  What's that?
BJ:  I'll show it to ya.  An' so, when they speak in tongue[s], why,
then they are baptized within.  If they speak in tongue[s]; I don't
mean jabble.  You speak in tongues, why, you are baptized.  An',
now, tha's the inward soul shoutin', ya know.  An' that inward
soul is speakin' to God, an' no one know what [he] hit say but God.  Ya
see?  An' so, unlessen God give you or me the interpretation.
