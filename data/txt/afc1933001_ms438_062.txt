Whichaway Do de Red River Run?

"Whichaway do de Red River run?
Whichaway do de Red River run?
Some say to de Eas', some say to de Wes',
But I b'lieve to my soul it run down." *

Likely, this much repeated Negro wheeze originated in the famous
controversy between Texas and Oklahoma over which fork of the Red 
River was to be the boundary between these two states. That Oklahoma
won the arguments and a considerable slice of West Texas does
not concern the Negro folk-singer who has settled the dispute in
his own way. Most singers,  Lead Belly included, have no
explanation to offer as to the meaning of this stanza;
it is merely part of their tradition, and happens
to be attached to a good tune, and is certainly old - old, as Negro blues go, because of
[the] its primitive , unrhymed stanza form, and the fact that it is found
in folk-song collections made in Texas from 1904 to 1907.
