[*Share Cropping*]
BJ:    That's right. Three miles from town -- the further I ever lived
from town when I raised up.
AL:    What'd you do -- cotton?
BJ:     Cotton, picked cotton,  y' know.
AL:     On shares?
BJ:     They farmers, that's right.  On shares.  That's right Sharecroppers, they call 'em.
AL:    What was the -- one-third share, or...
BJ:     Well, [there] this was half shares.  'Cause they raised all their own
hawgs an' their own cows an' like that...See I was raised up with plenty out there to eat.
AL:     did you stay on the same place for a long time or did he move 
around?
BJ:     Oh, they move around mostly. [Tell you the truth... like every year] say two years or a year
or so they...You know how, farmers, the men they get together and see how 
[how] you's a great farmer, an' if they can they [tell you how] always did that, they get  [rich] witch you
in town, tell you how "I can do better for ya'; I can do this," and
getcha to move and [all] that.  You go up there and try him, and maybe
you don't like him, maybe, you know?  And you might like him all right,
too, but you['d] may rather be back with the other, an' you go back with
the other. Papa did that for years. [And] from Brownwood went to Dawson. [Ha,]
[ha, and] from Brownwood [went] to Dawson. Right straight from old man [name was] Amos
Fleming [or a] and man John Smith and that back down to the Diller Place.
AL:    Which one would cheat you the least, huh?
BJ:     Yeah, I guess so.  Cheat you the leas', maybe 'n you could ah.  But Papa he had
it grand with them all.  He was a great farmer and great worker anâ€™
if he wanted money down through the year its the curious thing -- he couldn't do it now to
save his life; nobody can do it hardly around there -- but Papa would do it,
an' he never got in jail or nothin' like that.  But he wanted money
through the year, down through the summer, didn't have no money, and
he had a run in the store all the time -- they called it a run --
and go to the store and get cloth and different things like that and
take it up on time for the winter you know.  You'd have to pay for it when
the gatherin'-up.  And so Papa would go in to somebody and sell them --
them white peoples' cow, hawgs, anythin' [ya'] he want.  [He owe] You know he mortgages,
however.  And never got [gypped] in jail by it.  When a man come [up the store] after the stuff
[he do] it would be just what he said.  I 'member he mortgaged a cow name of
Belle. [A] It was Jersey cow?  Black and white spoted.  And Papa mortgaged
that cow[.] 'n He called just direct how she was an' everything. 'n  The
