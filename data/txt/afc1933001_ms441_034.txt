Billy in the Lowlands

Lead Belly's favorite work-song after Julie Ann Johnson,
[the]both similar, both typical of the simple, rythmic worksong 
melodies of [the]Texas prison [camps]farms, is "Billy in the Lowlands". The leader,[gives]
as usual, gives out the [li] verse, at the [[?]]end of which
all the axes [hoes or whatnot] or picks fall together. The gang comes 
in with the "O Lawd, Lawd, Lawd," just as the force of the
stroke is exhausted and the axes fall again with the last syllable The leader begins the repetition of the
verse, finishes[s] it with the help of the gang and the axes
fall again. [Just as before the gang]The gang [ends]completes the
stanza with an "O Lawd", [as the axes rise] and the axes drop again.[at the end]
With each axe-stroke there is a violent ex[a]halation of 
breath.
