4)  I slapped my arms aboot her waist, and frae her feet did slide, 
And ther she lay contented on Kearney's burnie side.

5) But when her father heard o' this, he swore he was
Says, "You've beguiled my daughter, my sorrows all begun."

6)  For it's nine long months had passed and gone, she brought to me a son,
And I was quickly sent for to see what could be done.

7)  They said that I would marry her, but o that wouldna be.
Saying, "You're no match for her, nor her no match for thee."

8)  But noo she's got another match, her father he can tell,
That never got the maidenhead o' Bogie's bonnie belle.

9) But noo she's married a tinsmith and lives in Huntley town,
Makes natty lamps and ladles, aye, to all the country around.

10)  For the powers above protect this girl and keep her right and fine,
And keep her all from danger who has this heart of mine.

11) And keep her aye contented and always free from pride,
but I'll return to Bogie's land on crooked burnie side.

12)  For its nine long months has passed and gone, he gaed as he could tell,
For noo she's mistress Bearman, nae mair she's Bogie's Belle.

Green either.

Lomax: Have you any more in that same subject ? That's an awfully
good subject for songs.

McBeth: That's quite true, that.

Lomax: I thought the farm boys and farm girls slept together
in the bothies at times ?

Lomax: But they used to ?
