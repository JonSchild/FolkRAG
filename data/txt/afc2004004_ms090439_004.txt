Harmonica, poot, tincup on top of the stick
A [glo] growly, ghostly voice - 
Well, I heard it down at my home at my
church, that was
A voice as tentative as spring rain - 
My favorite is bout when I lay burden down
I'll so Fences, hallelujah
When I (harmonica)
played with vibrato
I'm goin home to live, a with my Jesus
When I lay my burden down
This song I heard -
that mean no mo trials & in no mo tribulations - 
Have you had many?
Yessir, yet un still I make it through
somehow or nother After you lay your
burden down, there'll be no mo trials & you'll
be goin home to a restin' place - It'll be
like over in Paradise - 
I
