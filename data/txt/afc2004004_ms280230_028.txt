The Wark of the Weavers:
1) We're all met together here to sit and to crack,
Wi' glasses in our hands and our wark upon our back.
There's nae a trade among them all would neither mend nor make
If it wasna for the work of the weavers.
Chorus:
If it wasna for the weavers what would we do,
We wouldna get cloth o' our wool.
We wouldna has a coat neither black nor blue
If it wasna for the wark of the weavers.
2) There's hireman chiels they mock us and crack aye aboot's,
They say that we are thin-faced, bleached like loots,
And yet for all their mockery they canna do without,
Nae, they canna want the wark o' the weavers.
3) There's our sodgers and our sailors, we make them all bold,
For if they didna get clothes they coulda fecht for cold,
And last of all, the king himself, though noo he's getting old.
But weel he kens the wark of the weavers.

Nicky Tams:
1) When I was barely ten years old I left the parish school.
My parents feed me to the mains to chew my milk and meal.
I first put on my narrow breeks to hap my spinnel trame,
And buskit round my napping knees a pair o' nicky tame.
2) It's first I gaed for bailey's loon and syne I got for third.
And ayne, of course, I had to get the horseman's grip and word.
A loaf o' bread to be my piece and a bottle for drinking drana,
Ye couldna get through the cattle court without your nicky tams.
3) The fairmer I am wi' the noo, he's wealthy but he's mean,
Though corn is cheap his horse is thin, his harness fairly deen.
He gars us load our cairts ower full, his conscience has nae qualms,
When breast straps break there's nothing like a paur o' mikcy Ta
4) I'm courtin' bonnie Annie noo, tho' damsel ticht she be,
She is five and forty and I'm but seventeen.
She clorts a muckle piece to me, wi' different kinds o' jams,
And tells me ilka nicht that she admires my nicky tams.
5) Ae morning I put on my claes, the kirk for to gang,
My collar it was uncou' tight, my breeks were nane ower lang,
I had my bible in my hand, likewise my book of psalms,
When Annie roars, "Ye muckle gowk, take off your nicky tams."
