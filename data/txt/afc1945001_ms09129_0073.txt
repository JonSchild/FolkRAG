A soldier I write to was telling me
about the time he was in Panama. He
said he'd liked it real well if it wasn't
for the fact that it was so hot and
rained all of the time and also the
fact that he simply hates rain. He was
born in the North in a town which is
usually very cold and he just about died
down there in Panama, because it was so
hot. He just loves to walk in the snow,
and he really should have been sent to
Iceland - not Panama.
