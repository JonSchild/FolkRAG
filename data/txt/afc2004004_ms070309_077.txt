You Don' Believe I'm a Child of God
My aunty was a terrible singer - we chillun
didn't git to go to church -

Free At Last -
And the old women would just jump up over
us chillun and sing - they shake hands &
git to rockin' it -
I played "ring-plays‚Äù since I been
goin' to church - sang when I was a child
See - a day, mockin' bird
Goin' to Little Rock Sho, Sho - [when I was] that came
in here since I come up.
Married when I was goin' on 15 years & my husband died in '25  
Them old liscense done laid down in the trunk till
They done got mouldy - but they's they - member
the man that married me - Squire Frenchy -

[?]alls stories to us -- my
daddy was a great man to talk 'ligion --
after they talk 'ligion a while -- my
aunty would jump up an a little song --
then they'd begin to pray -- my daddy
a grouchy man, didn't believe nobody
would do anything better than he could -- wd
begin Fountain Fill with Blood -- wd begin
to sing & shout & have church night there -- us
chillun wd wake up and look --
