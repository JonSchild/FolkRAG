Dear Mr. Lomax:
I have heard your programs on the radio and 
am much interest in fold-music. I have collected 
about fifty songs and ballads in western Massachusetts, 
the Hudson Valley, and northern New Jersey: old 
English ballads, folk-songs, sea songs, war songs, 
and ditties. Unfortunately, the people up this way, 
in the more populated areas, do not snig the songs 
to me but recite the words as I copy them down. 
"Barbara Allen," and "Lord Lovel," and "The Hang-man's 
Tree," have escaped me.

Much to my surprise I found "The Waxford Girl" 
only twenty-five miles from Newark, New Jersey. 
And I found a revised version of "Our Goodman,"- - - 
only a fragment - - - turning it into a Revolutionary 
War song. Proffesor Harold W. Thompson told me it 
was an unusual piece. I have "The Lady Mohee" 
and "Young Charlotte." One that I have "Young Mary" 
I have not been able to find recoreded anywhere. 
"Billy Boy" is an old favorite but I found an entirely 
different song of that same name in New Jersey.

At present I am working on a book of folk-lore, 
local history, and outdoor life, and I am going to 
included most of my songs in it. It sure is interesting 
work and educational, too. I liked the program 
you had on not long ago on the "American School 
of the Air" of the French Canadian songs.
Sincerely,
Harold Nestler
