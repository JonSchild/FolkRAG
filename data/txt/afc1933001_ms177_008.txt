Dear Mr. Brandon:
I judge from a letter from my father
that he wishes to be compensated for the
use of his song, "The Gray Goose", published
only in his book, American Ballads and 
Folk Songs.  He has authorized me to set
a fee for this use.  It seems to me, in
view of the fact that your film is completely
experimental, and for educational
distribution only, that a proper figure
might be $25.00.  I suggest that you
mail him a check for this amount.
I am still anxious to get the opportunity
to review your film here in
Washington.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
