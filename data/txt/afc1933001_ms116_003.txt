My dear Mr. Lomax:

    I trust that the inclosed letter to General
Calixte will be of some benefit to you. I am sending 
a copy of the letter by air mail and it should
reach General Calixte before your arrival. I trust
you will have a delightful and profitable stay in 
Haiti. Wish I were going with you.

    Yours sincerely,
