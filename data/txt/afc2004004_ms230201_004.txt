The Kid:...(interrupting) feelin' sad you play the blues...if
                your wife left home an' did you wrong, something
                like that. I mean...
Natchez:  Yeah, I agree, Kid, the blues helps anybody to explain
                 their feelin's...
The Kid:   Especially, if you're a blues singer...
Natchez:  But the main thing is---why the blues?  Why fellas gits
                 a-holt of the blues?  Why do he have the blues?
Sonny:      I think this.  I think after a man---Like you're down
                 South, you know---work hard all year an' you
                 expectin' your money once a year, an' when that year
                 winds up, then you don't git nothin'....
Natchez:  That's right. That's the truth.
Sonny:     (Plowing right on)... You know. You know? ... you done
                worked hard all year and then you get that idea that:
                [xx] I ain't doin' no good no way an' what's the use
                of livin'? n' you'll have all them funny thoughts
                like that.
Natchez:  (softly) Sho! Sho!
Sonny:     And that gives you the blues...
                I got worried blues and the po' man's heart disease..
Natchez:  Why is it... why is it, when a fella is going down some
                country road, whistlin' and singin' the blues, where did
                he get the idea?  He don' play no instrument or nothin'. 
                He just hollers, sumpin like...
                               Hey-ey, I feel like hollin'
                               Lawd, an' I feel like cryin'...
