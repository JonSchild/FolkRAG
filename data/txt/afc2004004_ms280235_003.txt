Her Mantle So Green:  Music 
1) As I walked out one evening in June, 
To view the fine parks and the meadows in bloom, 
I spied a young damsel, she appeared like a queen, 
In her costly fine robes and her mantle so green. 
I stood in amaze, I was caught by surprise, 
I thought her an angel that fell from the skies, 
Her eyes like the diamond, her cheeks like the rose, 
She's one of the fairest that nature composed. 

2) Says I? "Pretty fair maid would you come with me ? 
We'll join in wedlock andmarried we'll be. 
I'll dress you in rich attire, the fair like a queen, 
In her costly fine robes and her mantle so green." 
She said, "My young man, you must be excused, 
For I'll wed no man and you must be refused. 
The green fields I'll wander, the sun all in bloom, 
For the lad I love best lies in famed Waterloo." 

3) "Since you will not marry, tell me your lover's name, 
I have been in battle, I might know the same." 
"Draw near to my garment and there you will see, 
His letters embroidered in my mantle so green." 
In the ribbon of her mantle 'tis there I behold 
His name and his surname in letters of gold, 
Young William O'Reilly appeared in my view - 
He was my chief comrade in famed Waterloo. 
And as he was a-dying, I heard his last cry, 
"For you, lovely Nancy, I'm willing to die." 
And that is the truth, the truth I declare, 
Here is a token, a gold ring I wear.

Going to Mass Last Sunday:  Music 
1) And I going to mass last Sunday 
When me true-lover passed me by. 
And I knew her mind was altered 
By the rolling of her[e] eye. 
Fare-thee-well, my love, 
Fare-thee-well, Agrah, 
Fare-thee-well, Ballynakill's hills. 
And I going to mass last Sunday, 
When me true lover passed me by.
