1. During general housecleaning one roommate
had moved all clothings and furnishings in
front of the door so that the door was
concealed. The other roommate upon entering the
door remarked "Why don't you join the
"Camouflage Division of the Army for I think
they need your service?"

2. On eating some peanut butter combined
with syrup during mealtime one individual
