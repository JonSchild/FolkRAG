Gentlemen; 
I have made a few observations 
which might be of interest to you,in connection 
with your interesting Folk Dance Study. 
All of my childhood was spent in 
the Adirondack Mountains,and for four years,we lived 
on a farm.It was here that I was introduced to this 
typical form of music, the Square Dance. 
Being near the Canadian Border, most 
of the "callers" were French Canadian,and they had 
thier own peculiar "lingo". To this day,I find myself 
interpreting the calls I hear into this samedialect
and it adds greatly to my enjoyment. 
The music seems to be played more 
"staccato" than that of the South.The tune is less
run together and takes on a more definate character. 
Just before we went to live on the 
farm I had been studying violin,and to some of these 
folks it meant one thing,that I was a "fiddler". I 
wasn't then but I soon learned to play well enough to 
get thru two changes and a breakdown,so the fiddler 
could dance. It was an enlightning experience,and one 
that still is with me,I can still play in this way. In 
fact, once a fiddler,always a fiddler. 
We often had gatherings at home in 
which one of my brothers pounded the piano,one strummed 
a four string guitar,one a spanish guitar and I my 
faithful fiddle. Frequently, in these gatherings the 
one fiddle was the only instrument to carry the melody, 
the other instruments, chording and keeping time.
One dance I attended in Kentucky is 
my only experience with Southern Dances,but there was a 
great difference in the form the dances took. In the 
north country we had just four couples and during the 
"two changes" each swain danced with his lady almost 
entirely,and during the "breakdown" he was priveleged 
to swing all the other ladies.In the dance in Kentucky
we all danced in a huge circle,and seldom saw our 
partners.One funny thing about this particular dance,was 
that a young boy played a guitar,and another a fiddle 
and both lefthanded,with thier instruments strung
accordingly,imagine my surprise when I tried to play 
Chicken Reel and found the "G" String where the "E" 
should be.
The tunes we played were "White Cockade",
Money Musk,Red Wing,Little Bo Peep,Hop Up ladies,and ,Oh
so many others.
