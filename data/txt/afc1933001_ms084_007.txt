really wonder how she will get
enough to eat to say nothing of
any thing else, as neither she
nor Mr. Tartt seem to get any help
from anybody-

It seems to me that with her
talent & ability there might be some
work that could be thrown her way,
in which she could realize some
money - but I do not believe she
would ever ask you about it- The
whole truth is, Mr Lomax, that
she needs help dreadfully and
needs it now- Is there something
you can do? If so I feel sure
that you will. Thank you very
much for giving this your sympathetic
consideration. Yours very truly,
Theo W. Little
