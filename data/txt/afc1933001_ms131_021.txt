MEMORANDUM

To
Dr. Harold Spivacke,
Division of Music.

The following items represent my suggestions necessary for the 
forthcoming recording trip to Indiana and for the immediate needs 
of the Archive of American Folk Song.

1) 5, 50ft. magazines of Cin√©-Kodak Kadachrome Movie Film
                                                    @ 5.00            25.00
2) 6 [12] pckgs., Presto Cutting Needles for Acetate
                                                     @ 2.65            15.90
3) Acetate discs
                              25,   6" discs  @ 0.40              9.00
                              10, 10" discs  @ 0.80              8.00
                            100, 12" discs  @ 1.00          100.00
4) Playing needles, red shank
                                         100 [pckgs.]                      . 75
5) Two 17 [19] plate, 6 v. storage batteries     17.80

In order to finance the forthcoming trip to Indiana, I should like 
to, request an advance of $100.00 be made against the per diem vouchers 
for the trip.  As surety for this advance, I have established 
a bond with the Fidelity Bonding and Deposit Company of Maryland.  The 
bond's no. is 4246269 and it is paid up to August 25, 1938.

I would suggest that the date of my departure for Indiana be moved back 
to the 25th of March, so that I may be able to visit the Ohio Valley 
Folk Festival which is being held in Cincinatti on the 27th of March.  
This festival, directed by the widely known collector, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, 
should afford some valuable recordings for the Archive's collection
