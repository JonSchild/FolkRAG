   This obscene ballad is derived from the English
ballad, the Ram of Darby, current in England for several
hundred years and current is a large number of refrains
and in a large number of forms of which the Didn't He
Ramble variant in only one.
   I shall expect a fee of $15.00 in return for the 
time I have spent in looking up material on this song.
I think the case is now conclusive.
                              
                                             Sincerely yours,
