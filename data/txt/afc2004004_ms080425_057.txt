in detail about this music, I love it, but I'm depending
on you two to explain a little bit.

Man #1:    For me, I think the collective memory, or something
like that was in me and when I first heard this music,
though I didn't grow up in it, I recognized it as being
something that spoke truth to me.   My ancestors are from
Alabama and some of them statyed there, some of them
went on toTexas, which is where I grew up.   I first heard
this particular kind of music at the seminary in Boston, and
the album you did, I now recall it was the White Spiritual
Album, was my first exposure to it.   A friend of mine, whom
I had known in Texas, and also gone to the same seminary in
Massachusetts, played me that record and said, have you 
ever heard any such thing as this?   He played "Antioch and
"Calvary" and I said, no, I never heard anything like that.
And there was a little sheet with the explanation of what
it was and who was doing it. . . . .       END OF TAPE   #222
