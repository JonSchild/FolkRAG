HARDIN       That poor man got them here with
an ox and that's the only time that I know of anybody found

LOMAX       Did anybody look for money out

HARDIN       Oh yeah. It's a lot of people
hunted for money, [UNCLEAR] money, they dug that.   When I
was a little boy they used to dig here, yeah.   Yeah.

LOMAX       But you don't know of anybody
finding any.

HARDIN       No. The only time they found
money is the time I told you, then.   And they said that was
a bunch of old men what come here with them shovels and had
Uncle Jake to come, yeah.   That must have been a bunch of
them old fellows from, from way back there, from old

know, on a stick, you know, how you could carry.
