COME ON FRIENDS AND LET'S GO DOWN
[Chorus]
Chorus:
Come [all] on you friends and let's go down,
Let's go down, let's go down,
Come on you friends and let's go down,
Down on the picket line.
As I went down on the picket line,
To keep them scabs out of the mine,
Who's a-going to win the strike,
Come on and [I'll] we'll show you the way.
Went out one morning before day-light,
And I was sure we'd have a fight,
But the capitalists scurvy (?) had run away
But we went back the very next day.
[Chorus:]
We all went out on the railroad track
To meet them scabs and turn them back,
We win that strike I'm glad to say
Come on, and [I'll] we'll show you the way.
[Chorus]
