boy here has been kind of. . .fall back on this fellow.  He
started me off forty one years ago and we kind of grew up
together so that's part of what we grew up with.
A. LOMAX
Well, shall we do one final tune, or shall we call it a day?
I'm happy myself.
RAMBLER
We could do one more.
RAMBLER #2
We haven't played you a Cajun waltz.
RAMBLER #3
"Te Petite T'emilon" (sp?)

Can you change places with him?
A. LOMAX
Are you ready?
CAMERA
I'm not ready.
A. LOMAX
One, two, three.
RAMBLER
The name of this number is "Te Petite T'emilon", and it was 
recorded back around the late '20's, so we're going to have
Edwin sing it for you.
A. LOMAX
What does that mean, "Te Petite, T'emilon"?
RAMBLER
It means "you're small and you're cute".  It's another one
of the Cajun love songs.
