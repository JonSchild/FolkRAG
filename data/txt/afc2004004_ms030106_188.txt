It was crazy about the first blues I ever heard
in the Tenderloin district & here's 
one of the first blues that I heard played
happened to be by a woman that lived next door to my god-mother's 
in the Garden District. Her name was Mamie Desm[ond].?
On her right hand she had her two middle fingers
between her fore-fingers cut off and she played it
with her three -- usually played a blues like this all
day long when she first would get up in the morning.

(Piano)

She would sing for us like this:

I stood on the corner, my feet was dripping wet,
Stood on the corner, my feet was dripping wet,
I asked every man I met: -

Can't give me dollar, give me a lousy dime,
You can't give me a dollar, give me a lousy dime,
Just to feed that hungry man o' mine.

I got a husband and I got a kid man, too,
I got a husband, I got a kid man, too,
My husband can't do what my kid man can do.

I like the way he cooks my cabbage for me, 
I like the way he cooks my cabbage for me,
Looks like he sets my natural soul free.

(Piano)

This is the way the upliftment of the real
blues when they was made into tunes.
