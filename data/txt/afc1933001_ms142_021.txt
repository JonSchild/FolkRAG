Mr. Alan Lomax - Page 2                     February 25, 1939

   Why did you send me the enclosed letter from the Department
of Labor?  You know that I don't sign well enough to substitute
for you!*

   I shall have your letter to Professor Thompson typed and
signed for you.

   I am pleased to hear that you are enjoying your work.  The news
about Elizabeth, however, shocked me.  Is she still in bed?

   Again let me warn you against undertaking too much.  Learn to
refuse certain offers no matter how attractive.

   The books you ask for are in constant use in the division so I
suggest that you purchase them or use the copies at the N.Y.P.L.
In an emergency, we might be able to let you have them for a week.

   With best regards,

Sincerely,

Harold

*P.S.  In answer to your telegram, I just want to say that your monthly
trip has already been approved in principle and it is simply up to
our mutual convenience as to when it should take place.  Let me know
immediately if you want to come by train and I shall send you
government orders for return trip ticket and pullman.
