LARRY:
And we had a happy meeting like all our meetings and I said something to him and I started to walk out the door, he was trying to laugh you know, but he couldn't, he was leaning over the chair he had his mouth open like he was bringing that laugh out you know. You were standing there at the kitchen.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes I was.
LARRY:
And I'm so glad my last meeting with him was a happy one, you know, then I was happy. Every time I think about it, I look up at one of my pictures up on my wall and I get a happy feeling and not a sad. Even when I went to the funeral and I saw the body laying there, I felt it was him in a way and in a way I felt it wasn't him. I felt like he was gone, and he was already sitting on the banks of the river. You know what I mean, He already there. What I saw was just something to see big old process of a funeral. I just felt good about the whole thing.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well it was one of his minister friends called me yesterday morning he says Mrs. Davis, I'm calling to see how the Rev. is getting along, well I had to wait for a few minutes to tell him, Tell, him. Well he called. I said Rev. Gillum I got sad news for you, I said he passed away, and he cried on the phone Why didn't you tell me, and I said I thought everybody read it in the paper and I couldn't think of nobody's address at that particular time, I just couldn't think of nobody's address at that particular time, I just couldn't think. But he was a close friend of ours, but we couldn't do anything about it.
