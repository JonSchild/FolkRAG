Next time you’re in Indiana: Richard E. Banta at Crawfordsville, Montgomery
County (home of General Lew Wallace, Wabash College and James Buchanan Elmore,
the Bard of Alamo) should be a good source for you. Dick deals in old books
and manuscripts and helps sell Wabash College to high school seniors and
College alumni; he has a wide knowledge of the state and an interest in
native ballads. He used to have a considerable collection of material.

At Bloomington you might look of Guido Herman Stempel, professor of
comparative philology at Indiana University. The last time I saw him was
three and a half years ago and his hearing was getting poor then, although
he seemed to understand when somebody said, “Have another”. He knows more
than a little bit about music and can give you plenty of good Hoosier leads
to folk music, I’m sure.

If you stop at Bay City: St. Stanislaus Church, largest Polish parish in the city,
has (or had a couple of years ago) several fine musical organizations—the
Young Men’s Choir and Choir Dzwon, notably. Paul Jablonski, Sports Editor of
the Bay City Times, a good friend of mine, will undoubtedly be willing to help
you meet the people who can be helpful and cooperative. From that point you
can very likely secure some introductions to Posen people who will help you.

I’ll be glad to give you a letter to Jablonski

Rev George Duquoi; Pastor
Notre Dame de la Visitation—Fr. C
