Mr. J.A. Lomax - Page three

I have a lot of other notions stewing in my head, but 
the foregoing seems more than any one person can do in a 
year. I am told I am to get a stenographer within ten days, 
but I doubt it. 
Write and let me know how you are. Me I am fine.

Much love,

AL a                 Alan
