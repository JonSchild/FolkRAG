FROM:  Aaron Barkan, Manager
              Ithaca, New York

SUBJECT:  Cooperation with Office of War Information

     In response to your memorandum of July 30, 1942 there are listed below the rumors heard during the period from 8/3/42 to 8/15/42 inclusive: -
     1. Ithaca, N.Y. August 3
         Inefficiency on government jobs. Man working at Naval Base under construction at Sampson, N.Y. has eight different bosses.

      2. Ithaca, N.Y. August 6
          Conversation by a man who had been at the Naval Base applying for work. "I think it's a racket up there. There are three or four thousand lined up waiting. Some come all the way from New York City. It cost them $20.00 a piece to get here. They get up here -- they have to pay $4 a week for a room, $15 a week for board. The say "10%" will be deducted for bonds, besides the social security tax and union dues. A man had to pay $.65 for bacon and eggs for breakfast. Some of them went back to New York. They figured what's the sense of working on defense if your going to lose money.

       3. Ithaca, N.Y August 6
           Many dentists who received commissions in the Army and who have been there over a year have never done any dental work for the Army. They are performing only minor medical services.

       4. Ithaca, N.Y. August 6
           During the blackout tests in New York City there was much panic and people became hysterical.
