They would be sitting pretty 
to be able to pass their troubles 
on to me. As for you 
and Ruth you could 
sit back and say "sue 
and be damned." Not any 
longer can they put you 
in jail for debt. But 
all my little savings 
are subject to execution 
on a judgment declared 
against me. I'll sign a 
paper saying that I waive 
any right I may have 
in the songs used in one 
radio performance on 
Columbia, and that I 
believe the material to 
be your and my property
