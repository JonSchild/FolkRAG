Rumor Report - First Section
KCB 7/31/42 and 8/5/42

In accordance with your letters of July 31 and
August 5, there is enclosed herewith the First Section
of our Rumor Report.
I am sorry this report was not forwarded to you
on August 8, as requested, but the delay was due to a misunderstanding,
as explained to Mr. Webber in my teletype
message of yesterday.
The Second Section of our Rumor Report will go
forward tomorrow, and will include rumors heard up until 
noon time.
Encs.
