        In addition, the building will serve as local art center
and recreation center. It will house the library and contain
the workshops in which adult education may proceed on a planned 
scale. It further has facilities for health activities
and children's nursery requirements.
        None of these activities will  be superimposed, but will
be merely stimulated over a period of time, after which they
will have their roots in the local community. 

FINANCING

A total appropriation of $1,000,000 is needed to finance the
ten centers. Each center will cost $60,000 for land improvement, 
building and supervision; $10,000 for contrast supervising, 
planning fees and administrative expenses; and $30,000
for the Federal endowment to insure complete operation for a 
period of five years.
