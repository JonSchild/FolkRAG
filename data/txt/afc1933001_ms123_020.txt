"THE INDIAN LADY"

INEZ BARRINGTON

Although Inez Barrington is the only White woman to have
lived with thirty-six different tribes of Indians she has been
named by acclamation by the thousands of children who have
heard her program as "The Indian Lady." Miss Barrington
has just finished a series of engagements totaling two hundred
different schools in the metropolitan and suburban districts of 
New York. She presents the life of the American Indian of
today through a beautifully illustrated travel talk in which you
follow with her the trails she has made, from the Maine woods
to the deserts of the Southwest; from the frozen Canadian North
to Iowa and Nebraska, from the Pacific Northwest to the Everglades
of Florida and to the Carolina mountains. The Indian
Lady is now planning to leave the New York district where
she has become the  most popular entertainer of all who offer
educational programs for children. She will accept engagements
for dates other than for juvenile audiences and is open for the
consideration of special events for children, Winter or Summer
and anywhere from Coast to Coast. Her itinerary is now being
arranged and information can be given concerning time available
in any city.
