Dear Carleton:
I have suggested a project for you to put in project form.  
If you have any notion that the City of New York would be interested in 
financing such a project and do you know about getting the money?  I 
think it would be safe, next week to start one on the work the consort 
has already done for us in New York City, and we have many willing experts 
to do the work analysis and publish the material.  May your folk song 
project go through your summer cady, and fly into Mayer Laguarida's office.
I understand that we will be in Mexico together.  I will tell 
you more then.
With best regards,
Alan Lomax
