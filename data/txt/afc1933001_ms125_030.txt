Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
Harlan, Kentucky

Dear Alan:

I was sorry to hear about your trouble with the machine but I hope
that you have repaired it successfully by now. I thought that you tested 
the endurance of the batteries before you left and found them satisfactory.  
Mr. Bond suggests that you purchase, in Kentucky, two additional automobile 
batteries which you think suitable for your purpose. Have the store 
from which you buy them bill the Library of Congress direct and you indicate 
on the bill that you have received the batteries in good condition. 
Have them send the bill to me so that I can expedite payment. Do not pay 
for these yourself. You will find enclosed a letter authorizing you to 
make this purchase.

In what way was Fuson's material unusable? I trust that you have not 
forgotten my advice about keeping politics out of folk-song collecting.
The reasons for my mentioning Fuson in particular is that I mentioned him 
in my recommendation to the Librarian and I hope that you have gotten at 
least some of his stuff.

The description of the material which you have already recorded sounds 
very interesting. You seemed to have misunderstood me though. An unpublished 
ballad is just as important to me as it is to Professor Smith or 
anyone else. I simply don't want you to get exclusive in your tastes - 
not that I really have any fear on that point.  By the way, when you have 
some spare time in the evening, sit down and write me a definition of "an 
English broadside ballad that is not in print."

It is impossible for me to advise you how to proceed. I should like
to have you get something out of every county and still take your time and 
do the places which you visit thoroughly.  If this is impossible, you will 
have to use your own judgment in deciding which is more important. Try 
to remember, however, that this trip is supposed to be the beginning of a 
nationwide survey. Please don't prove such a survey impossible by your 
own actions. Your visit was also supposed to have propagandistic value 
and bring in more material from others. This might indicate moving about 
a bit.
