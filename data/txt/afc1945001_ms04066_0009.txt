"An old woman who used to work with the Federal Writers Project
here and always dressed shabbily disappeared right after Pearl Harbor. 
She used to lend her library card to a man who is known to have borrowed
about ten books on it, all pertaining to bombs and explosives.  She has
since been seen several times with this man in Salt Lake and she now
dresses very well.  After she left the Writer's Project her next two checks
were mailed to her, but she never accepted them or had moved."  [*Salt Lake City Utah*] [*21*] [*8-3*]
