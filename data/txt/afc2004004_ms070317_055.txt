When I had privilege to walk these m-f streets
Meet all of my friends that I cd until
O boy, but when I fell, I fell so low
I didn't know I had a friend wd treat
me so
Until that ol' jailer slammed the j-h door
Boy, they had my trial & send me
out to that old [May?] prisoner
camp,
I went on out there & I worked, worked hard
none of you whores wdn' even send me a 
postal card.
But all now I'm back & free again
I got money and money m-f's to
spend
But now there's nothin' you whores can do
But stand back & wish me luck
For its more of you whores I wish to fuck
But now I wish you whores luck
