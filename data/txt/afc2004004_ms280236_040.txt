Lomax: That's obvious! (Laughter). You play a lot better
for that. Did you ever hear any whaling songs?
Robts: I say, you get a stand at the wheel half the night,
and get a chap on deck trying to sing and that, all
night, you soon learn it. If you're trying to sleep
and he's at the wheel. . . .especially if he don't know
anything else.
Lomax: When did you learn this song?
Robts: I was about fourteen I think. Fifteen. Fifteen
years old, I was.
Lomax: On board what ship?
Robts: The Water Witch.

1) O they call me hanging Johnny,
Away, hey-i-o!
But I never hanged nobody,
So hang, boys, hang!
2) O they say I hanged me granny,
And then me love so canny.
3) O they say I hanged me mother,
And me sister and me brother.
4) O they say I hanged for money,
But hanging isn't funny.
5) O we'll hang and haul together,
We'll hang for better weather.
6) O a rope, a beam, a ladder,
I'll hang you all together.
Lomax: What's the background of that song?
Robts: Well, it's supposed to be a tale of a hangman who,
with a bad enough conscience, went off to sea in a 
sailing ship, and after a time they knew he was a
hangman, and the story got around in the ship, and it
finally became a bad weather song, sloshing about round
Cape Horn, fed up, and no grub, and a head wind. You see,
they used to sing that, and blamed everything on to him,
bad luck, head wind, high seas, all the hangman's fault.
Lomax: They didn't pitch him overboard, did they?
Robts: Not that I know of. They might have done!
