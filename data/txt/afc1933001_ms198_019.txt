Dear Mr. Lomax:
    The Chief Engineer of the Recording Laboratory 
tells me that he can duplicate all the Archive's recordings 
by Texas Gladden and Hobart Smith on four full track 10" 
tapes at 15 ips.  The usual charge for this duplicating 
is $60.60, postage paid.

    If you wish to obtain these tapes please send 
us your check for the above sum payable to Music Division 
Library of Congress.  The tapes will be mailed as quickly 
as possible after receipt of your order.
 
Sincerely yours,
James R. Smart
Administrative Assistant
Recording Laboratory

Mr. Alan Lomax

Thanks for your letter.  The check is attached 
and I will let you know soon as to whether 
the tapes will be used for commercial purposes 
or not. At that time the $150 will be paid.

Yours Cordially,
Alan Lomax
