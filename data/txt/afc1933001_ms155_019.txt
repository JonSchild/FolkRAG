Dear Mr. Lomax:

Will you please tell me what you charge for
an afternoon lecture on American folk music, or some such
topic? We heard your father many times, and enjoyed him
enormously. We have two of his books. My husband is Dr.
Brandenburg of the economics dept, Clark University, Worcester,
Mass. It was at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio that
we heard Professor Lomax.

The lecture I am interested in is for the
literature department of the Worcester Woman's Club. I
have not much money to spend. But I could plan to have you
when you were in this part of the country. There seems to
be considerable interest in the New England folk songs,
and people are collecting, singing, and publishing them
now. There is a Mrs. Charles Linscott who is collecting the
New England songs and ballads and has published a book
rather expensive, $5.

The fare from Washington to Worcester, as
quoted from this end, is $18.20. If you have engagements
at this end, you could let me know. Our year begins about
the first of October, lasts till about June 1.

Our dates would be Wednesdays, probably some t
time before Dec. 15. If you could not do it for our Wednesday
afternoon program, perhaps we could make another arrangement.

As I remember Prof. Lomax, it is with great
pleasure; in Oxford there were many negroes, and they were
allowed to sit up in the gallery at the lecture, once; they
heard him intone the one about the "water was cold and the
preacher was weak; and the nigger went to heaven from the
bottom of the creek." And for some time, we had a group of
very sullen negroes, because they thought we were making
fun of them. Finally, they began to be interested, and to
collect the songs themselves. Ridgely Torrence got some
