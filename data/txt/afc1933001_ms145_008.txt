My dear Mr. Lomax:
   I shall be in Mt. Pleasant this summer until August 4,
on which date I start for some folk collecting myself.  So I
can help you the middle of July, the date you suggested.
   Yes, I think the lumberjacks will still be extant by
that date.  Bill and Perry, two of our best sources, are still
lively.  Some of the other boys are quite willing to co-operate.
Henry Babcock, however, who I understand was not very friendly
last summer, is a person to avoid perhaps.  Something is eating
of the old gentleman.
   Let me know about when I can expect you.
Yours very truly
ECBeck,
E. C. Beck.
