                     Anecdote
             One day as a boy was washing
himself to go to school, and his mother
stood and watched him. He washed
his face and neck very good but
didn't wash behind his ears. His
mother asked, "Why don't you wash
behind your ears? There very dirty."
He said, "Im just being patriotic."
  His mother again replied, "How could 
you be patriotic if you don't wash
behind your ears?" He said, "Im going 
to build a Victory Garden, like
lots of people are doing.
