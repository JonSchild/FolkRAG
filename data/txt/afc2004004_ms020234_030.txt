[of that.]  He began to git so hongry that he had to eat some of 
the good husks -- they call it the husk -- the food that was set
out to the hawgs.  He had to pick the, the, the parts out [a] of
it that he could eat, an' eat.  He began to eat with the swines,
which was the hawgs.
         An' then he -- out there, while he was doin' that -- he 
thought on his way, by hisself, to hisself: "Here I is here
eatin' with swines, an' my father has ah, plen'y."  Ya see?  His
father was rich.  "I b'lieve I'll jus' rise, jus'..."  He make up
his mind, "I'm goin' back to 'im.  I'm goin' back to my father."
         An' he did. An' he went back to his father, see?  When 'e --
An' then, on the way, goin' back to his father, it musta been a,
a wide road or [sumpin'. This] something.  His, the Bible say the father seen 'im
a-far away coming an' knowed 'im.  An the father met him, With

be home, see?  Jus' hire me.  I'll do any work around here you'll
have me do.  'Cause I just done so bad."  Ya see all that.
          So his father take him home an' put him on a beautiful robe.
They had robes in those days, ya know.  What it mean, clo'es, now.
Ya see?  Father put 'im on clo'es.  An' put 'im chains around his
neck.  They used to wear beautiful things.  An' put a ring on his
finger.
          His other brother [is] was in the, still in the field, workin'.
