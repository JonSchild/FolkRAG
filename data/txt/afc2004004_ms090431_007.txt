[*Harper*]
Well, I began working in 19 and 9.
A:  What do you mean, working?
H;  I began writing poetry, ballads and stuff -- still copy different 
in the way of songs, ballads and things.
A: How do you mean?
H. I did the dictating; someone else the writing.
A:  How did these songs come yo you?  Tell me about the first song that 
you made up and how that happened.
H :  Well, the first song that I ever wrote was a song they called 
"Stand By Me When I'm Crossing Jordan River", and I wrote that, well
 I heard a man singing that song at a convention, a 'sociation, but when 
I went home I wrote it entirely differ nt.  It just come to me through 
the Spirit.  You see, I been converted for a good long time and it 
just come to me through the Spirit and I wrote it and talked to some 
people and they advised me to print it.  And I printed that and it 
made such a big song that I just began writing different compositions. 
A:  Do you remember how that first one went?
H: It went so mething like this:

When I'm crossing Jordan River,
Stand by me, Jesus.
He thought broke my chillin
Stand by me, Stand by me.
Now you are chillin cold
Now Jesus in my soul.
Lightnin flash, Thunder roll,
Stand by me, Jesus.

A: And it had a number of verses?

H : Yes, that's the first one.  The second verse was:
 
True hearts troubled,
Where you tribulation?
Stand by me, Jesus.
Made the false assucation, 
Stand by me, Jesus.
Trouble rank, move in sorrow, 
Lightinin tickin, thunder rolled.
I'm on my way,
It's so hard,
