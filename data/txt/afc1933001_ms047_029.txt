Dear Mr. Spivacke: 
I failed to send in some 
extra tacks for the machine I had 
bought in case of accident. I am 
expressing them to you Today. Alan 
should have them along in 
case of a breakdown far out 
in the mountains. As yet 
this Presto machine has held 
up without a moment's interruption. 
# 
Will you please consider  
and write me your opinion 
on this proposition? 
In case I come back 
[*over*] 
to Washington in [a] two weeks
