besides "posies" such as

"Round is the ring that has no end
So is my love for you my friend."                    etc.    etc.

The paper is yellowed with age and the edges of the 
the sheets are rather crumbly, but whether the owners would  want to part with it, even if it is worth placing in a museum, I don't know.  I know Professor Edwin Ford Piper, who instigated all interest in folklore and old songs, would have loved to have seen it if he were still alive.

I have copied about half the songs, so far (18) on the
typewriter, trying to keep Mr.  Larkin's spelling, as I am alomst
a fanatic on old songs myself, and I have a number of similar songs in my Missouri old-song-collection, many of them similar to these-- only a Missouri or Illinois version.  I also, at Professor Piper's suggested, while I was in his class, and since his death, have collected all the possible Northeast Missouri superstitions, strange old tales, home remedies, dance-calls (I have the hardest time getting these of anything, but a few rather original ones, I think.)) I have about 100 pages of Missouri folklore, myself, I suppose.  I have used a number of the most striking of the superstitions (not well known), dance calls, queer tales, home remedies, and old songs in a novel of the Missouri Cha riton Hill country, which has been accepted as a dissertation for a PH.  D.  degree at the University of Iowa, but which I am very skeptical of being published very soon, if ever, dwith war conditions as they are.

If you have any suggestions for either my Missouri folklore collection, and especially the old Iowa collection of Civil War songs, I would appreciate it if you would let me hear from you.
Thank you in any case.
Very sincerely,
