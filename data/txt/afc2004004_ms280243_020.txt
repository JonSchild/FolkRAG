TAPE 96. . .JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
The Twa Brothers:
1)  There were twa brothers at the school,
And when they got awa'
For it's will ye play at the stane-chuckin'
Or will ye play the ball?
Or will ye gae up to yon bonny green hill
And there we'll wrestle a fall.

2)  They wrestled up and they wrestled down,
Till John fell to the ground,
But a dirl fell out of William's pooch,
Gi'ed John a deadly wound.

3)  "O lift me, lift me on your back,
Tak' me to yon well sae fair,
Ye'll wash the blood frae off my wound
That it may bleed nae mair.

4)  He's lifted him upon his back
Ta'en him to yon well sae fair,
He's washed the blood frae off his wounds,
But aye it bled the mair.

5)  "O ye'll take up my holland sairk,
Reive it frae gair to gair,
Ye'll stab it in my bloody wound
That it may bleed nae mair."

6)  Eer he's ta'en up his holland sairk,
Reived it frae gair to gair,
He's stabbed it in the bloody wound,
But aye it bled the mair.

7)  "O lift me, lift me on your back,
Tak' me to yon kirkland fair,
Dig a grave baith wide and deep
And lay my body there.

8)  "Ye lay my arrows at my head,
My bent-bow at my feet,
My sword and buckler by my side,
As I was wont to sleep."
