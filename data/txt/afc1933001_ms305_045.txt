SAVE THE SPANISH REFUGEES FROM FRANCO

Read Douglas Jacobs' article on page 4 of this issue and you will know how imperative it is that
you continue and extend your help for the Spanish refugees. Help us now and help them by
doing your utmost to put into effect the following program:

1. Increased material aid from private sources.

Send us immediately as large a contribution as you can possibly spare.

Ask your friends to send us their contributions.

Get in touch with all organizations in your neighborhood. Tell them the situation of the
Spanish refugees and solicit their support.

Contribute to a Christmas gift of food, clothing, medical supplies, toys and books for the
Spanish refugee men, women and children.

Help us to meet the national quota of $50,000 which we must offer to the Spanish refugees by
January 1, 1940, in order that they can start the new year with life and hope.
