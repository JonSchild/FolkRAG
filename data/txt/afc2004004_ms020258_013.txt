O DEATH - Bessie Jones

chorus:  O death in the mornin' (3)
Spare me over another year.

1)  Well, Death walked up to the sinner's gate
Says:  I b'lieve you have waited now a little too late
Your fever now is one hundred and two
Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through.
He cried: O death 
Cryin': O death in the mornin'
O death, just spare me over another year.

2)  Hey what is this I see
Cold icy hands all over me.
He say: I am Death, no one can excell
I open the doors of Death in Hell. (chours)

3)  Now you heard God's people sing and pray
You would not heed, you just walked away,
You would not even bend your knee,
Now you got to go and come with me. (chorus)

4)  Well, I'm gonna fix your feet so you cannot walk,
I'm gonna fix your tongue so you cannot [talk] talk,
O close your eyes and you cannot see;
You got to go and come with me. (chorus)

5)  Well, Death,consider my age - 
And do not take me in this stage
Because all of my wealth is at your command,
If you'll just move your cold icy hand.  (chorus)
He cried: O no, O no
  Death in the mornin'
  O no, O no --
  Spare me over another year

6)  Mother standin' by the bed
Well, a aching heart and a hung-down head.
And thedoctor looked around very sad -
Says the worstest case I ever had. (chorus)

7)  He say:  Mother I got feets and I can't walk,
I got a tongue and I can't talk,
I got eyes and I can't see -
Nothin' but Death go t the shackles on me. (chorus)
