people. The reason was simple.  They were - 
they play square dances and jollifications at
the plantation houses, and, and ah, the white
folks were the ones that had the money.  As
Chapman practically remarked:  we could come
home with something in our pockets when we 
played, and his father was a fiddler, ah, with
his memory going back to the Civil War, and ah
the whole family was tri-musical.  They could
play guitars, banjos, the whole lot.  And they
began to pick up the blues that were / growing out 
of the levy camps and turn them, ah, to somewhat 
commercial purposes.  Ah, the Chapmans 
were the - one of the first groups to record
- the Mississippi Sheikhs, way back, before

hear.

Chapman ah remembered for us on our visit
there, Sitting on Top of the World.
