Mr. J. L. Morrill
Vice-President, Ohio State University

My dear Morrill:

I have just received your letter of March 15, which was
forwarded here from Austin and, for some reason, was not reforwarded
to me in Europe, where I have been travelling for
the last seven months.

I left the University of Texas in 1925, and since that
time have had a somewhat checkered career, the shadowed areas
being caused by the death of my wife, the break-up of my home,
and the ravages of a long and devastating illness. The last
two or three years, I have been book-making, the big job being
the collecting and editing of "American Ballads and Folk-Songs", 
which is known all over the world. The name caught
even if the quality of the book didn't (it is the recognized
standard in its field). I am just finishing Volume No. 2.

I certainly should have come to the convention had I
been in America, if only to see you, Shaw, Sailor, and many
others of the old crowd. Sailor also sent me an invitation
which I greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

JAL:ed
