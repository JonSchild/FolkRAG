BJ TAPE 14,  p. 16

AL:  Do you think dreams sometimes tell about the future?
BJ:  They does. Sometimes. Sometimes, um-hum. Um-hum. . .Ya know,
ah, that's the way the Lawd comes through, dreams.  So I ain't got
no fault with dreamin'.  An' so, so many dreams that'll ol'
prophet an' the same God, an' I ain't          dreamin'. (??)
But I don't believe dreams worth nothin' when ya all full up
with a whole lot a ol' kinda meats an' all kinds ol' stuff, ya
know!  Mean, plen'y a hawg meat an' you fill up with it.  Belly's
so full you can't, you can't git a dream through good.  I don't
b'lieve you can.  You know what I mean?  It's, it's, the devil
come in ya haid an' stay there a good time, um-hum. The spirit.
TL:  Do you ever dream about the past?
BJ:  What?
TL:  Do your dreams ever mean anything in the past, in  your life?
BJ:  Yeah, dreams mean a lot.  Ah. . .
TL:  Do you ever dream about what happened to you when you were
little?
BJ:  Oh, I don't think so.  I think it's a fahwa'd march.
TL:  What?
[*PROPHETIC DREAMS*]
BJ:  I b'lieve dreams is a fahwa'd march.  You know, sumpin' up
ahead. . .I mean sumpthin's ahead.  Sumpthin' to look ahead for.
'Cause they say, ah, back stand is second-handed (??) with God
an' God's the one that brings dreams through ya haid. All that
back stuff, that second-hand. Some done have dreams; ya goin'
over that.  I, I b'lieve it's a fahwa'd march.  That's what I,
that's what I believe.  So.
[*RECENT DREAM 1*]
AL:  What was your dream this morning?
TL:  Yeah, tell 'im about the dream you had last night.
BJ:  Just was right fruit.  A whole lot a ripe fruit, she had it.
Got a whole lot a ripe fruit, ya know.  Jus' fruits.  An' ah. . .
