Ole sis goose wus or sailin' du de lake, and ole Brer for wus
hid in de weeds. By um ole sis goose swum up close to der bank
and ole brer fox lept out an cotched her.

"O yes, old sis goose, I'se get yer how, you'se been 'or sailin'
on mer lake er long tim, en I'se got yer now. I'se gwine to break
yer neck and pick yer bones.

"Hole on der', brer fox, hold on, I'se got jes as much right ter
saild on der lake as you has ter lie in der weeds. Hit's des as much
my lake es hit is yours, and we gwine to take dis matter to der
cotehouse and see if you has any right to break my neck and pick my
bones."

And so dey went to cote, and when dey got dere, de sherriff, he wux
er fox, en de judge, he wuz er fox, and der attorneys, day wuz foxes,
en all de jurrymen, dey wuz foxes, too.

And dey tried ole sis goose, en dey 'victed her and dey 'acuted her,
and dey picked her bones.
