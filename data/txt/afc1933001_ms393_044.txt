difficult problem in music education is once and for all solved.  Americans have been taught that music is a non-functional decoration of existence with only a gingerbread fresco's relationship to it; they have been told that their own music is not music at all and that the only music worthwhile is something that is to be appreciated with closed eyes and a reverent finger to the lips.  This has caused hundreds and thousands of Americans to grow up with the attitude that I shared in my adolescence, that music is for sissies, and long hairs, and girls-- at the same time that they cling to a group of simple folk tunes that form the basis of music making for their growth.  I believe that the promise of American folk music in public schools can help solve this whole problem.

Once an affection for and an interest in folk song is established, once the child realizes that he too possesses such songs and can contribute to the musical life of his class and his country by teaching others his own songs, once he discovers that his own parents, grandparents, uncles, etc., possess music which is intrinsically worth while, once he fully understands that the music of his own community and his own racial, religious, or social group will be exciting stuff for his teacher, and his classmates, his whole attitude toward singing and logically thereafter toward all music making will change.  The most forward step in this direction will be taken when the attitude of teachers toward this material is changed.  The child in the child's community clings to its folk tradition in spite of the present educational system.  The teacher who decides to throw in his lot with the normal development of American folk music will at once find herself integrated with the musical interest and ideas of her community and much better able to understand the teaching problems at all
