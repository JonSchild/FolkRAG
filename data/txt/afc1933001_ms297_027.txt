U. S. LORE IS BASIS FOR
CULTURE, SAYS WRITER

BLOOMINGTON, Ind., June 30
(Spl.)  America
has accumulated a
collection of native stories on which
it can build its own art, literature,
 drama and music without further
recourse to classical examples of the
old world, said Carl Carmer, novelist
and nonfiction writer, at an Indiana
University convocation last
night which opened the university's
first summer institute of folklore.

Mr. Carmer, who is compiling
Hoosier traditions, habits and stories
for a book on Indiana somewhat
similar to his "Genesee Fever" and
"Stars Fell on Alabama," said the
Ohio River character, Johnnie Appleseed,
could inspire as great a
painting as "The Sower."
