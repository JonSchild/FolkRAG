AL:   And your family's been up there in northeastern Alabama
for a long time?  You know where your folks came from originally?

Ivey:   Not really, my grandpappy came from the Cumberland
Mountains and settles in there, he homesteaded, bought into
that land up there.

AL:   So you all are really from Tennessee theh?

Ivey:   Well, it's in Alabama, but it's right next to the
Tennessee line, over the Cumberland Mts.

AL:   Have you ever had what you might call a feud up in
that part of the world?

Ivey:   Not since I can remember.  They used to have them,
but not any more, I don't think.

AL:   But there still are feuds up in that part of Alabama.
What's the most famous one?

Ivey:   I don't really remember.  It's before my time, right.
Since I been big enough to remember, I don't remember any
around.  They used to tal[d]k about different families that
would get around to feuding with one another, and have problems.

AL:  How many children in your family?

Ivey:   I've got four children.

AL:   They all singers too?

Ivey:  A couple of them are real good singers. . . . . . . . . . . . .
Hardly ever miss a weekend.We usually go on Sat. and Sunday,
spend the weekend.  Then don't feel like working on Monday.

AL:   Thanks very much Mr. Ivey.
