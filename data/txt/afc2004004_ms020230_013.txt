out chere the other day? -- an' you was, ah, ah, on this ship, an' 
you had to get -- An' you's, uh, either you or anybody, was up on
that high mast pole.  That's jus', ah, you've see them high mast 
poles on the ships?    An' you had, you couldn't git down;  [ha] ya had 
ta fall.   What would you fall against?
AL:     When I fall down?
BJ:      Yeah, what would you fall against?
AL:      I'd fall against the deck.
BJ:      You might fall on the deck.   But I mean, what would you fall 
against?
TL:      Yourself.
AL:      I'd fall on my ass, wouldn't I?
BJ:       Hu!  Your ass what you'd fall on.   I say, what you fall against?
TL:      The air
BJ:      Well, you'd fall through the air.
AL:      I'd fall against my will. 
BJ:       That's cerrec' (correct).   Ha, ha! Tha's it!  Because she 
like to [have] had it, uh-huh, she say "against yourself."  Fall agains' 
your will, tha's right.  Heh, heh!   Tha's the truth. That jus' a 
good ol' question:  What would you fall against?
AL:      I'll ask you one now.   It's sumpin' that starts from 
St. Simons an' it's nekked.   And gets on the road and begins to 
put on its full clothes and it's fully dressed.  And when it gets 
over to Jekyll Island, it strips again.   What do you call that?
BJ:      Umm. I guess it must be the moon.  I mean the sun.
TL:      Hum?
BJ:      The sun, ain't it? Hum?
AL:      She leaves St. Simons she's nekked as a jay bird.  On 
the trip she's got all of her clothes on and when she leaves 
Jekyll Island she strips down again and shows the folks just what she is.
