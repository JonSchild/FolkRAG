Gentlemen:
I greatly enjoyed your program
on the morning of January 21 featuring
Voyageur Songs of the French Canadians. 
Will you please advise me if
these singers have made any phonograph
records of these songs, and if so, could
you give me the make and number of the
records?
Thanking you very much for this
information, and with best wishes for the
continues success of this interesting program,
I am,
Yours very truly,
B.B. Cubbedge, Jr.
