NOTES ON RUMOR STUDY

[*1*] The first thing of importance is to note that rumors can be
studied.  In Canada, the Committee For Morale makes a continuing
study of rumor and provides the basis for public radio addresses.
The two-week rumor study by the field staff of intensive surveys
were able to collect over 1100 rumors in two cities.  Our nationwide 
cooperating field staffs in the two-week period reported about
3000 rumors.  [While at this point we are not willing to provide a
final definition of precisely what type of material can most satisfactorily 
be called rumor, nor those rumors which would be of most
value to the Office of War Information, we can be confident that
rumors can be studied.]

[*2*] Rumors should be studied [*systematically*] for such a project would value in several ways.  [they are an important aspect of
intelligence operations designed to maintain maximum morale and war 
effort in our country.]  In Canada, experience has shown that rumors
can function to close important industrial plants for periods of
days, [simply on the basis of unfounded rumors.]  In New England, the
Survey study collected evidence which indicated that rumors are serving
to reduce the labor supply being made available in certain important
war industries.

[*Insert A*] There is some evidence reported by the Special Services Division
that there are rumor campaigns being initiated among some of
the leaders in anti-democratic groups.  For example, we have the
report that Mrs. Faber, President of the Mothers of the United States
of America, prides herself on her ability to spread rumors and to
encourage the others to do likewise.  Among the Italians in
New York there seems to be evidence of an inspired rumor campaign.
In addition there are rumors of rumor campaigns in various places.
Axis radio propaganda efforts aimed at this country seem to be making
a special point of deliberately planting rumors.
[*Â¶] Rumors apparently 
may serve as specific information which has an important
bearing on the way in which people will act.  They mold and guide the
development and expression of people's attitudes.  
Study of rumor should give us evidence concerning the spread
of anti-democratic campaigns, certain aspects of information which
people have in various fields, and in some cases reflections of
attitudes in ratter complex fashion.

It would seem feasible and highly desirable to establish a
continuous extensive study of rumors.  Such a study would serve a 
number of special functions within the Bureau.  It would give a check
on the currency of rumors which appear dangerous to [*the*] war effort and
provide the basis for some direct study of a local situation which
may have importance.  In general, it might give us clues to areas in
[* a Survey 7*] which attitude studies may be needed.  Comparison with Media and
Sources analyses should provide recommendations for the development
of informational policy which will be discussed more fully below.  If
a continuous rumor study is undertaken, it would be highly desirable 
to have occasional intensive studies by Surveys Division to re-check
on the function of rumor in the community to provide for a continued
improvement of [*the*] continuing service.
