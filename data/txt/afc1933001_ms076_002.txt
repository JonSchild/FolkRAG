MEMORANDUM

From
John A. Lomax Division
To the Chief of the
Dr. Spivacke, Chief ofMus. Division

November 22, 1940

Dear Dr. Spivacke: For the guidance of Miss Terrill and me in pre-
paring notes on recordings we have made for the Library of Congress,
Alan and I have agreed on the following points:
1. To work backwards, taking up first the last batch of records we
have brought in.
2. To use an entire page for the notes on each song, with record
number reference.
3. To prepare separate notes on sections, different types of songs,
communities, or other matters of general interest for binding into
a separate volume.
4. We shall need an additional number of duplicate records, an estimate
of which is being prepared.
In my own case I think, in the time limit we work under, I could
quadruple the amount of the notes if you could assign me a stenogra-
pher. I do not use a typewriter. Miss Terrill has been on only two
trips, I on six or seven. She has a typewriter and has many of her
notes already in shape.
    In any event, please know that you shall have the best efforts
of both of us.

    Yours sincerely,
    John A. Lomax
