Elmo Newcomer's Dance Calls--- b

(First Figure)

Pardners to their places,
Like mules to their traces,
Put your hands in your pockets,
Turn your backs to the wall,
Take a chew of tobacco,
And balance all,
Swing your pardners
Corners all
Now your pardners
And promenade the hall

First couple out to the couple,
On ^to the right, and round up four.

Elbow hug and Chinese swing,
Sandhill twist and a double swing,
On to the next, and the next
couple follows.

(Note: repeat clear around till the
last couple has finished)

Balance all,
Swing your corner and swing it
with[a] a smile,
Grab your honey and go hog wild.

--------

(Second Figure)

Everybody dance as pretty as you can,
Swing your corner wiht your right hand,
Pardner with your wrong,
Grand right and wrong all night long,
Watch your pardner, watcher her close,
When you meet her, double the dose.
Hang your dogs and kill your cats
And double the do se[w] with [ruff] Rough on rats."

Lawd, Lawd, ain't we got fun? (shouted)

Dance up, boys, and don't be slow,
All these girls are r'arin' to go,
All you gals who don't wear socks
Shake your hips and rattle your hocks.

Meet your honey and promenade home.

(Third Figure)

Swing on the corner like swingin' on a gate,
Now your honey and pull your freight.
First couple out the couple on the right
Lady around the lady and gents so low,
Lady around the gent and the gent don't go.
Swing with your right and now your wrong,
Doc[y]e ladies all night long.
On to the next, chase the possum, chase the squirrel,
Chase that pretty girl around the world
Ladies doc[y]e, gents cut a shine,
Swing your sweetheart and I'll swing mine.
On to the next and the next couple follow.
Chase the possum, chase the skunk,
Chase that pretty girl around the chunk,
Ladies doce[y] and gents go gee, 
Swing that pretty girl and then swing me.

(And so on until the last couple has gone around)

Everybody dance
Swing your pardner and promenade
the hall for the last time.
