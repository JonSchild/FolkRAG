[*A MYSTICAL PORTRAIT OF CHRIST]
BJ: [An'] Them that be's a sinner, it won't, I seed it,
myse'f.
AL: Where was that pitcure?
BJ: 'At was at St. [Simons] Clara, on the Island. Ah, at the Parker
House, you know? You know where the Parker House is there, don't
you?
AL: No. 'S right there on the Beach Road, the road goin' to the 
beach, off, off um, Demmey Road. Then you turn to East Beach. 
That big, ol' house sittin' there that corner, that's the. . . 
AL: Who was the man who took this picture?
BJ: Oh, he was a preacher from Ohio. I don' know what -- I forgit
the name now. I worked with 'im a long, good while. But um, he
um, he had this picture [in] there. He had, he had several of 'em,
but he havin' to send some of 'em an' he keep one. So I looked
at it, at that that picture. An' hit was a funny thing; it's a
curious pitchur. Called to be like the pitchur a Christ, was a 
dark, ya know, real dark, brownish-lookin'. An' ah, when you look
at it, jus' look at it real hard. An' if you's a, got Christ, if
you's a deep sinner, that pitchur, they eyes'll close up, an' if
you was a Christian, the eyes'll ease open. Great goo'ness alive.
AL: Was that a photograph or did he paint it.
BJ: I don't know whe' (whether) they paint it or what. They say 
it's jus' -- it's layin' down on the table there an' I went an'
looked at it. I was through with it. I'm tellin' you, I was
definitely through with it! I wen' in there an' looked at that 
thing, just what they was talkin' about. An' I stood there an'
looked at it, an' looked right at it right hard. An' you'll see that
they eyes'll kinda start openin' up. I lef' there before they 
were open wide! I was gone. . . . I . . . !
