Rumors are harmful to our war effort, and especially to peoples moral. his is a story that I heard, which I didnt keep going I immediatly crushed in. 
I went to a kids, house, and every one were sitting around talking, as I came in they were talking about meat storages. Immediatly,  after I sat down I was in the discussion. They were saying that we in America  were short of meat, yet they were sending the Chinese meat. [[strikethrough]]yet they[[/strikethrough]] who had never had meat before in their life, even they said sending the japs meat in our concentration camps. 
Those people didnt know, that if people should take the wrong attitude towards this, it would slow down our war effort considerably thus causing a great deal of harm to the fighting forces of America
