                  Mrs. Butler

            There was a woman who had
 been notified by the government that her
son had been killed on a certain front. 
This woman was so heartbroken that
everyday she would go to the Hine's Hospital
and take the wounded fighter's cigarettes
candies and such. There was a boy at the 
hospital with his arms and lip cut off.
She favored him above all the others. 
              One day when she went there he
told her that he had something to say 
to her. She told him she would come back 
so that he could tell her. When she was leaving
the boy called to her he said "Mom."
The woman turned around and looked 
at him and fell on the floor dead.
           This boy had been her
son whom she had thought was dead. He 
told everyone he did not want to live because
he had killed his mother. He said he
just couldn't stand there and see her
and not tell her he was her boy. He 
had been seeing her for nine months 
without telling her he was her son.
