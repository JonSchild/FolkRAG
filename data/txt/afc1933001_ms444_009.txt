SUPP. LIST  MAR 3 1942

February 25, 1942

Dear Alan:

The outline and material reached me this morning and looks
very interesting to me.  I will take it up at once with the 
other people here and let you know just as quickly as I can. 

I Di[d]ctated a letter to you yesterday asking you what had
become of it and telling you that a copy of OUR SINGING COUNTRY had
already been sent tot Charles Edward Smith in November and that I have 
[*sent 2/05/42*] had one sent to Taissa Hillman, as you suggested.  I also broke the 
sad news to you the tour review department is adamant about letting
review clippings out of the house.  There is a house law on this 
matter which, to my knowledge, has never been broken.  When your 
father was up a short time ago he culled out a great number of duplicates,
[*sent 2/25/42*] but there are a few left which I am sending on to you. The file is 
are any time you want to look at it in the house, and I am very sorry
not to be able to send it down to you, as you suggest. 

You will be hearing from me again very shortly. 

Cordially yours, 

Mr. Alan Lomax
