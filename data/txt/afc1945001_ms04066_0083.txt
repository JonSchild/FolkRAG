"I told Kay that people were talking about him being mixed up 
with the Japs as a spy and do you know what he did.  Went to his desk and 
brought out letters from the mayor and the chief of police and prominent 
men in Ogden testifying to his character.  Mrs. Kay cried right out when I 
told her.  She said, 'Why, Kay and I have lived in Ogden for 25 years.  
This is our home.  Ogden has been good to us.  Why do people talk like that?'
