AL:    You know, in a way, this is really modern music.  It's 
what people try to to write self conscously . . . . . But 
modernness really came out of a folk impulse.

Buell:    I can't really say much more about it than that.  
They took this nineteenth century church music tradition and 
modernized it, back to a folk expression.

AL:  Well, I'm going to be quoting you. . . . . thank you.

AL:    Was the singing up to what you expected?

Woman:    Oh yes, it was fine, it's always good at this church.  
Well, a lot of other churches, but it's always good here.  
Everybody likes to come here.  Really do.

AL:    And you were going to tell us a little bit about the 
history of this particular spot-- in the Holly Springs area.  
Do you know anything about who settled in here?

[*Will Rogers*]
Man:    I don't know who settled it but I know the type of 
people that settled it.  They were small landowners, and by 
being small landowners you had mostly one race of people, had 
small schools, small churches and the community pulled 
together.   It was a working force rather than it was where 
you had larger farms and larger plantations, because neighbors 
help each other.  More than likely this church was built by 
neighbors helping each other.  It wasn't in a building contract
