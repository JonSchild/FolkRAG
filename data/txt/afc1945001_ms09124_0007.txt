Small Town Boy.
This is a joke concerning the amount of money Uncle
Sam is taking out of everyones paycheck. The luxury
tax, war bonds etc. The scene takes place in a
small town down in Virginia. Bill Smith is
talking to his boss:
Bill: Boss, I'm going to quit my job and go up north
to Chicago and make me a lot of money. I heard
that they have a lot of defense factory up there
and you can make a lot of money.
Boss: Are you sure you want to go up there?
Bill: Sure, I'm not one to pass up a lot of money
when it comes my way.
Boss: All right Bill, you go on but I'll keep your
old job open so you can have it when you
get back.
Bill: What makes you so sure I'm coming back?
Boss: You don't know the north like I do. But go
on and good luck.

Bill left for Chicago and got a job in a
defense factory. He worked hard for a month,
always looking forward to pay day. When
pay day finally came Bill was a sad creature.
That night he left for home. When he arrived
at home everyone was surprised to see him.
