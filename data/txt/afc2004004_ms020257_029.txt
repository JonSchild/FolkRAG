Elisha didn't even know it.  He meant for these things to happen
jus' like He wanted 'em to happen.  God pricked his heart an'
made him have a mind, ya know, that Elisha need this money or
Elisha need these things; he oughta charge [this] that man.  See?  Why didn't
he [need] charge 'im?
     He go on an' git on his camel or hoss or whatever he had,
an' go around Nehmi-- ah, Naaman, an' overtake 'im.  An' told
'im that Elisha said he would take the price.  An' Naaman['s] was
glad to give it to 'im.  He thought Elisha said it, see?
He give it to him.  See, he told a lie.
     An' he carried it back to Elisha, an' gi' it to Elisha.  Elisha
asked 'im what it was an' he told 'im.  "I thought you should
have charged him,"  you know.  "You should have take pay for what
your," you know, "F-for your blessing."
     He tol' 'im, "I didn't charge 'im.  It was a blessin' of
God.  Now the same (the lepers, the lepers from him, you git
from ??) you."  See?  "An' your chilren, an' your chilren's
chilren.  Your hair," you know, how "your hair shall go straight,"
an' so on.  I'll read it to ya.  An' you'll fin' it out.  An', then, an'
[an' there] then he said, an', "Forever will be cheatin' an' swindlin'."  You see?  So
that where the cheatin' an' swindlin' come in at.  But he, but
he didn't kill 'im.  But, now, he said that the way they gonna
mix. (?)  See?  "That, that, that's your chillun."  Yessuh.
That's the onlies' thing that . . .(COMPARE WITH BIBLE:  THE LEPROSY
THEREFORE OF NAAMAN SHALL CLEAVE UNTO THEE, AND UNTO THY SEED
FOREVER."  AND HE WENT OUT FROM HIS PRESENCE A LEPER AS WHITE
AS SNOW. --With no mention of "Cheatin' and swindlin'."  REF:

can be found at least once in full on tape.  DH)
