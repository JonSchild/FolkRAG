spirituals? and could I have 
these spiritual records recorded 
for some reliable firm so that 
I could use their (the Negroes own work)
to help them selves with?
You see we are working to be
at the worlds fair in N.Y. in 1939;
Perhaps Washington could arrange
for a presentation, 
then the Library of Congress
could get evry type pf Negro
meeting and a hundred
spirituals if you want them.
I did not mean to take up so
