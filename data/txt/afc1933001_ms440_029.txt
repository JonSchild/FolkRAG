#2 - Mr. John A. Lomax.
The transcript of the record is
in the Court of Criminal Appeals at Austin. It will
show the facts on which Boyd was convicted. The
affidavit of the deputy sheriff will also appear
in the record there. I am writing Mr. Lloyd W.
Davison, Assistant Attorney General, in charge of
criminal cases as per copy of letter attached. If
he is not too busy it may be that he can and will
send you the information.
Mrs. Burford and I are both glad
to hear from you. I trust that this information may
be of some service.
With best wishes always,
Sincerely yours,
AL Burford
