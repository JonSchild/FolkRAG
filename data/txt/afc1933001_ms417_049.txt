SARA OGAN'S 
THE CAPITALISTS WILL FOOL YOU IF YOU DONT WATCH OUT
Sara's next song has got something of a 'modern twist' to it. I dont know exactly how to tell you about it, but from looking over the piece --- I judged that.
But the Capitalists will fool you if you dont watch out. That is a Truth. And Truth is ancient, and modern too. It just dont ever change. Truth is truth today, yesterday, and tomorrow.
All down through history they've tried to make you think they was your friend, and they'd rape your sister in a minute, or put a knife between your ribs, or lay you down with a gas bomb, or deal you down with a deputy's black-jack ---- and at the same time go ahead equality, something about freedom, something about good jobs at good pay, something about ikd age pensions, and at the same time ..... they know in their hearts that they aim to take all of this away from you the first dam chance they get.
Sara knows here rich men. So did Jesus. The rich men nailed Jesus on a pole in the sky. They nailed Sara's whole family on a pile of coal dust. Here's a belt of bullets, worse than a belt of bullets, from the mouth of Sars Ogan, to riddle the hell out of the old fake story of the rich men at election time,
Get Together. Join up. Shake hands. All you working folks and farmers .... everywhere. That's what Sara's song says. And that's what your own heart says. So ... dam it to hell ... do it!
