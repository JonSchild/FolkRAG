Subject: Phoenix, Arizona, Hospital Project
That the Phoenix, Arizona,Hospital project ($455,000) was
turned down by the Vital Area Board, meeting in SanFrancisco 
on August 3. 
Considerable political pressure and interest in this caused
the rumor to fly, but Vital Area Board did not consider this project.
