is fast at least, and very pleasant, about half the size
of the Austin Elnora.
It seems the Standefer family entire called on
you Sunday afternoon while we were out at Buffalo, and Jimmy 
came by at ten thirty, the same time as I did, Monday
morning expecting to see you then. They all send love, and
are terribly sorry you left when they weren't warned. So
am I.
Shirley's going to add a note. I love you very
much. Come to see us, and do send what[e]ver you hear from
Jo[h]nny.
Dearest love,
Bess
