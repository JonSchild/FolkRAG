Dear Miss Prink:
Under separate cover I am returning the galley proofs
of text and music of John A. Lomax's Cowboy Songs. They
have been extensively corrected, but the printer should
have no difficulty in understanding the nature of the corrections.
He should be particularly on the look-out for
changed single notes (of which there are quite a few). The
marks that I have made upon the text proofs should be as scrupulously
observed as those on the music.
Two general corrections, both of great importance, must
be made, so please see that this portion of this letter gets
into proper hands.
1.  Several of the melodies, not written by me, have
eighth notes printed so:     . Whenever this occurs, the
notes should be printed separately and have a slur over or
under them, so:    .  The melodies needing this correction 
are number 1, 71, 209, 227, 346, 409, 431, 509.
2. An unusually large number of melodies have been printed
with bar lines incorrectly placed at the end of a line of music.
If the bar line is simply removed, it means that an incomplete
measure appears. The measure should be completed before the
next line of music begins. These places absolutely must be
corrected, for they never should have been allowed in the first
place. The melodies showing this defect are numbered 175, 182, 194,
293, 308, 377, 386, 398, 435, 445, 462, 506. This direction takes
precedence of the marks in the proof where I attempted to cross
out bar lines. I found it to be impossible, however.
Assuring you of my continued cooperation, I am
Sincerely yours,
ENW
mr
