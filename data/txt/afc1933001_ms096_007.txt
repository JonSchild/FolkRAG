Dear Mr. Spivacke: Yesterday
I mailed to the Folk Song Archive,
in your care, a statement covering
my activities and expenses in
recording for the Archive 56 1/2
records of songs and interviews
with cattlemen.  Were one as
wise as Solomon and as astute
and resourceful Mercury or
Ganymede I do not believe he
could fill out the blanks fur-
nished me without error. Will
you please have some of your
experts to edit my efforts and
repolish them for my signature;
-over-
