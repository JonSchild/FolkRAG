style. It is conventional European harmony in some ways
but then it departs in certain ways.   Can you just talk a
little bit about that?

[*Melody in each part*]
Buell:    It was the ideal of the composers of the Sacred Harp
that each song have a melody for each part, a counter
melody, second melody, but the melody is there.   The
basic melody is there and then each part elaborates on
that in some way.

AL:    But the parts do unconventional things- there are
parallel fifths and fourths and octaves and sometimes they
cross.

Buell:    Yes, the crossing of voices is one of the most
interesting things for singers, and one of the most difficult
things for the listener to really get into, to be able to
distinguish the purer melody out of those four that are
crossing, but it's much more fun to sing.

AL:    What are the feelings that come out of that unconventional
harmonic aspects, do you think?    You sing it, what does it
do to you?   It does something to a listener which I can't
describe.

Buell:    I can't either.   I think there's a thrilling kind of 
effect with some of what we're talking about- the crossing
of the voices, the fourth and the fifth sounding above the 
tone.
