Mrs. Ruby T. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear Mrs. Lomax:

    Thank you for your two letters and for the return of
the equipment, which arrived in good order. We are taking
care of the packing charges for which you have been billed
by the Dallas Transfer and Terminal Warehouse.

    I am sorry that we had to trouble you at this time, and
would not have done so if we had been fully aware of the
circumstances and the personal inconvenience caused you. I
had heard that Mr. Lomax was ill, and trust that by this time
he is considerably improved.

    He may be interested in the enclosed press release and
feature story regarding the albums. I also enclose a copy
of a letter addressed to him as a result of the release. The
response has been very gratifying, and I thought he would be
pleased to know of the success of the albums, which are the
fruition of his long and devoted association with the Archive.
The five radio scripts written by Alan for Latin American
distribution are being transcribed in Spanish and Portuguese.
I am very busy with the selection and arrangement of records
for the 1943 albums.

    Please let us know how Mr. Lomax is progressing, and
extend him my best wishes and those of all his friends in
the Library.

    With best wishes,
    Yours faithfully,
