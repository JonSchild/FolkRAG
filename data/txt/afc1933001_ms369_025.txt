Grimm was speaking, not of a small group or tribe, but of
some sort of national gathering out of which he imagined such
epics as the Edda and the Ring of the Neibelungs to have arisen. 
Later proponents of the theory of communal original have
modified this statement in two ways. First, the national gathering 
has shrunk to a small tribal dance. Second, the act of
composition has become a leader, chorus affair. (We shall describe
this manner of singing in more detail later.)
The communalists, generally, then, make three assumptions in regard 
to poetry: it originates in the dance; it is the work of a 
group rather than an individual and grows through gradual small
changes and through improvisations; it is epic rather than
lyric in intention. They have based these assumptions on what
they have called the "overwhelming evidence from primitive peoples." 
Gummere, Kittredge, Reed Smith, Ker, and
many others have accepted these theories. Most collecting of
English and American folk-songs has been done on this basis.
For that reason most of the folk-song evidence is rather biased.
Even so Miss Louise Pound, in her "Poetis Origins and the
Ballad" feels free to say deny these three assumptions.
