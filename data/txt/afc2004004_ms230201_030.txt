31.

The man say, "She got to come out there!"
My uncle tell him, "Well, there's one Miz Anne
that's a Negro and she ain't gonna work in the field!"
The white man jumps off his horse and my uncle whupped
him and run him and his horse off the place. (Then
in a weary, quiet voice Natchez finishes his story)
So the white man went to town.  He him him a gang
out there that night.  My uncle shot four or five of them,
but they finally caught him and hung.  So that's the 
story of him.  Yeah!
Sib:  Lynched him.
Natchez:  (With mounting anger) About fifty of sixty of 'em come
out there and got him and killed him.  That was
on account of he was protectin' his own wife! (He
gulps and stumbles)  Because he didn't want his
wife to work out on the farm when she had a new baby
there at the house to care of and she was expectin'
another one pretty soon.  That was the whole
story about that!
The Kid:  Natchez, what did the folks say around there after this
had happened?
Natchez:  You know they didn't like it, but it's a lot of
things you don't like in those places, you dasn't
say anything about. . .Some of them, naturally, would say
he shouldn't talk like he did and then some would say
he was just doin' the right thing, see.
