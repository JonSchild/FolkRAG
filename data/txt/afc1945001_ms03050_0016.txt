Attention:  Mr. William H. Webber
Rumor Report due October 10.

Dear Mr. Webber:

The following residents of Columbia cooperated with us in the rumor
collection completed today and being forwarded to you herewith:

1. W. N. Miner, Secretary of the Columbia Chamber of Commerce.  Mr.
Miner is a very patriotic citizen who, because of a small staff,
is too busy to engage in assignments of this kind frequently.  He
would be glad to cooperate for a day at a time, once or twice a
month if needed.  He believes this work worthwhile.

2.  Henry H. Dorn, proprietor of the Gervais Street Pharmacy.  Mr. Dorn,
whose work in this collection was particularly outstanding, said he
found the work extremely interesting and that he would be glad to
handle this type of assignment as often as they might be desired.

3.  Miss Lou Oswald, beauty instructor in the Carrollete Beauty School.
Miss Oswald instructs about twenty girls who do practice work in the
afternoons.  Most of her customers are of the middle class.  She
will be glad to be of service any time.

4.  Earle R. Britton, past president of the State A. F. of L., and a
member of a local Selective Service board.  Mr. Britton, while an
exceptionally busy man because of his position as mechanical superintendent
of the Columbia Record and because of his activities in
labor circles, said he would be glad to cooperate with us whenever
we felt he could be of service.  He would prefer to engage in this
activity for a day at a time, once or twice a month.

5.  Dr. S. F. Killingsworth, Dentist, 1109 Hampton Street.  Dr. Killingsworth
is active in several fraternal orders and finds that these activities
plus his profession prevent him from undertaking other assignments.
