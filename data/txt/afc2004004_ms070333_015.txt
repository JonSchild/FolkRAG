TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE I.W.O

Dear Brother, 

This will introduce Mr. Alan Lomax, who is
gathering folk songs of the National Groups in America for
the Library of Congress, Division of Music.

He will spend some time in Michigan, Wisconsin
and Minnesota. He is interested in the following National
Groups: Polish, Scandinavian, Finnish and others.

We are confident of the results of his work
in recording and spreading the folk lore of the National
Groups in America. We would appreciate if you can assist
him in reaching key people who could help him carry through
his assignment.

Fraternally yours,
Emanuel Levin
