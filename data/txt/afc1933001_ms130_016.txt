Dear Lomax:
My record for writing letters during the past six
months is certainly a very bad one. I received your
letter in Plaisance the last week in July and intended to
reply before I left the village. However you can imagine
how things piled up on me the last few weeks we were in
the country. I must admit that I did have sometime when
I got back to Port au Prince when I might have written
some letters, but by that time[,] I was pretty well worn
down and too lazy to do anything constructive. I don't
where the time has gone this fall and winter, but I do
know that I haven't accomplished much on my Haitian
material as I hoped to get done by this time. I have
stacks and stacks of notes and if I ever succeed in
getting at putting them together[,] I believe that I shall
have something worth publishing, but I don't expect to
publish a book for at least two years.
I was not surprised to hear that you found you were
pretty sick when you got back to Port au Prince. Fortunately
none of us got malaria or dysentery, but the
children were quite anemic when we got back to Philadelphia.
I didn't travel any in the South and so did not get
to call on the people you suggested in Carrefour Deux
Forts. I thought it would be better for me to stick to
Plaisance and to spend all my time there. Incidentally
Cineas turned out very well as an interpreter.
I appreciated your offer to do anything you could to help with
my work. There wasn't anything that I could think of at
the time that you could have helped me with. I am anxious
to hear some of your records some day. We may come to
Washington soon, and if we do[,] I shall try to get in touch
with you. I have been wondering if it would be possible
for me to get copies of two or three of your best records--
not necessarily those which you made at Plaisance but
records I could use in my classes and elsewhere to give
some idea of Haitian drumming and singing. If there [could] is
[be] any chance to get a few records[,] I should be very
glad to pay for the cost of them and to have you select
them for me. I was glad to hear that your records turned
out so well. I got a great many good still pictures,
some of which I have enlarged and I took five hundred
feet of movie film which is pretty fair.
