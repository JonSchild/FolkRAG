1651 A  (Con't.)

Morton:  On, no.  There's a difference.  A riff is a
background.  A riff is what we call the foundation -- as like
you would walk on something that's standard -- and a break is
something that you break.  When you make a break, that means
all the band break but maybe one, two, or three instruments--
depends upon how the combination is arranged, and as the band
breaks you have a set given time, possibly two bars to
make the break.
Question:   Isn't a break -- when you make breaks, isn't 
that what you mean by swinging?
Morton:   No, no, that's not what swing is.  Swing don't
mean that.  Swing means something like this.   (Piano)
