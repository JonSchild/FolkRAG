RU-RU-RU-RUBEN
Tune: K'K'K'Katy.
Ruben used to be a hayseed green,
Whiskers everywhere he could be seen,
Clod-hopper at day and a green-horn in the night,
Nobody would guess he'd ever fight.
Mortgages have hit him mighty hard,
Interests all his profits soon retard,
Taxes higher yet real relief he cannot get,
Everybody tells him, just forget.

Ruben used to take his grain to town,
The price used to always make him frown,
Now he's wide awake and a shorter way he'll take,
Send it through the Union, make them shake.
Direct buyers used to get his steers and cows,
Buy up all his hogs and all his sows,
Now his head's awhirl and he'll tell the doggone world
They can't buy a pig, not even its curl.

Rueben used to run an open Ford,
Made his backbone feel just like a sword,
Now he sits up straight, drives a packard six or eight,
Gets to church on time--he's never late.
Turns on his fine radio at night,
Jazz noise or a pugilistic fight,
Knows what's going on from the dark until the dawn,
He's as wide awake as Edison.

Rueben used to dress just like a hick,
Town folks used to always get a kick,
Now he slicks up fine, throws away the binder twine,
Dresses fit to kill, he cuts a shine.
White collar and tie about his neck,
Makes town folks look up to him, by heck,
Business man he is, he ought to be, gee whiz!
Feeder of the world, a king he is.

    First chorus.
Ru-Ru-Ru-Ruben ain't no Ruben,
He's a country gentleman--selected lot.
Co-operator, determinator,
Ru-Ru-Ru-Ruben ain't not Ru-Ru-Ru-Ruben sot.

    Second chorus.
Ru-Ru-Ru-Ruben ain't no Ruben,
You can't choke him with the wall street gag no more.
Co-operator, determinator,
Union marketing will open wide his door.
