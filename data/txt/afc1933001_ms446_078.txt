No. 63 

When Jesus Christ was here below, 
He taught his people what to do ; 
And if we would his precepts keep, 
We must descend to washing feet. 

For on that night he was betrayed,
He for us all a pattern laid--
Soon as HIs supper he did eat, 
He rose and washed His brethren's feet. 

The Lord by whom all things were made, 
Arose and by His garments laid ; 
He washed them all, to let them see, 
How equal all of them should be. 

He washed them all, the Scriptures say, 
Yet Judas did his Lord betray ! 
May none of us, like Judas, sell
The Lord for gold, and go to hell. 

Peter said, Lord, it shall not be,
Thou shalt not stoop to washing me-- 
O !  that no Christian here may say, 
I am unwilling to obey. 

You call me Lord, and Master too, 
Then do as I have done to you ; 
All my commands and counsels keep,
And show your love by washing feet. 

Ye shall be happy if you know,
And do these things by faith below ; 
And I'll protect you till you die, 
And then remove you up on high. 

No. 64 

Ye pilgrims that are wandering home-- 
Ye followers of the lamb--
