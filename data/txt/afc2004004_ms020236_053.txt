[*WEST GREEN (J. DEAN & LULU)*]
this man was payin' Laz'rus.   You know.   An' Lazrus had no 
other way to live an' make money.    [Didn't very well] This man was 
payin' Laz'rus, you know.   An' I go where I wanna go.   He figure 
Laz'rus be my bodyguard.   My, that was good!   I wasn't worried 
about it!   See, I jus' liked it like that.  I liked it just like 
she had it; tha's the way I [wa?] always liked it, anyhow.
TL:        What'd you do for him, Bessie?
BJ:        What?
TL:        The night watchman?
BJ:        I didn' do [upt?]nothin' for 'im.
TL:        Nothin'!   He was a doll!
BJ:        Tha's all!  An' if I be gone all the day -- all night 
an' all day Sunday, Miss Alice knew where I was at, ya see?  
Miss Alice knew where I was at.  [I was at] That was puzzlin' them 
again.   They see Laz'rus walkin' around there an' they don' see 
me.   After a while, when they see me, they see me with Laz'rus.  
They didn' know where I come from, ha, ha!
TL:        Everybody thought you were goin' out with that white guy.
BJ:        No.  They couldn't think that because they knew he was 
down home or he would be into places around there.  They would 
jes' see him.

TL:        Also, he would have been bragging.
BJ:        Yeah!  Then hit'd abeen too bad,                   'Cause 
they said, they told [us, said,] me, say, "If he ever say anything to you 
personally, you just turn him off in a nice way, 'cause he hurt 
you."   Say, "If he can't go with you, he sure hurt ya."   So there 
had been a girl lived there named Lulu, an' she -- a colored 
woman -- an' he got up to her the same way, they said.   An' so 
she was goin' ov' to the other mill one day an' he seen her an' 
he got a chance to talk wit' her.   An' she hiked up her dress an'
told him to kiss her backside.    He sot (sic) her clothes on fire, 
[An' started] shootin' at her.
TL:        He did!
BJ:        Yeah!  [So her] Sot clothes on fire shootin' at 'er.  But she 
left there.
TL:        Shot at her?
BJ:        He didn't miss her!  'Cause tha's what they tol' 
me not. . .'cause I said, "He say anything to me, I"m gonna cuss him 
out!"  An' so they say. . .
TL:        What happened to her, Bessie?
