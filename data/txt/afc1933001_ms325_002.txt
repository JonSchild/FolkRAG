Casey Jones was the Rounder's Name

No callous song writer thought up the tragedy
of Casey Jones.  Jones was a real person
and a capable engineer.  This is his story

SIM WEBB put in a little more fire
and then he wiped the perspiration
from his forehead and looked up to
where Casey Jones was sitting with the
throttle in his hand.  Sim Webb was a 
strong, lithe-limbed Negro and the muscles
rippled smoothly under his skin.
He was a mighty proud man—Sim Webb
was.  He was firing on Engine No. 382,
a brand-new locomotive, and he was 
firing for Casey Jones, as capable a man
as ever pushed a train through the night
at seventy miles an hour.

Casey's name was really John Luther
Jones but when he went to work for the
Mobile & Ohio, back in 1882, he found
that there were already three JOhn
Joneses on the road.  He was about 
eighteen then, a big laughing-eyed kid with
strong hands.  (Now, in 1901, he was 
thirty-six.)  The first night he sat down
to dinner with the other brakemen
someone asked him his name.  When he
said John Jones they all laughed.

Bose, Lashley, one of the brakemen 
said, "Kid, where do you come from?"
The kid said, "I come from a place
called Cayce, over in Kentucky."
"Well," Bose said, "we got too many
John Joneses around here now.  From 
now on you're Casey Jones."

Jones grinned amiably and from that
moment on he was Casey Jones.  He became
a fireman on the Mobile & Ohio
and he fired for men like Jim Gaffney
and Bill Ruffin and they called him
Casey.  In 1888, when he went to work
for the Illinois Central, he was known
to every railroad man in that part of the
country as Casey.  But he was Mr.
Jones to Sim Webb.  There was a strong
distinction between firemen and engineers.
All Sim Webb had to do was to
put in more fire when Casey asked for it.
Casey Jones ran the train.  He was 
runnin' it fast now.  They had pulled out
of Memphis an hour and thirty-five
minutes late and already they'd made
up most of that time.

Actually it wasn't Casey's run.  He
and Sim Webb had come into Memphis
after their run from Canton to find that
Joe Lewis, who was scheduled to take
No. 1 south, had reported sick.  They
asked Casey and Sim to "double out"
back to Canton and Casey grinned and
said, "Sure, we can use that extra
money."

Sim nodded happily because he lived
only to get in that cab back of Casey,
feeding Casey's fire.  Yes, they'd left
Memphis an hour and thirty-five 
minutes late.  It was an overcast night and
rain squalls now and then hit Sim in the
face when he stuck his head out the
opening.  No. 382 was steaming well, as
railroad men say, and Casey opened 
that throttle.  By the time he roared 
through Sardis, Miss., he'd picked up
thirty-five minutes.  When he reached
Grenada, he was only half an hour
behind schedule.

Now he headed for the next station.
Vaughan, Miss.  Just beyond Vaughan
was the town of Canton where Casey's
run ended, and Casey had a surprise for
Canton.  Sim Webb, thinking about it,
grinned.  He had a new whistle, too.
Engineers then had individual whistles,
they weren't standardized as they are
now.  Casey's new one had a peculiar
high screech to it.  Trainmen, working
on the tracks, telegraph operators—they 
could all tell who was handling an 
incoming train just by the sound of the
whistle.  Sim Webb looked up when
Casey Jones called to him.

Casey turned a smiling face to him
and said, "Sim, wait till they hear that
new whistle we put on at Memphis."
"That'll wake 'em up, Mistah Jones,"
Sim Webb said.
"It's a nice whistle," Casey said, and
then stuck his head out of the opening
to look ahead.

They roared through Pickens, seven
miles north of Vaughan, and Casey
