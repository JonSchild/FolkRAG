Dear Sir
Was so glad to read your editorial taken from
The Fort Worth Star Telegram.  it was the best
writeup that "Our Song" has ever had and I
am so glad it has been published so everyone
can read and I do hope it has convinced
everyone (without a question) even your friends
down in Texas that it was written about our 
own Smith County and of the plains of Kansas
it was my own dear Father the late Cal Harlan who
used to love to sing the song. (always to him known
as My Western Home and he always sang it to the
older tune not quite so modern as it is now.
I think you wrote to our aunt Mrs. Virgie D. Borr in
San Francisco, Calif.  she is the only one of our family
left that knows the back history of it all,  all though
the Harlan children know some of the History.  it
isn't like 75 or 80 years ago and the ones
that knew and saw. This writer of this song
and Uncle Dan Kelly who wrote the music to it.
Just one of Dan Kelly's boys are alive (he had four boys)
