Fisk, 10. 7.

Stewball.
Will Stark.

Oh, Stewball, Oh, Stewball --
I know him of old;
You runnin in London
Twelve long years ago.

When the word was given,
The horsesto go,
Stewball, he started
Like an arrow
From the bow.

On the day that was 'pointed
For the horses to run,
The ladies and gentlemen
From Baltimore come.

Th  ladies did holler,
And the gentlemen did squall.
The children cried,
"Look, look,
At noble Stewball."

Old Bonnie's a fine horse,
Had a long tail and mane.
Stewball come pass um
Like the shot over the rain.

Stick fast to your saddle;
Say, ride, don't fall.
You won't be jockeyed
By noble Stewball.

Old Master, Old Mater,
I'm risking my life
to win all this money
For you and your wife.

Master bet hundred
And Missus bet pounds.
He was winner
But Mister took down.

A: Go on[e].  There's something about a [b]girl.
S: I don't know that part.
A: How does it end?
S: I couldn't tell you.  There's so much to it.
A: Who sang that?
S: My father, James Stark.
