Boll Weevil-2

"Ill be back next spring,
When you spadin up your land."

That farmer s' to the boll weevil,
"How come yo head so red?"
"Eatin all the farmer's coton,
But he tryin to kill me dead."

The farmer went to the merchant
For to get his wife a dress,
Boll weevil says, "Now farmer,
I sho got you best."

Rhen the farmerwent to the merchant then,
For some dippin and chewin
Boll weevil say, "Now farmer,
Ain' nothin doin."
                You cain't have a dime,

The farmer went to the merchant then,
    Gonna git him a bucket of lard,
"Cain't get nothin', farmer,
The Boll got yo job."

Well, the farmer went in the field next mornin
Boll weevil flyin in the air,
Went out there next evenin
Done moved his fam'ly there.

The farmer ax the boll weevil,
"What int he worl you tryin to do?
I'm tryin' to carry six rows,
And my chillun all carryin two."

         That was made along [up] a little further up than the others.
I just kept a-hearin bougt um talkin bout boll weevils
and I'ze makin up songs in them days and I just went on out on it.
Boll weevil eatin up all the cotton those days. I got that un
by myself. 
           A: You didn't hear and other song?
           H: Nawsuh, I hadn' never heered nary un atall. It may have
been out, but I hadn't never heered it at all.
