They live on the Cumberland plateau -
little erosion - but soil is thin - much
helped by TVA phosphate recently - diversified 
farmers corn, cotton, tobacco,
soy beans, cane, etc.. They are

of the Baptists that split off in
1830 from the Baptists who participated

missionary activity & they tend to 
be pre-destinarian. The sect still
sings the hymns which were radical departures
in 1790. Declining, 
of course
