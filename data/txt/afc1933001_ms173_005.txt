Dear Mr. Lomax,

 I hope to be in Washington this
Thursday.  If so, will certainly drop by to see
you.  In case I dont, I want you to know that
there is all day  meeting at the church I told
you of, this next Sunday, which is the 10th, I
think.  The grand Reverand I want you to get,
will preach there.  I shall ask him to sing
God amighty's Army is a praying little army;
The old world is moving at the Lord's command;
and other fine hymns he knows.  I do hope you
can come down.  Could you drop me a line so I
can tell the Rev?  I hate to mention it to him
again unless I am sure, as I have told him so
many times, that I thot we would be up there
with you, then I dont go thru with it.
Services are supposed to be at eleven a.m.,
but seldom get under way till noon.

 Please try to come.  I know you will get
something good.

You come on the Fredericksburg road; turn
right at Aquia church.  The garage can direct
you.  After turning right, you drive about 1/2 mile
till you come to a big old house, at the top of
the hill in a grove of oaks (right hand side)
This will be my Father's place.  His name is
T. J. Waller.

 I believe these directions are easily followed.
 Hoping to see, or hear from you, I am
 Very sincerely yours,
   Mary Waller Bonelli
