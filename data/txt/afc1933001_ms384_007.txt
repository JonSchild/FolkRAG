For they took not the wings of the morning.
I hear the righteous shouting
For they took the wings of the morning.

I'll praise him while he gives me breath,
I hope to praise him after death.

Heaven:
Over Jordan, where pleasures never die;
Where the wicked cease from troubling
And the weary are as rest.
----
Train to heaven:
The fare is cheap and all can go. No rich &
poor are there. No second class on board
this train, no difference in the face.
