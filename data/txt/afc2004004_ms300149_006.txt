Dear Allan:
Sorry the delay in answering your letter but ,  am in
contact with King Records.  Am waiting  to see what agreement
they'd offer me.  Have been offered a contract on Albums.  
But would like some single records with the album, if 
possible. 
Maybe you could get me a better contract than with King. 
Would like to hear by return mail before i sign with
King. 
Would like to get them out soon as possible. 
Am still looking for my Folk Song Book. 
With best wishes

Yours truly, 
Wade Mainer
