Englis 6

Mr. and Mrs. Jones were blessed with a
baby boy.  But when the time came
to give the baby a name, no one
seemed to be able to find one for him.
Neighbors--What have you decided
                     to name your son, Mr. & 
                     Mrs.  Jones?
Father--"Weatherstrip" (smiling from
                ear to ear)
Neighbors--But why would you want
                      to name him "Weatherstrip?"
Father--Because he's going to keep me
              out of the "draft."
