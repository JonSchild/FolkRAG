Dear Bill:

Enclosed is a list of songs for clearance for the
Spiritual Program. I have this day received confirmation
of the invitation extended to me by the White House for the
folksong party on the 17th. I have written Willie Johnson,
Burl Ives and Joshua White and they will also get invitations
from the White House. But just to be sure that they
receive the word, I'd appreciate your speaking to each one
of them for me.

I don't have much money to spend so I have to arrange
for the Gate to take the pullman down after their show and
the other two to take the day coach down early Sunday morning.
They will have their expenses paid, all of them, for
Sunday and Monday, but C.B.S. will have to take care of the 
Gate's expenses for Tuesday when they give the show with me.
Do you wish me to have the scripts down down horn or up at
your place? and who's going to direct the Tuesday's show?
I imagine our rehearsal will have to come sometime Monday
morning early.  I hope that you've found out that Burl has
been pretty hard to handle on Back Where I Come From.  He's
a nice fellow but convinced of the fact that he's the best
singer in the world.  He can make Back Where I Come From impossible
by refusing to take direction and you can make it
possible by making him feel that he does not have to.

Much love,

Alan
