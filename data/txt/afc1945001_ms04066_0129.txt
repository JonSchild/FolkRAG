Newark, N. J., August 4, 1942

"Several days ago the Coast Guard Patrol near Baltimore detected 5
German saboteur suspects attempting to land in a rubber boat.  Boat
was destroyed by gun-fire; 3 of the suspects killed, the other 2 apprehended.
It is said that if the pending Supreme Court action in
the trial of the first saboteurs arrested results in their favor,
that the 2 surviving suspects 'will be shot attempting to escape'."  [*10*]
