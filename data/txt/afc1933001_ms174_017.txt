Mr. Alan Lomax

September 13, 1941
Attached is your breakdown for the proposed expedition to
Livingston, Alabama.  Will you please revise your justification and
items of expenditure in accordance with our recent conversation?  I
suggest that such things as needles, express, machine costs, etc. be
lumped together under one heading - miscellaneous.
