BJ TAPE 15, p. 49

     An' ah, an' ah, an' I told Mama ta, ta sen' her down
there, you, you know, where I was, ta stay with' me awhile ta
go to school down there.  An' so, Mama said she would.  An'
when I got the l-letter -- Ya see, ya see, Mama can't write.  She
had some of 'em to write for 'er.  I got the letter Sattiday
mornin'.  An' the letter said Rosalie'd be there Saturday.
AL:  Thursday?
BJ:  Sattiday.  See?  An' I got it Sattiday mornin'.  I guess she
thought it -- an' so -- but some of 'em tried ta tell me, said,
"She didn't meant today," ah, said, said, "She didn't say it today."
You, you know, Saturday this week.  Say, "She mean next Sat'day."
But sumpin' tells me in my mind she meant today.  I jus' kep'
on with it.  I jus' got upset.  I was way out in the country;
I was -- oh, no, I wasn'. . .3 miles out from town.  An' -- out
the Harbranch (?) place.  An' I put my piece an' rode, an' went
on over to 'im.  An' when I got there, I went on down to the
depot. The train done gone.  Wa'n' nobody in there.  I asked
the depot man about it.
     He says. "Yes," says, "A lil' girl in here.  She stood
around here a long time waitin' on somebody to come an' get
'er."  Said, "But hit a lady come an' got 'er an' they went across
that railroad track."  An' so an' the way, an' the way he 'scribed
'er, I said, "That's her."  I said, "I know that's her."  In
my mind, I just felt it, ya know?  I had a funny feelin'.
     Well, anyhow, I was so tired, I didn't know what to do.  I
walked every step a the way; looked there wasn't nowhere for me.
I went over that place.  An' I went over 'cross the railroad
tracks; I didn't know where to look; I didn't know what to do.
