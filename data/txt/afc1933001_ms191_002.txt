Mr. Alan Lomax
242 East 19th Street
New York City

Dear Alan:

We have just received a wire from "Pappie From Nassau" saying:

"Come and see me at Hebron Labor Camp Maryland before I go moving somewhere by Saturday. Yours Pappie From Nassau."

I am writing him to keep in touch with us and may be it will be possible for him to come to the Library, perhaps to be recorded.

I listened to your broadcast Sunday with Herbert Halpert who is stationed in Washington until the 1st of August, and is staying with me. I thought it the best so far and Herbert's commit was:  "I could never get up a program like that in two weeks."

With best wishes,

Faithfully,
