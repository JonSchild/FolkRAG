Mr. John A. Lomax
8170 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

    I am very pleased to learn that you recorded Dick
Devall. I shall communicate with our Acquisitions Depart-
ment and ask them to arrange for payment. I am very
anxious to hear the records.

    I have just received your letter of November 21, in
which you request a recording machine. I should be very
happy to send you one were it not for the fact that there
isn't a single portable machine around the place. In fact,
I just had a similar request from Alan. All our machines
are out but you may rest assured that as soon as they come
back, we shall give very serious consideration to your
suggestion that we place one in Dallas.

    With kindest regards,

    Sincerely yours,

    Harold Spivacke
    Chief, Music Division
