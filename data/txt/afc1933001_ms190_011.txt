Mr. Willis Lawrence James

Dear Mr. James:
   I have just written a long letter to William Haygood
of Rosenwald Foundation, suggesting three fellowships and yours
is one of the names included.  I sent him copies of excerpts of
your letters to me giving your record and your interest in
collecting wartime folklore.  I have high hopes that something
will come of this application.
   The wartime Negro songs and stories that you are
apparently gathering on your own initiative would be of great
use to this office and I would be very greatly interested to
see them as soon as you could send me copies.  In the first
place, they will provide interesting material for our survey
of Negro folk opinion about the war, and second, some of them
may be actually useful for wide distribution over the radio, etc.
One way you will make your contribution to the war effort,
whether or not these fellowship plans go through, is by continuing
to work with my division as a correspondent on Negro wartime
folklore.  Let me know what you think about this and send
me the songs as soon as you can.

With best wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Division of Educational Services
