BJ:     They got them out'.   An' one of the mens is now on they place -- 
One of 'em came down [here do] to he'p 'em move with.  They tol' 
me that wa' one of 'em but not to say anything about it, but
that was one of the mens.   Big, stout, heavy, dark-skin, colored 
man.   Strong as I don' know what.   Yessir.   He come, come down 
to he'p move them.   'Cause I was with 'em.   I hope (helped) [to]
[move up] clean up everything ['cause I] to move, you know, these 
people here, what, what [I] was tellin' [ya] me about it.  They moved back ta Carolina?   They had bought a house on the Island, in there.  So she 
decided to go back.  She was a schoolteacher.  An' so they 'cided to 
go back to Carolina, 'cause they got a motor coat, coach 
place over there, on' the other side a. . .
AL:     They've got a what?
BJ:      These people.  So they went back.  But one of the same 
men that ho-- come hope (helped) move them, man, was one of 
the men they had got off that place.   An' they told me about it.  
An', oh, they was crazy about him!  They was crazy about him. 
They said anything in this world you trusted to him?   Everything, 
that man will do.  They -- He killed their hawgs, he'll 
farm, anything.   You know, I mean, they ain't got to worry about 
nothin'.   Jus' say it's, ah, taken care of, you know.   Jus', meat 
is taken care of.   The hams she brought down there, say he the one 
that cured 'em.   Jus' do any-- jus', jus' good peoples.   Just 
was treated like beastes, that was all.
          Anyways, they, they out from down there now, but there two 
families, say they can't git them out to save they life.
AL:      Why can't he get them out of there?
BJ:       They just won't go.  They just won't go.
AL:      Why do you think they won't go?
