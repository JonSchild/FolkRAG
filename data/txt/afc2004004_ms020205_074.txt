Reverend Roe - Reel 2 - P. 1

(First Sermon)
R:  I began-- well, I asked for license to preach and they wouldn't allow me to
speak in the church but there was a woman, very sick, and she wanted to hear
service. They sent me out there, and one of the deacons carried me. I rode
a mule bareback. I went out and there was a few people around her. So I had
a song and prayer. The old deacon prayed, I don't remember the verse, and I
haken for my text, I think, it's the second chapter of James -- "If there is
any sick among you, call for the elders of the church. Let them pray for
you, anointing you with oil, and the prayers of faith shall save the sick."
I spoke from that text; I don't remember anything I said, it seemed like
something else had holt to me, but when I kinda come to myself, I just
talked. The people was all shedding tears all around me, and I couldn't say
what I had done. The old deacon then got ready and we went back, and he told
them that I preached just about as fine a sermon as he'd want to hear. And
then they had me to preach it in the church. So men came in to make fun --
it was in the Territory, Indian Territory, and the people was awful wild up
there -- they taken seat in front of the pulpit -- "We're gonna have some fun
out of him." And I taken one of them in the church that night.
A:  These were some white men or were these all colored?
(Best preacher)
R:  Oh those, they were colored, Indian, half Indian Well, then they tried to
call me to that church but I wouldn't accept it because the man that was
pastoring, you know, he license me to preach and I wouldn't accept the
church. Then I returned back home because I was said to be the best preacher
up in that part of the country and I knew that was no place for me. I had
to be where there was something for me to reach up after. I come on back to
Texas but let me tell you this story. . .
There was something happened just before I left there that I have never been
able to understand. Now you have to make a monthly report -- the teachers
did, you know, there -- and my wife had been teaching and I assisted her in
