Q.  When did the hot stuff come?
2487A
M.  Well, the hot stuff came in 1902 - - Well, they came in after 1903.
They came in immediately after 1902 that the hot idea was arranged.
Of course, they had another hot style before - was - uh would say what 
you call rag time - the kind that you start to playing at a certain
tempo, then you increase and you increase and you increase.  You don't 
do deliberately, but you increase due to the fact that there wasn't a 
perfect tempo set for that kind of a music.
Q.  The tunes that you'd play in those bands - how would they go now?
M.  Well, for an instance, they'd go like this.  National Anthem, see here's
the way they'd start.  Drums (imitates), the trumpet would pickit up -
they'd be goin right along - (continues to imitate and describe a band.)
(The next strain has doubling of notes and breaks.) (He goes out in
rising cadence.)
     You see they'd be goin out then, see.  Sometimes they'd start
goin out a half a strain.  I'm tellin' you it would be terrible hot and 
everybody - the kids'd be jumping up and the boys, like the drummer he'd
be throwing his sticks up in the air and catching up, throwing on the ground,
bouncing them up as he walks and catching and he better not miss because
the whole bunch would razz him.  The bass drum player, he's have his bass
drum beaten, just twirling it around in the air.  And the boys, usually,
that played trombone - I used to do it, myself - if they had a slur, they'd
make these slurs (An - a, -da-dum-da)
You couldn't keep up with the music.  You'd stop while the slur would
be goin on and catch up later.  You'd shove one foot out there and
stop while the slur's going on - (am - am) and then walls.
     An, it was tremendous and everybody would raise a lotta sand
and everybody seemed to like it very much.
Q. - ? - National Anthem?
M.  Lemme see now the national anthem go.  I've forgotten how that goes now.
