just had to lay over. . .old Mother Jones, shook her fists
and said sons of bitches, one of these days Uncle Sam'll
be glad to have the unions.
AL:  She was right of course, because the unions finally did
win.
Nimrod:  Yeah, she stuck her first right up their nose, buddy.
She fought to the last minute. And we would have won then,
and had the union, if Uncle Sam hadn't sen[t] soldiers in--
a standing army, you can't pass the army.  There ain't no
union. . . .could fight Uncle Sam's army, cause they got all
the material, all the guns and everyting else.  They've got
it all. . . . . . .Yessir, I been through some great things,
danger too.  I wouldn't want to have to do it again.  And
I wouldn't wat to see it back like it was then, the children
and the people growing up. . . . .
AL:  The union really brought i[n] a lot of good things for
the people.
Nimrod:  Brought it all.  You could put i[n] a bag and

all up.  So he's in behind bars, and the last time I seen
him. . . . . . .he was as poor as a katydid(?) and I wasn't a bit
sorry for him.  I held his hand over there, I held his 
hand and he promised me he'd see that I got my pension, but
I knew he wouldn't do it.  And he threatened John. . . .right
