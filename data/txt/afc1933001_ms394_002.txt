ADVENTURES OF A BALLAD HUNTER

PREFACE

One for the blackbird, one for the crow,
One for the cutworm and two to grow.

Years ago I used to chant this rhyme as I dropped corn into the freshly
turned furrow while I followed close behind a plow that ripped a trench
in the warm earth. Even in early morning the fresh, soft, moist loam felt cheering
and friendly to my bare feet. One ploughboy and team opened a furrow,
another ploughboy and team followed to cover up the [furrow] corn, while I,
younger and smaller than the other field hands, walking between the two plows,
dropped the seed-corn close behind the scooter that opened the land. A tin
bucket full of seed-corn, held with my left hand, swung on one side. With my
free right hand I would reach for a handful of seed-corn from the bucket,
and, as I walked down the furrow, I would let the grains slip, a steady trickle 
of color, through my fingers (* my fingers grew very skillful) one and one,
and one and two: two kernals for the fowls of the air, one for a burrowing
worm, two to provide wagon loads of corn for our log crib. Backward and forward
across the broad field went this group, -- two teams, tow ploughs, tow drivers and one singing barefoot boy-

Whistle and hoe,
Sing as you go;
Shorten the rows
By the songs you know.

All through the day, though my hands grew tired (I plunged them into the cool,
[drying] shiny grains when we stopped for a moment at the turn-row), and my feet grew
heavy. [but] I would bolster my courage with jingles, chanting the old rhymes;
for long before sundown a six year old boy drooped [in] from weariness. Scattered
over the field were flocks of blackbirds and crows, scratching busily after
their share of the seed, while Brother Cutworm he "lay low", waiting for the 
corn to sprout, for a tender shoot to push upward, on which he could feast.
