Time Code:        Tape:  33   R. Hicks & Friends

    SH:   Yeah.
    FP:    She was a Foster, I think she's Laura's first cousin?
    SH:   Yeah, that's what we heared as kids growin' up--
    FP:    She had a couple of young 'uns, too.
    Fr:    And both of the women had put, uh, blame on him for bein'
pregnant.
    SH:   Yeah, yeah, both of 'em put it. . .          Tom Dooley.
    Fr:    Yeah, and--
    SH:   That's what my grandma said.
    Fr:    They all, uh--
    Fr:    They both couldn't, both . . .
    Fr:    No, they both wanted him.
    FP:   That's what I said a while ago, they both . . . to frame
the man.
    Fr:    And he was really framed, and . . . 
    F :    That feller's in a heap of trouble.
    Fr:    you see, the way I always heared it, Laura Foster killed--
    EP:    . . .
    SH:   He was framed, the way it was the man was framed.
    Fr:    He was framed, the women framed him.
    FP:   I don't think none of 'em. . .  had the morals of a alley
cat, though.  Very little morals in any of 'em, restraint in any of
the things . . . 
    Fr:     . . .
    Fr:     . . .  there's different stories of it, you know.
    Fr:     . . . hear your story, Ray.
    RH:   Huh?
