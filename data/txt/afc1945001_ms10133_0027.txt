(1) That Ain't It.
A soldier walked around camp and people or officials thought he was crazy.
Everything he came to he would say, "That ain't it". So finally the 
officers decided to discharge him. When he went into the office
and started saying, that ain't it, they new then he was crazy.
They handed him his discharge papers and he hollered "That's
It." He was put back in the army.
(2) The Blind Soldier
There was a blind soldier who came to take his final examination.
The doctor placed cards before him and he couldn't see a thing.
So finally the doctor asked the nurse to walk pass with out her
dress on. The soldier didn't budge or fudge. He asked her to remove
her clothes down further. Still nothing happened. Finally she walked
in naked. The doctor said maybe you can't see anything brother, but
your indication is pointing straight to Fort Knox. Next please.
3. Toast to Hitler!
Here's to Hitler as powerful as he is,
And here's to Uncle Sam as powerful as he is
But as powerful as Hitler is & as powerful as Uncle Sam is
Hitler isn't as powerful as Uncle Sam is, as powerful as he is.
4. Nazi dogs read & run.
If you can't read run away.
1. Get out of the U. S.
2. Take all your treasonous ways with you.
3. You serve your own God & go to hell & we'll
serve our God above and live well
and happy.
