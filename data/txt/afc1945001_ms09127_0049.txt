there are rumors that we will
have a ration on money, just so much
for clothes, for food, for bills and for
recreation, another rumor is that
Hitler is sick and I heard Hitler
was dead, and another rumors 
I heard was that the war will 
be over by 1941[4?] and after
the war, & we win, England will
 turn against us.
