Dear Dr. Spivacke,

The tale of my disasters in the past few days is almost epic, indeed, 
if I were a voodooist, I should certainly now be consulting a doctor and 
he would be bathing me in some decotion or other.
1) Monday night I stayed late in Dalray, the Hungarian section recording 
Hungarian songs and after two o'clock, when the singers were tired 
and I had packed the machine in the car, they asked me in for a glass of 
something cool and we chatted until three. The next afternoon in another 
part of the city, I unpacked the equipment to record Serbian gusla music 
only to discover that the acetate cutting head had disappeared from the place 
I had left it beside the recording machine on the back seat. I went back to 
the house hoping that I had by some crazy chance dropped it there. (I am 
staying at a private home on 16th street.) Then I drove out to Delray and 
looked up the people who had helped me load the equipment the night before. 
They confirmed my opinion that the machine had been completely loaded and 
the car locked before I had gone back upstairs for the chat. There was one 
fellow  on whom the finger of suspicion rested, though very lightly, but 
he had nothing to offer that was helpful.
2)By this time it was nearly eight o'clock, at which time I had an 
engagement to record Negro spirituals in a tent church across town. I rushed 
there and  after attempting to use my aluminum cutter with little success 
I set out about 11:30 for a cruise through the Negro section with a [very] 
intelligent Negro [h] man I had[ve] met. [This man is a Writers Project worker, and completely Reliable]  We had scarcely driven around the corner 
when we heard a guitar  singing the blues, stopped the car, and went 
back to discover one of the finest Negro informants I have ever encountered. 
We listened to him for a half an hour and went back to the car. There were 
a couple of [l] other stops in the Begro settlement before I drove home about 
two o'clock. The next morning when I [wnet] went out to the car , the machine [wa] 
was gone along with my  guitar. For some reason no records, no film had
been stolen. The camera was still where I had left it.
I called a squad car at once and they took the report and later on 
I went down to the local FBI office and put the matter in the hands of the 
G-men. From that place I wired [q]you and Presto-- this last to get for the 
police the serial number on the equipment. Then in the afternoon I called 
on the Negro lieutenant who knows his district better than anyone and made 
a special appeal to him to locate the stolen goods if he could. He promised 
to work on the case.
[3x] The theft of the cutting head seemed so inexplicable [tk] and [an] the 
attempt to locate it so hopeless that I had decided, so far as I had decided 
anything in the rush of events, to buy a new one out of my own pocket.
I have just received my first report from the police and from the 
FBI. So far they have found nothing at all and they are not very encouraging. 
Although they feel sure that it will turn up eventually, they say it may be within a week or within six months. They suggest I hang around for 10 days, anyway. My present plans,
