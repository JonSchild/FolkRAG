Mr. Earl C. Reed  -2-  August 27, 1937

I should greatly appreciate a letter from you giving me whatever
information you can in regard to the music of your county and
I should like to know at the same time whether or not you think you
could help me, or would be interested in doing so, when I visit 
your county this fall with the Library's recording machine.

I leave Washington for Kentucky on September the first and I 
hope to hear from you before that time. If it happens that your
letter reaches the Library after September first, it will be forwarded 
to me in Kentucky.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk-Song


Compliance with the above request will be a service to the 
Library of Congress, and appreciated.
