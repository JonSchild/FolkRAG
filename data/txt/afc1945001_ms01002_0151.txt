to the public.  The success of the project depends largely upon the 
skills of these people, and the confidence they inspire.

Workers in the project should make themselves expert in the 
fundamentals and practice of critical thinking.  They should be given
special training in the psychology of cognitive activities and regular
review sessions; in the application of such knowledge.  Rumors must
not be passed in an office directed to their elimination.  Conversations
among workers cooperating on this project, outside of the project
office, should never include any rumors.  Anywhere there is any opportunity
for being overheard, project workers should be especially careful
that they do not say anything with might spread rumors further.

All material dealt with by a local rumor control project
is to be considered "confidential" in the strict sense of the term.
Material should be released only through the project director, or as
specifically directed by him.  It should be recognized that rumors
are choice conversation pieces and give an individual an opportunity 
to show he is on the "inside" and knows many things that others do not
know.  He should be especially careful to avoid using his position in
the project in this unwarranted fashion.

The Office of War Information has been dealing with rumors
on a national scale continuously.  If local projects need help with
[local rumor] rumor control the OWI is in a position to provide aid.  Where the
need for guidance or aid is felt by any established local rumor control
project, the project director should communicate with the Bureau of
Intelligence, Office of War Information, Washington, D. C.
