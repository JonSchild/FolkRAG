Dear Mr. Lomax:

Re:  TALL TALES

   It is about ten days now that we received the
"introduction," but we have not yet received the other data
you promised.  Please, please, send it on.

   The introduction is very good.  We'll use it on
the screen in type until such time as we can complete arrangements
to film you talking it.  Will let you know and give you
ample time.

   Please rush the other data!

Sincerely yours,

BRANDON FILMS, INC.
