GARY:
on the side of the railroad. We got on that lumber you
understand on one side of it put down our coats on our heads
and laid down to go to sleep. The other fella slept but
I couldn't sleep. So I decided to play some guitar you know
after we started walking the next day. Got to another station
asked some colored people there who were working on the
railroad. I got to playing my guitar, they stopped to listen, Come
A big old red faced man says What the god-damn hell you standing
around listening for, get them picks on up or I'll stone the
hell out of you. You oughta see them grab those picks. This
fella comes crying "Oh Lord I wished I died from all these
labors" I wanted to cry but I didn't cry I just took right on out
of there. We get where a well is and we get thirsty, run across
a can, and didn't know what was in the can, then you know
whats in this stick, we took our knives and punched holes in it
and some twine and let that can down in that well and thats
the way we take our water and sometime we go to a store and get
a shortcake, you know what a shortcake is? A loaf of bread. That
what you call a shortcake. We grabbed that loaf of bread and
tear half in two. I'd eat that with them [willing] you understand, they didn't
know what money I had you understand. So while they were trying
to find a place commission for us to play you understand, I'd
be sitting around trying to make me some change you understand
package it right down in my pocket.
LARRY:
Rev. Davis, at that time were dances hard to play for or hard
to find.
