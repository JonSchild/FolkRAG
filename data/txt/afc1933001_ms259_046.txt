Your Protection is Our Concern
Nothing is more conducive to happiness than health
and a sense of security.  It is our sincere wish that you
have both.  Perhaps you haven't been sick for years and
feel that you won't for many more.  Perhaps you
feel you won't need hospital care at all.
But--do you know that today over two thousand five
hundred people are receiving care in our Washington
hospitals?  Most of them, a month ago, had no more
thought of going there than you have right now.

What Are Your Chances?
Last year more than one out of every ten in Washington
sought and received hospital care.  We hope
that neither you nor any member of your family will
be the one of the ten who may need it this year, but if
you should be, we hope group hospitalization will have
been able to make things easy for you.
Sickness is bad enough at best, but it becomes increasingly
worse when it is complicated by worries of
meeting hospital costs; and hospital bills, by the way,
are a large part of the cost of the care of serious
sickness.

Save These Worries
The Hospital Service Plan, as described in this leaflet,
makes it possible for employed persons to meet their
hospital expenses and those of their families with ease,
and thus rids sickness of one of its chief worries.
