[*[*]Ah, Doodles took us to ah - ah, a kind of a 
backwoods hunting party, where a man has a
field that he keeps for his rabbits. Never
permits a rabbit to be killed. Has a bunch of
rather sedate beagles that he and his friends
get together, and they let the beagles out 
and the beagles ah, um, drive the rabbits out
of the clover, and the alfalfa, and they see
the rabbits but ah, no rabbit ever dies.
[LAUGHS] And they sit there and lie about their
dogs. And ah tell about ah all sorts - tell
the tall tales that Americans like to tell
when they're hunting, like ah: Mmm, the dog
that was so smart that it would - could read,
and one time they ah - this old dog was
standing on the street , pointing at a sign
and they looked across the street and the
sign said: A. Papridge, Attorney-at-Law.[*]*]

Ah, they ah, these are old-timers recalling
like good ah, good traditionalists that their
ancestors have always been, ca - recalling old
days, talking about the funny and interesting 
words and languages their parents had used,
recalling the songs of their -  ah, of, of, of
the old times.
