Miss Olive W. Dennis
710 Walnut Avenue
Baltimore, Maryland

Dear Miss Dennis:

I have just had word from Professor H. M.
Belden, to whom I wrote concerning your request,
that he is totally unfamiliar with the song,
"Thatcher Perkins was the builder of the 49".
He suggests that Mr. Carl Sandburg might be
able to help you locate the song. He can best
be reached through his publishers, Harcourt,
Brace & Company, New York.

Should I, at any time, run across any
information concerning this song, please be assured
that I shall do my best to communicate it
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Honorary Consultant and Curator
