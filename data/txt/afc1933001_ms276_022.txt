a) A record of Santy Anna, made by an English shantyman.

SANTY ANNA

We're sailing down the river from Liverpool;
Heave away, Santy Ann-o,
Around Cape Horn to Frisco Bay,
All on the plains of Mexico.

Chorus:
So heave her up and away we'll go,
Heave away, Santy Ann-o,
Heave her up and away we'll go,
All on the plains of Mexico.

She's a fast clipper ship, and a bully good crew;
Heave away, Santy Ann-o,
A down-east Yankee for her captain too;
All on the plains of Mexico.

There's plenty o' gold, so I've been told;
Heave away, Santy Ann-o,
There's plenty o'gold, so I've been told,
Way out West to Californio.

Back in the days of Forty-nine;
Heave away, Santy Ann-o,
Those were the days of the good old times,
All on the plains of Mexico.

b) Listen to the complexities of "The Bay of Mexico" as it is performed by a
group of Negro dock laborers in Nassau who never saw the inside of a book. 

THE BAY OF MEXICO

Chorus:
Round dat bay of Mexico,
Aye, Suziano,
Mexico is de place I belong in,
Round dat bay of Mexico.

Oh, why dose yellow gals love me so?
O Suziano,
'Cause they know I don't told ev'ything I know,
Round de bay of Mexico.

And when I was a young man in my time,
Aye Suziano,
Oh, I knock dose young gals two at a time,
Round de bay of Mexico.

Dose Nassau gals ain't got no comb,
Aye, Suziano,
Oh, dey comb dey head wid a whipper back-bone;
Round de bay of Mexico.
