Harry Cox. December 2, 1953. Lomax flat, London.
Lomax: You say, Harry, that they never sent you children away 
from home when the babies came.
Cox: No, never sent 'em away, nobody. There was nowhere to send
'em to. You had to keep 'em there. If you had a house, well, 
they still stopped there. We never got sent away. But I don't 
never remember about bein' - well, we weren't - some of 'em were 
old enough - I mean, I didn't - I were not old enough to - to 
know about that so much then, you see. I remember two of 'em bein' 
born.   I knew they come - there wasn't half I didn't know; not 
then. I mean I didn't know how they come. They - they used to 
tell us they dug 'em up out of the gooseberry bush. Well, o'
course, I didn't know any difference much until I got older.
Lomax: How old was it before you understood where they babies 
came from?
Cox: I - well, I think I knew -- I heard all the time about sex. 
I'd - I'd heard some funny language and one thing and another, 
I went about in the pubs, along with my father. Sometimes he 
didn't really want to have me there, I know. I mean, when you're 
along the bar there, there's all sorts of things come out, 
sometime. I didn't care. I soon got so I understood that.
Lomax: But your other brothers and sisters didn't understand so 
young?
Cox: No, my other brother - I got another brother at 
there, he's four year younger than me, course, he didn't 
know nothin' about that at all. He weren't old enough to know 
about any o' it.
Lomax: But you found out from the pubs?
