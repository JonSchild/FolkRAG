7) As I was gaeing to the market, laddie, my pension for to fee,
I met a bonnie wee lassie and the kilt between her knee.
8) She give to me some sweeties, I offered her a kiss.
I says "My bonnie wee lassie, will you take a pull at this?"

Davy: . . . . .not healthy for you to be indoors summertime. I like
to go way out.
Shirley: Do you still go out?
Davy: Aye, but I don't go camping now. I stopped that years ago.
To go camping on the road now, go to camps, put the sticks down,
get the cover for the camp up, and when you've put a camp up
you've got to watch very carefully that the ground is trod under
your feet. Not into a hollow, and not too flat. Not too soft
ground. Always look for a hard rise. Not too much of a rise. Put
your camp on a fine hard piece of ground. If the ground is too
hard, a traveller or gipsy or tinker lays an iron bar - what we
call a jockey - it's about 3 to 4 feet and it's turned at the head
like a hoop. So you push it in the ground when the fires going.
If the ground's too hard it canna sink in the ground. You bore
holes for this iron jockey, four at each side, place your sticks
in each side. What we call a ridding stick - that's a long stick
about 3, 4 inches wide and one and a half inches thick, depends
on the camp. You get your four sticks in like that and your camp
is nice and level. Now you put them in the ground, half bend them
under your foot, right into each side, and build one stick on
another stick. Then you tie it with string, tight, not close to
one another, but spaced. Then you tell the missus at the first
farm house abraod, you ask the man for straw for your bed. Tell
the man you've got a few little children, keep the children off
the cold ground. The farmer'll give you a couple of wisps of straw.
We get this doon the road and toss it all out on the bed - the wife
does that - then you put the cover on. That goes on the ground,
maybe a foot over each side, and you place 3 or 4 heavy stones on
each side. Then pull your rope round the camp stick. Then for a door
in the summertime - you've got two sugar sacks. Pull up the flap
of your door, see outside. If it rains, just pull the flap of your
door down. Put your boots always against the cover to keep the rain
from coming on your clothes. Once the camp gets wet, not wet comes
through. Your cover gets tighter and tighter. And you hear the rain
tapping like a drum on the camp, and you're warm as a pie. And you
lie awake talking to the wife and telling berkler stories, about
kidnapping, grabbers and all. Then after a night of rain, you get
up in the morning, and if it's wet, you're near awood, look for fine
and dry sticks - start a fire. People stirring at the camp. Start a 
fire with little sticks first, then big thick ones, and put them on,
and if you can't break them properly, get a big sharp stone and hack
them over a stone. Snap like. Broken sticks as thick as a fence post.
Hit it on the ground with a stone quick like, sharp like. Hear it snap.
