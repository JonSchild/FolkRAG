to sea [ship] so after they were
out to sea they started their work
finsehed their work and went
down in the hole and 
started to shoot dice And
one [fell] fellow would
hit a lick every time seven and 
eleven. [The] So the the other 
fellows grabe the dice and 
looks at them guess what
were't loaded.
