APPALACHIAN JOURNEY   -20

tradition of black America that fuels the ministral show and
fuels the, the flat foot dancing tradition of the mountains
is still alive as it used to be.
     Here you have dancers who are having a
conversation with their bodies, and a very witty one, and a 
very ironic one, too.
[BACKGROUND DANCING SOUNDS]
In between those actual dance mimes, in
between those feet are talking the language of the dance to
each other and what's linking them is this complex body
based kind of poly rhythm that the African dance, body style
permits you to do that you can't do unless your rhytmic
impulses are flowing from your middle body.
[MUSIC]
Ad the whites adopted black style they
adopted to an already very ripened and very sophisticated
dance style they had themselves.  As you can see here
they're not so fluid in the middle body, they are a little
stooped, some of them, and their arm are beginning to have
that sort of loose flowing rhythm that the blacks have.
And, their feet are sliding and they're getting a lot more
snycopation and a lot more tricky rhythms in because of
that.
