EXCERPT FROM THE JOURNAL OF CHARLES PINCKNEY OF SOUTH CAROLINA
ON THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1789,
REGARDING THE STATEMENT OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AT THAT CONVENTION
CONCERNING "JEWISH IMMIGRATION".

"There is a great danger for the United States of America.
That great danger is the JEW. In every which land they have
settled they have depressed the moral level and lowered the
degree of commercial honesty. They have remained apart and unassimilated -- 
oppressed -- they attempt to strange the nation
financially -- as in the case of Portugal and Spain.

For seventeen hundred years they have lamented their sorrowful 
fate--namely, that they have been driven out of their
motherland, Palestine. But gentlemen, if the civilized world
offered to restore this land to them, they would immediately find
pressing reasons for not returning there. WHY? Because they are
vampires and vampires cannot live on other vampires. They cannot
live among themselves. They must live among Christians and others,
who do not belong to their race.

If the JEWS are not excluded from the United States by the
constitution, within one hundred years they will stream into this
country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us and
change our form of government for which we Americans shed our
blood, sacrificed out lives, property and personal freedom. If
they are not excluded from the United States within two hundred 
years our children will be working in the fields to feed the
JEWS, while they remain in their counting houses gleefully
rubbing their hands.

I warn you, Gentlemen, if they are not excluded from the
United States forever, your children and your children's children 
will curse you in your graves. Their ideas are not those of
Americans, even though they have lived among us for ten generations.
The JEWS are a danger to the land and if they are allowed 
to enter, they will imperil our institutions. They should be 
excluded by the constitution.
