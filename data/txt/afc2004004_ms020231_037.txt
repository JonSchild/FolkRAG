[*FATHER'S KIN, TODAY  (IN BRUNSWICK & ELSEWHERE)*]

They know they're real kin to me.  They're kin to my real father.
Well, they can git me out.  Or either, or git anybody else out.
They haven't got many (HAVE A-GOT MANY?) folks out.  They're
Babbles (?).  I'll show you the place one day.
If you ever go down there.
          I never did go down there an' talk with them.
AL:     You don't go and see them?
BJ:      No, I, I got on the Island. . .They don't know me.   An' I
jus' call 'em up an' let, let 'em know who I [was] were an' everything.
They said, "Come over town," they said, "So we can talk."
They know all, all the peoples I tol' 'em about an' everything,
but. . .Mama, I wanted Mama to go over there an' talk wit' 'em,
you know?  An' so I. . .Mama ain't never
One night Mama (?) said to me, "I got so. . .ah, us workin' an'
nothin' but me an' my husban' is dead an' my children is married
an' big an' grown.  I ain't got nothin'; they got plen'y.  I
[think] figure to myself, they might just think I'm tryin' to hang on to
them or sumpin' like that."  But they, they know better.  'Cause
they call me twice.  But I jus' didn't go.  I feel. . .
AL:     Your mother wouldn't go there at all, would she?
BJ:     Oh, yeah, she would go if I carry her.  But I didn't even
want to go                         .   I believe it's 8 or 10 years an' I
ain't worryin' about it.  An' I go there, I, I see one of 'em an'
know 'im when I see 'im.  You know, you know, by they tell me,
they say that was them.  I [would] wave at 'im, ya know?  They wave
at anybody 'cause they all friendly people there.  They don' know
who they wavin' at!   An' Baby George go over there an' git his
hair cut, an', an' Baby George tol' 'em one day, said, "You gonna charge your
[own,] own cousin for cuttin' [his] hair?"
