Reverend Roe.  Reel 15.  P. 5

"If you look up that chimney there, you'll die."  And so she told him all right, she wouldn't look up the chimney.

He went on and when he come, she couldn't looked up the chimney, and she saw a big bag of gold hanging up there.  And she got the butcher knife and cut it down, and put it on her back and started off down the road with it, you know.  When she's running, she passed by an old cow, and the old cow says, "Milk me."  She said, "I ain't got time."  She kept on running.  She got to an old horse.  The old horse says, "Curb me."  She says, "I ain't got time."  She run down to the mill, and she got to the mill.  The mill says, "Water me."  "I ain't got time.  I'm working too hard."  The mill says, "Get in the mill (hopper?)."  She got in the mill hopper.

The old bachelor come back, and he looked up the chimney to see his bag of gold was gone, and he started out to look for her.  Got on the track, and run on down the road.  Then when he found the old cow, he says, "Cow your'n, cow mine," he says, "Anything what borders fast to serve the dragon on his back.  Water for him, and gallop for him, and all the money I had this side of Georgia."  He went on ahead, and he went on down and said, "Horse of your'n, horse of mine, anything what border last, fast what here ever to serve the dragon on his back.  Water for him, and gallop for him, and all the money I had this side of Georgia."  Said, "She's on ahead."  And so he went on and got to the mill.  He says, "Mill of mine, have you seen anything of my bonny lass, passing her with a set of drag on her back?  Water for him, and gallop for him, and all the money I had since I've been in Georgia."  The mill says, "She's in the hoffer."

And he went down and twisted down in the hoffer and ground her and made her into grits, and got his bag of gold, and went on home.

And so the next oldest girl, she went, and she done the same way, you know.  He ground her up.
