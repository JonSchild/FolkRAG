Dear Mr. Lomax:
I have just returned from Boston, where Idelivered a duplicate
of your instrument to the Linguistic Atlas people. I believe that 
these two instruments have made the finest records, both on metal
and celluliod, that I have ever heard.

I hope ere this that you are making good records yourself. I
am awaiting with much interest a sample of your recording, after
you had the new stylus and the correct microphone in use.

Yesterday I stopped in to see the Edison Battery people to learn
something more about those batteries, I enclose a booklet that
should be useful to you.

I also wish to advise that it is best to allow for the needle
load when testing the turntable speed. Press your finger slightly
aginst the turntable when testing and that should compensate for the
needle load. If you do not allow for the needle load your records
will be made at slightly lower speed than 78 R. P. M. and when you
play back at 78 R. P. M. the pitch will be a little higher. I also
found out that the regular automobile batteries for the same power
as the Edison type would weigh in excess of 200 lbs. as gainst the
130 lbs. for the Edison.

I can build an attachment for using this instrument with A. C.
current for $75. It would be necessary for you to change the motor
each time, but that is rather easy. I am building this for the Atlas
people. You will find it a great convenience quite often.

I can also supply a 6 ampere Tungar battery charger at the wholesale
price of $16.80 (this is my cost ); retail price is $24. this
will fully charge your batteries in about 35 hours. Please let me
know how you are getting along ,for I can read a lot from a sample
record.

There is no doubt that you have one of the two finest recording
sets in the country, and that is not only of my opinion, but of the
expert sound engineers, who have heard it.
