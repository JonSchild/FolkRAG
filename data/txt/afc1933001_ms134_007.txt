Dear Mr. Cooke:
Your letter of June 1 has had the serious consideration of Dr.
Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress, who then consulted Mr. Lomax
and myself in the matter. I am writing now to inform you that the
Librarian has just approved our recommendation that the records be
sent you under the conditions set forth in your letter. The discs
will be sent you tomorrow morning by express collect. They will
carry an insurance valuation of $500. Will you please place the
same valuation on the discs when you return them.

Mr. Lomax informs me that you intend to obtain from "Aunt Mollie"
Jackson of New York permission to use her songs in your broadcasts.
Please ask her to send us some sort of confirmation of this permission
for our files.

I hope that the broadcasts will prove very successful and I am
anxious to hear the transcriptions. I can see no objection to your
keeping a copy of this transcription for your own personal use.

Very truly yours, 

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
