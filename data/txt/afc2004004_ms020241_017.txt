Just, just crackin' at 'em, ya know.  You know,  "You leave here
now; you go back by your . . . You're dead, you stay dead."  All
kinda ol' fool things said they sayin' there, layin' up there
in the bed, talkin'. All kinda ol' crack things about 'em, you
know, with one another, across from bed to bed.
So say after awhile, says it got kinda quiet.  An' says, ah,

to go to they, to the woods there, an' saw down, sawin' down the
trees, ya know.  An' so, Peter said, uh, they all said, they get
