     Another field of enormous importance is the field of 
leisure time activity, so well cultivated by NYA and by the 
Recreation Program of the W. P. A. They are ready to use folklore 
materials that are suitable for their purposes. They need 
song books, records, transcribed broadcasts, books of instruction 
in folk dancing and folk instrumental techniques, and books of 
dramatized American folk-lore of all sorts. 
     There is much for a folk lore division in the Library of 
Congress to do in the defense program and I hope that we will not 
have to wait for another session of Congress before money can be 
found to organize such a working program in the building. It seems 
to me that somewhere in the special emergency funds or in the funds 
for the anti-Fascist battle that the foundations must be accumulating, 
there could be found the money necessary to initiate this program.
