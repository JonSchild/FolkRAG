[WORRY] BLUES*

[PLAIN BLUES]

It's cold and shiny 'till the birds can't hardly sing,
I wouldn't hate it so much, but she soak my diamond ring.

Then I asked the doctor to give me some strychnine,
To stop that brown skinned woman from rollin' cross my mind.

The doctor told me to lay my head on Jay Gould's railroad iron,
And a thousand and nine would ease my trouble mind.

I been drinking' plenty soda water to keep my nature down,
And you know when I get started I'm Hell, Hell all over town.

I ain't no monkey and you never seen me climb no tree,
I ain't see why you want to make a monkey outa me.

It was late last night when I fell across my bed,
I didn't have no pretty baby to hold my achin' head.

"Don't you mistreat her because she's young and wild,
I want you to remember that you've once been a child."

Goin' to snatch me a palin' off my backyard fence,
Gonna whale my baby till she learn some sense.

I went down to the depot and looked upon the board,
Asked the operator which way my brown skin woman go.

He says "If you'll 'scribe yo' woman, I'll tell you which way she's gone,"
I says "She's a seal-skinned brown, chocolate to the bone."

My woman got a tooth and it glisten in the sun,
Soon as she git able, gonna give me one.

Don' write no letter, telegram may get lef'
I want to see you, baby, talk with you myself.

"Gimme a few risings, setting, of that lonesome sun
I'll be back, baby, don't you break and run."

"Baby, baby, would you cry about a lonesome dime,
You got a home as long as I got mine."

What makes your rooster crow about the dawn of day?
To let the kid man know the working man's on his way.

The star's is falling', it ain't long time till day,
That's to notify Teddie that the big bear's on his way.

I'm goin' where the water taste like Sherry wine,
Cause the water roun' here taste like turpentine.

Ain't it hard to stumble when you ain't got no place to fall,
In the wide world I ain't got no place at all.
