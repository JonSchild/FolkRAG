SUPPLEMENT   [*4*]

Because of the fact that I, personally, have heard so few rumors, 
not only during this week but since coming into this office, an effort was 
made to check with various sources to test the accuracy of my observation.  
Following are the opinions expressed, as the result of very indirect questioning 
from sources both local and statewide in their scope:

Cigar Store Proprietor in Large Jacksonville Office Building which 
Sells Cold Drinks and Lunches to Many Men and Office Girls:  This man says 
the principal discussion at present involves the trial of the saboteurs and 
criticism of delay in administering death penalty.  He cannot recall any 
rumors, and says that talk wholly concerns matters which are of general 
knowledge via newspaper and radio accounts.
