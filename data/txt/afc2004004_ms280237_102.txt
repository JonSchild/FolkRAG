Now a parson was sent for, this couple to wed,
So happy they joined in those sweet marriage bands.
It's best to prove virgin, be you ever so poor,
An' make you a lady ten thousand times o'er.

Lomax: Well, I'll be damned.
Cox: (laughs)
(various mumbles)
Kennedy: The only time I've ever seen that it's mentioned as a 
tune, in the jouranl: "The words are not of interest."
Lomax: An' the whole thing. There's absolutely not a word missing.
Harry, where did that come up from? Under the ground somewhere?
Cox: Buggered if I know. I can sing you another little one, shall
I?
Lomax: (laughs)
Cox: This here is a - this here is more a farmer's song. Are
your wheels a-turning?                      This here's the
Rapatap tap song. You never did hear this song in your life.
Doesnt' matter what it is, do it? Am I allowed to sing it?
Lomax: Do you want to rap on something?
Cox: No. I mean there's no harm in it much.
Lomax: No, of course not. No harm in it.
Cox:
So come all you farmer's men, that are both stout an' bold,
If you do as I have done you never will catch any cold.
For when my master goes abroad, for to view the fields so gay,
I go up to the door with my rap tap tap, oh, let it be night or day.
So as soon as my master's back was turned I went toddlin' out of the barn,
I went up to the door with my rap tap tap, I'm sure I thought no harm,
"Oh, no harm at all," my mistress said, an' she asked me to go in,
I told her I was very cold so she gave to me some gin.
