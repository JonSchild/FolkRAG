DRUGGIST
This Druggist, Mr. Earl Pressnall, operates a store at 5464 E. Washington St., in the heart of the Irvington shopping center. Irvington is an old, conservative section of Indianapolis. Practically all of its residents are home-owners and hide-bound republicans. The area is so conservative that it does not permit the sale of beer or liquor.
