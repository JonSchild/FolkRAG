(While I was copying the music in the book, Mr. Mangham was shuffling
and going over other papers. Several interruptions volunteered the following
information.)
This piece, the "Jojo Blues" was called that when it was
first published, but he later changed it to what I think he called, "The Yellow
Dog Rag."
This piece, "Creole Belles," was mighty popular twenty-five or
thirty years ago. It was what you call a "rag."
This was our card when Handy was here. (the two sides of the card
are indicated on the following page.)
The date of this card, according to Mr. Mangham, is about 1906.
