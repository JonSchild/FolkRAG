Dear Lomax: 
    By return mail please give me exact wording for Alan's title. 
Three or four more members have sent in requests to appear on program. 
I am putting them on. Bill Owens and I went over slate today, again. 
I expect to get programs printed at once and distributed. I know 
Alan is going to talk on American folk songs, out want something more 
specific. 

I'm glad you enjoyed Mrs. Dobie's garden and pulled a flower. 
She wull be glad too. She is in Houston. I have been down below 
Cotulla associating with cows and calves. I don't know any garden
scene nicer than a calf little innocent calf lying in the grass amid 
flowers and wrinkling up his pristine nose when you ride up on 
him, still too innocent to run. 

 Rickard is on program. I am writing him another time to so 
assure him. 
Your friend, 
Frank Dobie

Alan: I told Dobies "Texas in the 
Folk Song Archive of the Library 
of Congress." You once said 
you had something like this in 
mind. However, you can choose 
and discuss any topic you 
wish without embarrassment to  
anyone. In your place I'd give 
'em the works on what you know 
you can do that
Father
