"Private Lecture"
As the sergeant made his daily inspection of privates,
one was missing. When the lost private was found he
said:
"Gee! Sarge, I got lost, I'm not used to this place
yet."
The sergeant, taking advantage of the 200 pound
private, bellowed the following:
"When God gave out brains
You thought he said trains
And you missed yours.
When God gave out looks
You thought he said books
And you did'nt want any.
When God gave out a nose
You thought he said a rose
So you asked for a big red one.
When God gave out ears
You thought he said beers
So you asked for two short ones
God! Are you a mess,
And so K.P. Duty for you"
