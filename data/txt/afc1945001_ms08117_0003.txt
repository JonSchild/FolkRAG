uniform admitted free".

Conversation on a Street Car -

1st Passenger - Have you heard the latest?
2nd Passenger - No. what?
1st Passenger - Those folk in Congress have just about made Mr.
Roosevelt a Dictator.
2nd Passenger - Where did you get that dope from?
1st Passenger - They said it in the paper.
2nd Passenger - Now, you just stop that right where you picked it
up.  Why do you think we are fighting Ratso,
Fatso and Japso if we want Dictatorship - that's
absurd.

VI
Meat Shortage
Two women were in the meat marker and asked the
butcher for some meat.  He said he didn't have any.
The butcher had his arm on the counter and the two
women grabbed it.

VII
The man who took Henderson's place said that the
ships would bring back sand and water from
South America instead of Coffee and Bananas.

Is isn't fair for the United States to be fighting
Japan, Germany and Italy, wile Russia and England are
fighting just Germany and Italy.
