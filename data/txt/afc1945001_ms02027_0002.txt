PETTENGILL ASKS 
NEW DEAL DEFEAT

Republican Editors Hear
Collectivism Is Threat
To Liberties.

French Lick, Ind., Oct. 3.--(Special)--
"Liberty will be slain in the
land of its birth if Democrats do
not join with the Republicans to
fight the New Deal effectively,"
Samuel B. Pettengill of South
Bend, chairman of the Republican
national finance committee, declared
at the closing banquet of
the Republican Editorial Association
here tonight.

The former Democratic representative
from the Third district
pictured the political division in
America today as between Americanism 
and collectivism rather
than between the Democratic and
Republican parties.

William D. Murray of Bicknell, 
president of the association, presiding
at the banquet, presented members 
of the Republican state and 
congressional tickets, who joined
with the editors at the fall recreational 
event.

No Longer a Party

Mr. Pettengill declared "the
Democratic party no longer exists
as a national organization.

"It has been swallowed up by the 
New Deal party," he said.  "The
New Deal party has repudiated
every basic principle of government
for which the Democratic 
party has stood during a century 
and a half.  The New Deal party
stands for collectivism, national
socialism, fascism, complete government
control over the lives of 
men....  If they are not stopped
they will fasten upon this country
political and economic controls not
far different from those which Hitler
has fastened on Europe and
the Japs upon Asia."

He said real Democrats are confronted
with the problem of 
whether to "fight the New Deal
collectivists within the ranks of the 
so-called Democratic party, or
whether to join the Republican
party as the present party of opposition
and fight the New Deal 
party with millions of allies and
not alone."

The speaker charged he New
Deal party with infrigement on
state's rights and declared that the 
"states will be forced more and 
more to become supplicants in 
Washington for a return to them 
of some of their own money."

Take Over Government

He averred the New Deal party 
was not concerned with the public
debt and said "they who have vast
collectivist plans realize it will be 
easier to take over the government
if by the destruction of savings, 
everyone becomes a helpless mendicant
dependent on Federal alms."

Building of the vast deficit can
only end in the final repudiation
of government obligations, Mr. Pettengill
asserted.  Social security
card holders then "will have been
short-changed by their own government,
cheated by those whom
they trusted and at a time of life
when they are no longer able to
work," he declared.

Earlier, the editors heard Rue J.
Alexander, Republican candidate
for secretary of state, assail Federal
waste in the war effort.

"American citizens who are buying 
war bonds and stamps expect
the funds which they are turning 
over to the government to be spent
wisely in the prosecution of a victorious
war, rather than for a 
social experimentation," he stated.

"We need more MacArthurs and
Doolittles and fewer economists
and brain trusters," Mr. Alexander 
said.

He said the Republicans have
made good their promises to the 
people of the state to reduce operating
expenses and must refuse
the Governor a request for a Legislature
"of his complexion."

11 Congressional Seats

State Chairman Ralph F. Gates
told the editors that Republican
strength and interest was on the 
rise.  He predicted spectacular
gains in the present majority of 
Republicans in the Hoosier congressional
delegation, asserting 
that "winning all 11 seats is a 
strong possibility."

A feature of the banquet to-night
was a talk by Gregor Ziemer,
author and commentator on war
news.  he conducted his regular
broadcast during the banquet and 
followed it with off the record information
about conditions in Germany.

The entertainment program was
staged by a group of radio artists,
including Miss Dorothy McVitty,
Ohio State University co-ed and
winner of the "Hour of Charm"
singing contest.
