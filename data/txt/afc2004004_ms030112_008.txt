I had a fella one time was telling me, he didn't 
care what kind of women he met, he'd like to 
swing out. Went to a dance one night, fella got to 
danc[e]ing with this woman, a fella come up to him and 
says Listen, I'll tell you because you don't know, he 
says don't be dancing with this girl----- [UNCLEAR] Took another shot of 
Cuban wine, ain't paying attention to this fella 
[UNCLEAR] and he's just gonna take from this girl. 
The girl comes up ' ' ' Come take a dance with me" 
Took another dance. Fella comes up and says listen 
I told you about this girl. Don't be dancing with 
this girl. Took Just another shot of Cuban wine don't 
be dancing with her at all. (Laughter) Second dance 
he took with this girl, he hugged and kissed her with 
a [first] switch [blaed] blade knife (?). (laughter) you understand? 
He gonna do what the Cuban wine tell him to do. 
Ya know you could feel good and feel bad after you feel 
good, you understand? Nobody like to set upon a knife 
for a seat. (Laughter) Nobody wants a shotgun for no 
potato custard.
