Dear Miss Wallace:

I apologize most heartily for my omission to send you the portion of the fee owing to you from the New Jersey lecture. It was a detail that disappeared under a great rush of work in the office. I am afraid, however, until you remind me what my obligation to you is I have for the moment forgotten. Rest assured I will send you a check immediately on receipt of your reply.

Sincerely yours, 

Alan Lomax
