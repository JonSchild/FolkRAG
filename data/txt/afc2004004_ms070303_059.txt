days ago - a stage set, a cold and 
uninteresting straggle of grey buildings 
set among grey-green and unfriendly
hills. And indeed I was hurt by the 
sight of Loch Boisdale as I came 
in on this boat, wishing I had not come,
 feeling the old strain on my heart. There 
on the pier, Dr. Mr. LcLean - he was 
a litle man in a green suit, brushing 
his unruly hair back with [untidy]
stubby fingers & besides him a 
winsome, really winsome girl 
[my God this thing is rolling] 
blond [but not obstreperously so]. 
blue eyes [but small & sweet like 
little [peeps?] at heaven] and he 
came up to the side of the boat 
as we were hauled sidewise to 
the pier & said Is this Alan Lomax
and I exclaimed this is Dr. 
McLean and I came ashore
