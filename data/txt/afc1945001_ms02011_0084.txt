the beginning of the denial. Beginning the denial
qualified phrases or an apologetic attitude gives
the rumor an aura of truth. It has been found dangerous 
to start the denial with such phrases as, "It is
true... ", "We must admit that...", or "There 
is some truth in the statement that....."/
9. If a rumor is printed and is not denied flatly, then
the rumor has been given a wider public and increased 
circulation; the controversial aspects of the rumor, 
or the problem to which the rumor refers, may be kept
alive.
10. Research shows that it is best to use the same face-
type of the same size for both the rumor and the
denial of the rumor. Tests show that where rumors
(or rumor denials) are printed in bold-face, italics,
or special  face-type, readers fall into the habit of
reading all the rumors and few (or none) of the denials.
11. It is effective to identify the rumor prominently as
RUMOR (or PHONY) and the rumor-denial as FACTS or 
TRUTH. it is unwise to identify the rumor-denial as
"ANSWER"; this gives the impression that rumors contain 
enough truth to warrant an "answer."
12. Some rumors are "double-barrelled", i. e. they contain 
false interpretation and a false fact, or they 
contain three or four false facts or allegations.
