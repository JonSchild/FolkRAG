      "So in the Russian composers the rich treasure of Slavic folk-song was not preserved but recreated. These musicians did not repeat the peasants' songs, but learned from the peasant to feel and to sing in their modern way as he sang in his own way." --- Radoslav A. Tsanoff

      "If Greek temples mean culture in Texas, then all New York has to do is to import some more Cleopatra needles." --- Quartet of Norther, Drouth, Dog Days and Live Oak Limestone.
