And every time she'd pass through the house, you know, by, he'd
smack her in the behind, yuou know.  He says, "Sister, you know, I
want to ask you something."  She say, "Well, ask me anything you
want, if you want to ask me," say.  He say, "Well, how about us
doing something?"  She say, "Well, it's all right, but those people
who live right out in front of us -- if we shet the door, they'll know
we're doing something.  Git over, shet the back door, the old man
will see me doing something.  What we're gonna do?"  So he says, "Well,
let's stand up here right by the side of the house."  She says, "All
right."
So he backed up, stand by the side of the house.  They come as done
what they want to do, you know.  And just about the time he was doing
what he wanted to do good, you see, another deacon passed on by the
woman.  And just as he passed on by the woman, he looked and seen, the
preacher looked and seen.  He said, "Well, Reverend, what are you

tonight."

I worked so regular,
And I worked so long,
[W]worked so long
Til I lost the use
of My right arm.
If the sun shine hot,
and the day reallong,
I'm gonna take two shady bushes
To be my home.
Oh, Lord, will be my home.

I will put my woman
To sing a tree.
You ought to hear her holler,
"Don't you murder me!"
That rot-gut whiskey
Is  onna kill be dead,
Oh, kill me dead.

You bring me some water,
and the hammer knock out my brains.
That rot-gut whiskey
About to kill me dead.
