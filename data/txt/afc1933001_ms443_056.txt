Irene

Notes taken during reditions of the song:

This [song]here was a ong-- was a man an' a woman walkin'
along one Sunday e'nin' -- woman she had stayed at home too
long----

(After man has come from Irene's mother)
She didn' like what he said.. So he walked [h]away from
her wid his head hung down--
Cho:
(Intro duction to sometimes I live in de country verse)
[[?]]She asks him was he a town man.  That man was a sorta
stranger to her, but she liked him anyhow. .. He knowed
he lived ninety mile in de country, wasn' even no country
store where he lived. ..

(After marriage)
Every time night come he was gone.  He had her off in a [strange]
strange place.  [[?]]He was a good gambler.  What you mean
a good gambler, he never win a bet an' never had a cent in his
pocket.  Ev'y nickle he could rake an' scrape, he'd gamble
it away and leave him wid a clean pocket, leave his wife
at home wid nothin' to eat.

(A woman) When they makin' up they min' to leave you, nothin'
in the worl' gonna stop 'em. ... She'll git against you
and you can't beg her back.  You [You all can buy her a automobile]
can't buy her back.  You can buy her an automobile and she won't
come back -- you know[how] they crazy about an automobile.
.... Rack on away from me.  She tole him that night before
she quit him, point her finger in his face an' say, ---

quit gamblin' & quit gamblin'
& etc.
