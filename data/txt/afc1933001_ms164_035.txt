The Ionian Singers
The Ionian singers are an ensemble established
with the avowed purpose of seeking out and making
available to the public the best of male-voice music, 
from the days of Palestrina to our own. Its research has
unearthed masterpieces which have been all but completely
forgotten because of the long-standing pre-occupation of male
singing groups with the less difficult ballads and popular hits
of the hour.
These men, though active and experienced soloists in
their own right, have cultivated the rare ability to submerge
themselves in the interests of a delicately attuned, blended
and balanced tonal ensemble. With voices of exceptional
individual quality and range, with a background of long study,
thorough musicianship, uncompromising artistic ideals, and
extensive concert experience, they offer a program that is a 
unique and exhilarating experience--a program of high musical
worth, intimate appeal, and great variety.
ANNOTATIONS
I.
O My Thoughts, My Thoughts Surcease! . John Ward (1613)
It is fitting that this all-British group should open with a beautiful example of
madrigal writing from the distinguish "school" of English composers of the 17th
century, although John Ward is one of its lesser known members. Even the poem
of Sir Philip Sydney is characteristic of the Elizabethan period.

An Evening's Pastorale . . . Wilfrid Shaw
This descriptive reverie demonstrates the power of simple, straightforward part-
writing in evoking a mood.

I Loved a Lass . . . Samuel Reay
Reay (1822-1905), an English organist and choirmaster, might will be called
the 19th century madrigalist. The mocking humor of this poem is skillfully translated
into music of the scherzo type.

Dirge in Woods . . . Joseph W. G. Hathaway
Set to mildly dissonant harmonies and atmospheric effects characteristic of modern
vocal part-writing, these words of Meredith compare our human mortality with the
dropping of pine cones in the stirring of the wind.
