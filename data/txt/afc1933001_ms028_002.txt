Dear Mr. Lomax:
                       In your letter of April 28 you enclose a receipt
for the records sent to you on April 24th at Alan's request. 
We also have a letter from prof Herzog to Mr. Waters acknowledging
receipt of the lot we sent him at the same time, also at
Alan's request.
                         This should answer your query as to what has
happened, but I suggest you write any other questions regarding
these records addressed to Mr. Strunk as he must pass on
all such requests and I know he would prefer to hear direct
from you.
                          With kind regards to yourself and Alan,
                                                                          Very truly yours,
                                                                                 

                                                                                  Frank Megill

                                                                                          Music Division,
         f.m.                                                                               Library of Congress.
