you can run all round it
one person stands about
5 ft from the first 2 &
says Boxes Boxes Shilla Shilla
Ring on the word ring one
person runs right the other
left the singer chases one
& if the 2 meet at back of the
house they are saved if not
the one who was tag is the singers
partner the other the singer
& so on till all have a trial the 
fastest runner is the one you 
never has to be singer
I hope you can make this
out as I am a very poor writer
Thanks alot for your
program
