"Oh Lord, I never stole a cow; I can prove it
by Joe and Bill Thompson!"

On and on shouted the oppressed soul, the mourner at the
mourner's bench, through the entire catalogue of sins that
might be committed on the Texas frontier, while the congregation
sang,

"Or you can't go to Heaven when you die."

Coming down that lonely way through the darkness of that
summer night, this mixture of ludicrous defence and agonized repentance, borne on
waves of exultant song, struck Frank and me with terror.  Our [ * ? * ]
horses moved uneasily; Frank reached over and put his hand on
my shoulder.  Above, the stars shone calmly while the breeze
whispered in the underbrush--

"I can prove it by Joe and Bill Thompson."
