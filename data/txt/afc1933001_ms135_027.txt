Mr. Sol Babitz

Los Angelos, Calif.

Dear Mr. Babitz:

I am extremely sorry to inform you that Mr. 
Martin's records are not for public distribution 
and at the moment we have only the masters and they can 
be auditioned only here at the library, on application to 
the Librarian of Congress.

You are doubtless aware of the fact that 
Mr. Martin has made a great many records for commercial 
companies and I believe that a number of these are still 
available under Victor and Bluebird labels.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
