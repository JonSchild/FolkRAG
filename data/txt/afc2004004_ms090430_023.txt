Negro Communities
Of special interest in the county are the Negro communities. There 
are three of these between Cleveland and Shelby, of which Mound Bayou, the 
largest, is widely known as the "all Negro town". In the "eighties" the 
town was established on land purchased from the railroad company. At one 
time, about 1920, when it reached the peak of its development, Negroes owned 
about 30,000 acres around the town. In plan and lay-out it is no different 
from Cleveland and the other "one-street" towns.

Mound Bayou has today a population of about 800. There are three 
grocery stores, a drug store, a caf√©, three filling stations, a small variety 
store, and the second story above one of the grocery stores is the "hotel". 
Once a flourishing town, it now gives evidence of decline. The best constructed 
building in the town, a two-story brick structure, which was formerly 
the town bank, is now occupied by a promotion organization, the Mound Bayou Foundation. Across the street is a deserted building with a fading sign 
across the front: "Green and Thomas - Drugs". A scramble of bricks alongside 
an abandoned movie house, and now overgrown with weeds, once housed a 
large general store. Down a side street near the school the foundations of 
a once imposing "Carnegie Library" may be seen. The town still has its active 
churches and its schools. 

On the west side of the street are the homes of the Negro planters.
