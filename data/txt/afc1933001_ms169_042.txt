school which teachers found impossible to drill into
my head were Music and Shorthand, both of them very
important in the field of collecting stories and songs.)
But most of my informants, having not sung the old
songs for many years, would repeat the lines as they
were thinking back. After finally getting it all
together they would repeat the whole song or ballad
as I copied it down. Perhaps if they thought a little
more they would recall the tune.

No, I do not recall having heard of the work of
Herbert Halpert in New York; the only person I personally
know who is engaged in collecting folklore
and folksongs is Prof. Harold W. Thompson, of Cornell
University, who wrote that very fine book "Body,
Boots, and Britches." I just loaned my copy of that
book to someone this morning. I hope you have read
that book.

I have already sent my manuscript to the publishers,
if one doesn't take it I will send it to another,
until it appears obvious that my material will
not be published. Then I will rewrite it. If it is
published, which form would be best for me to deposit
in the Archive, a book, or a typewritten manuscript?

If I ever get to Washington I surely will visit
the Archive of American Folk Song and perhaps I
will find you there too, if you are not away on a
trip to gather more material.

Wishing you plenty of luck, I am,

Sincerely yours,
Harold Nestler
