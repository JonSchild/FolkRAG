Perri, Merri Dictum

I had four brothers over the sea,
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 
They each sent a present unto me,
   Porten quartum perridecentum
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 

The first sent a cherry that hadn't any s tone
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 
The second sent a chick that hadn't any bones.
   Porten quartum perridecentum
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 

The third sent a blanket that hadn't any threads
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 
The fourth sent a book that could not be read
   Portum quartum perridecentum
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 

When the cherry's in blossom it hasn't any stone,
   Perri Merri dictum dominee,
When the chicken's in the egg it hasn't any bones,
   Porten quartum perridecentum
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 

When the blanket's in the fleece it hasn't any threads,
   Perri Merri dictum dominee. 
When the book's in the press it cannot be read,
   Porten quartum perridecentum
   Perri Merri dictum dominee.
