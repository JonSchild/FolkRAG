1) Liber[s]t, Liber[s]t-o , conte told by Vitalis Victor.
Begins with song as above. The story is about a girl
who didn't want to love anyone. Her mother agrees--whatever 
is your wish is my wish. Then she changed her mind and she
married Libert, but the king got interested in her. Whilst
lying next to his wife, Libert someone calling...
Libert, Libert-o...
Then Libert opened the door and he turned into a mule. He placed
his front and back legs in position and then he farted. His
wife said, "Aye aye aye."
Libert, Libert-o.
Now Libert is turned into a mule, he can't answer. He can only
say...
Um-mm---
Libert farted again and then he fell down [i]on the pitch(road).
And he begins to sing...
Aye-yi-yi Congo gilon,
