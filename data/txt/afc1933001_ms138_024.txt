Dear Mr.  Waters,

I received the shipment of records yesterday. I am sorry to 
say it was not in the best of condition. Superficial examination 
yesterday showed two or three records slightly bent or scratched,
and I imagine this resulted from the fact they were handled in 
cardboard rather than in tin boxes. I can't remember whether or
not there are any more tin boxes upstairs, but , if Mr. Henderson [say] reports negatively, I suggest that a dozen more be ordered. I will not ship the records I have al ready made and will make 
until I [find] receive [a tin box] tin boxes to send them in. It 
might be a good idea to mail me four. I'll let you know in a couple
of days what my address will be.

Thank you for your promptness in getting the records to 
me, [also] as well as the money. I had no idea that in emergency 
a government salary could not be wired, but I think you are
being a little over-solemn about"no  more  money." What does this 
mean? Am I to be cut off without a penny  or am I already discharged?
With best regards,  I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
