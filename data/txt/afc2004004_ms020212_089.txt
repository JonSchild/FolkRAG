it is a new method and meeting a good deal of resistance.  However, it
is not one of the many California-based whacky medical cure-alls; it
is being used quite widely in Army rehabilitation hospitals
and by many local orthopedists of high standing.  Boots also asked me,
if I mentioned it to you at all, to emphasize that she is a therapist
and works with and through regular m.d.s -- al she might be able to 
do is steer you to somebody who could work with you.  Anyway -- if
you want I will pursue the matter further with her here; if not,
I will forget it.  I know too well who wildly irritating it is to have
people coming at you with various kinds of medical advise.
     This letter turned out to be a book and I have ten million
things to do.  Love and much of it to Anne and Toni and you.  The
girls will see you on June 26th when they hit New York.  Corey maybe
can stay with you for a few days starting June 28th?  Up till then
she will be out in New Rochelle or someplace peculiar.  Could you pos-
sibly let Helen Schneider share her bed -- she's quite nice and 
Corey feels some responsibility for running around with her, since
she knows nobody in New York; she will take off for Pennsylvania in
a day or two?  Let us know quite honestly if this is too much of an im-
position; no-one's feelings are involved.
Much love to all,
Bess
