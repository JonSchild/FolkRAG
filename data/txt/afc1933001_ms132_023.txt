Dear Mr. Lomax:
Upon reading the Sunday Edition
of New Orleans Times Picayune of April 19th
I note that you are quiet an authority
on our Cajuns, their folk lores and 
music.  I hope so, probably you know 
more about them then I do tho I have
I have always lived among them, and am 
a Cajun myself.
I always try to respect a 
person's opinion. Please do not take 
this as sarcasm or much less as 
an insult, but - we know and 
love our people and wouldn't 
think of expressing ourselves as "The best
pay-dirt I struck in Louisiana," 
and also giving your readers 
the impression that those people can 
be and are bribed by liquor, etc.
