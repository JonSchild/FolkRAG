Dear Dr. Ridenour:

    The Archive of American Folk Song is
sending me to Indiana in April for a brief recording 
trip. This will be my first experience
at collecting in the Middle West and I should particularly 
welcome any suggestions you might have
to make in regard to regions and singers.

    My route to and from Indiana lies, of
course, across Southern Ohio and I plan to do some
recording there. If your singers are not too inaccessible, 
I should like to put their material in
permanent form in the Archive. I don't know whether
or not you have published this material or plan to
publish it, but, if you do intend to publish it, it
can be deposited in the Archive under any reasonable
restriction you care to impose. I imagine we could
arrange to furnish you a certain number of duplicates
for use in your classes and so on.

    I hope we will be able to work together in
this project and that I will be able to call on you
some time in the course of this trip. I shall look
forward to hearing from you soon.

    Sincerely yours,

    Assistant in Charge.
