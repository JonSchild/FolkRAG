actly believe in ghosts. I never seen one. But when I'se
out in de fields by myself any nights an' has to come by dat
lonesome little graveyard where dem convict boys, what didn't
have no friends to come and git 'em when they died, is buried,

     Nobody laughed. But the tongues were loosened and for more
than an hour Alan and I heard stories to rival those of Guliver,
Boccacio and Balzac. Clear Rock from "Taylor-town,"
Texas, seventy-three years old, "Been in de pen forty-nine

said, better than the other. Here is one of his tales:

road fum where I live there wuz a sick man from Gerogy. he
wuz sick fur a long time. Dat day some wimmens fum de house
come over an' says dat de man wuz dead. Dey ast me to he'p
wid de settin' up wid de corpse, 'cause day had to set up wid
him until de man's kinfolks could come fum Georgy to look at
him and see him buried. I, bein' as I was 'greeable, I went 
over to de house where de man wuz at.
     De wimmens an' de mens wuz all settin' scrooched up aroun' 
de fire mighty sleepy. De wuz plum wo' out fum settin' up wid
de sick man so long. Pat daid man wuz lyin' over in the corner 
on his coolin' bo'd wid a white rag wropped aroun' his jaws.
