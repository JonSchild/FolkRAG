Mr. Frank Mlakar, Asst. Editor

Dear Mr. Mlakar:

The framework of the TVA problem is used
by Ledford mostly to set forth his own
character among his people in his community.
This material is quite objective and quite
eloquent, a folk expression without being 
folksy, and now that I have read your magazine
through I think completely appropriate
to its format. I judge it might be about
twice as long as your usual article. It's 
the one I would rather do first.
 
                                Sincerely yours,

 

                               Alan Lomax
                               Assistant in Charge
                               Archive of American Folk Song
