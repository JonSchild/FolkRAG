BJ:  Yeah, uh-huh.  That's right.  An' ah, we would load cotton
an' all like that, ya know.  An' they would call me.  Ya know,
I was much strong.  An' I would jes'. . .ah. . .an' they be tremblin'
on the, ah, liftin' up an' tremblin', ya know?  An' that just
tickle me.  An', all right. . .Sometime them white mens come out there
an' they go to lif' up, they got to muscle back an' tremble.  An'
I look at 'em an', aw, I'm stronger'n he is!  An' then, ya know,
sometime we be playin' an' things or lif'in' anything, anything
like that.  An' I'd see where I could do it better'n they could,
ha, ha!  An' ah, (though ?) I was (average?), see, I was strong.
I jes', ah, I jes' done so much work that I ain't strong like I
used to be, but I was strong.  An' ah, so I ra, sometime be in
other places, all about in diffrunt places.  Would op-open a jar, an'
like that, ya know?  I would open it, break the top.  Ya see?  I
was just that strong. I could, I could do it.  I'd open it an'
break the, screw the top off of it.  Sometimes they tell me,
"Don't let Bessie git over to it 'cause she'll break the top!"  You know,
like a fruit jar or sumpin' like that.  Instead of tappin' it, I
open it up an' break the top.  An' I did it an' I s--, I s--. . .many
white mens is tried to open things an' couldn't open it, I said
I'm strong.  An' I have taken things like that, they be tryin'
to open it, I say, "Gi' it to me.  I'll open it."
     He say, "I cain't open it.  How can you open it?"
     I say, "I'm stronger 'an you."  I said, ah, I had in my mind
that I was stronger 'an they were, ya see?  So. . .
