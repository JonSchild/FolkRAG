Rumors

There has been many Rumors about
the food rationing, It was being said
that the United States is sending food to
all of our allis and we have nothing.
And now the shoe rationing there all
rationing shoe's so that the factory's that
made shoe's can make war materials, and
we will win the war sooner and the
people will learn to take care of their things
We probly have enough of canned
goods & shoe's and coffee & sugar to last 
us for some years. but if the war is
going to last long we have to have all
war mateials so that is why we have
to manfacture war mateirals instead
of other things.
