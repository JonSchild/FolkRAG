$1.00 each, this price decreasing
rapidly with greater quantity.

Portable recording machines are [a]
necessary for [every] a folk song
collector who [wishes] wishes to secure
music in its native habitat
where there is the least likelihood
of the inclusion of jazz
influences, where the singers
feel at [home] at ease in their
own homes or amid scenes
familiar to them for a lifetime.
Unless the collective work can be
quickly done it is my opinion
that the influence of good roads and the radio combined will
very soon put an end both to the
creation and to the artless singing of American
folk songs.
