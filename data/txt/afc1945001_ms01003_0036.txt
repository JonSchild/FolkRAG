EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT                                            
OFFICE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To:               Neil DuBois            Date:  April 10, 1942

From:          Don Bussey

Subject:      
I chanced to observe a newspaper photographer in New York at the
corner of 41st Street and Madison Avenue taking a picture of a man
made up as Hitler, being escorted by a detective, while a small
crowd observed the scene. I discovered that it is a newspaper stunt
being produced by the Acme Newspictures, Inc. under the general
head of "Is Hitler In New York?"

I pass the information on to you on the chance that it should be
brought to the attention of someone in OFF. It is my understanding
that this series of pictures will be distributed to rotogravure
sections of newspapers all over the country.
