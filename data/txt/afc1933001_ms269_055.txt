e. Living standards. Close relation to work and wage-
income, food, housing, sanitation - the foreign
quarter and antagonisms loyalties and attitudes
resulting (note: a low standard of living is not
necessarily a carry-over from the old country; it
is largely a product of existing conditions).

f. Adjustment and adaptation. A two-way process:
Immigrants adjusting themselves to American life, and
American communities absorbing immigrant traits -
American industrial life as a great molding force-
industrial and economic standardisation - easier adjustment
in rural areas, except for isolated colonies
where old-country ways and ideas may be retained for
generations  - urban concentrations and the retention
of old ways, prejudices, loyalties and fixed beliefs -
language and religious factors - Americanization
programs - mixed marriages - native barriers and
immigrant inferiority complex - immigrant quota
system and increasing rate of assimilation - effect
of new totalitarian propaganda.
g. Organized life. Religious and social institutions -
religious, fraternal, social and locality
(Ladsmannschaften)  organizations, according to numbers,
size, affiliations - their role in group life and in
this community - relationship with old-country groups
and organizations.

non-English newspapers and periodicals printed in this
country; also papers printed in English but especially
designed for immigrant or nationality groups.)

information (from news agencies as A.P., U.P., Havas,
Wolff, Deutsches Hachrichten Bureau, etc.; from
Legation releases, from foreign correspondants,
from foreign papers received here) - proportion of news
devoted to group, to local and national events in this
country, to foreign events - attitude toward current
