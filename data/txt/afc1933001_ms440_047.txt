Alberta *
This is an old song, says Lead Belly. A favorite with him, it repeats the old complaint of a man who is dis-satisfied and lonely without his woman. The melody is distantly related to "Roberta" and the whole song is half-sister to the popular jazz-blues: 

Alberta, Alberta, 
Where'd you stay las' night?
Alberta, Alberta,
Where'd you stay las' night?
Yo' shoes ain' buttoned,babe,
Clo's ain' on you right

Lead Belly Sings:
"O Alberta
O Alberta
Baby, doncha hear me callin' you--oo--oo?"
"Yes, Alberta hear you callin', what you want Alberta (to) do-oo."

"Run here, Alberta,
Run here Alberta,
Take your seat down on my knee
The way you treats me is sho been [??rryin'] me.

"I woke up this mornin'
I woke up this mornin'
The blue rackin' roun' me bed,
Went to eat my breakfas' an' de blues all in my bread."

Lead Belly Speaks:
He had sont for Alberta two or three days ago an' she wouldn' come. He laid down that night an' he was so sick.

Lead Belly Sings: 
"I lied down last night, 
I lied down las' night,
I was turnin' f'om side to side,
I was not sick, I was jes' dissatisfied."

Lead Belly Speaks:
He looked for Alberta an' here what he tole her.

Lead Belly Sings:
"I sont for you yestiddy,
I sont for you yestiddy,
An' here you come a-rackin' today,
Got your mouth wide open an' you don' know what to tossay.
