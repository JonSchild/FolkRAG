1.  I heard that a marine in the last war inlisted
     in the navy (this war) where he said the navy
     men recieved full credit where the marine
     have about 20% men the rest ride along and take the credit of the 20% 
     workers and fighters.  The navy
     men are all workers (maybe not as good as the 20%
     of the marines) but all equal.
2.  Curtis Wright has a bunch of loafers,
     A man working there (staying at our home)
     said [he told] the foreman told him not to
     kill himself working.
3.  That there is enough explosives at
     the U S Gov. depot to blow the face
     off of the earth [that was 6 mos. ago]
4.  That when you join the navy and
     choose an special branch, such as a radio
     tech, they send you over right away.
5.  If you talk too much
     About our vital plants
     You deserve a kick
     In the posterior of your pants
                              [*(original
                                  ditties)*]
6.  If you can't keep your mouth shut
     like a good litte kid
     You'll get a kick in the butt (pant's
     And wish you did
