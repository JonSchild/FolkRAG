My time is limited here and I need my fiancee to help me in my work. Without your good offices we will be forced to spend two embarrassing and almost fruitless weeks here. I understand that you are alone empowered to waive the publishing of the bans, and, therefore, I appeal to you to aid the Library of Congress and do me the great personal favor of employing this power in our case, a rather unique and embarrassing situation. 

My fiancee will [?] grateful for this act of kindness, which we hope and believe will be done for us. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Special Assistant to the Archive of American Folk-Song, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
