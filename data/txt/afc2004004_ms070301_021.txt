When the evening was fair and the sunlight was yellow
I halted beholding a maiden bright
Coming to me by the edge of the hut
Her cheeks had a berry bright rosy light
The honeygold hair down her shoulders was 
turning
Swinging billowing singing & shining
Sweeping the grass as she passed me by 
smiling
Driving her geese at the fall of the night

John Riordan was well known in [Newberry?]
For soldering old iron & fastening of shoes
And all the old ladies in the range of the valley
Knew the click of his hammer on their tickytack
toos

Well thanks be to Al God, we had won
grand dirty fight -

THE TAILOR AND ANSTEY
banned
forced to burn[ed] his own boots as he 
was dying - shunned afterwards
