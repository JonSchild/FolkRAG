#222 cont.  Tape: Sacred Harp- Int.         3

Harp in a scholarly sense and wrote several books about
it. Buell came along and learned from those books and I
suppose you spent a lot of your adult life singing and
studying it and has found out a lot of interesting things
about the way the whole thing fits together in a human sense
which I found fascinating when I read your book.  I want
to tell you I read it all and I really did enjoy it.

Bill:    Well it was a labor of love.   I grew up around
Sacred Harp singing but didn't really know that much
about it and had to go away to college to discover it and
tracked it back home to my hometown and I was frustrated
by the lack of research that had been done on it to show it
as a prevalent tradition in our area into the nineteenth
century and on into the twentieth, and the book was really
a labor of love digging up the facts about it and putting
the tradition back together.

AL:    The fact is that it incorporates a musical system that
goes back at least into the seventeenth century, doesn't it?

Buell:    That's right.   It's been preserved pretty much intact.
We perhaps added a fourth part to the other three along the
way, the tenor, the treble, and the bass, and added the alto.

AL:    This music stems from the early Bach period of composition?

Buell:    We call it sort of a country cousin of Bach, that greater
tradition.
