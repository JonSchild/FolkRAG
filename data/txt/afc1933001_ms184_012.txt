Mr. Samuel P. Bayard,
76 Barfield St.,
Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Sam,

Bill Durflinger is working for Dutton's in New York.
As a matter of fact, he has recently done some recording
for us there. -- an old shanty singer. I am very fond of him
as I got to know him well while he was in Washington.

I am sorry that your draft status makes your future
so uncertain. We are all in somewhat the same position
I suppose. When I have found out a little more about our
budget for the year, I'll try to be more definite about
the recording project. My notion would be at the moment
that we will send out our sound truck with an engineer 
for your disposal, say, during the period of a month, and 
get some good representative examples of the various kinds
of folksongs available in the territory that you know so
well -- a sort of survey trip, so to speak. Another approach 
would be for you to locate a group of singers and
then our sound would come up to do the actual recording.
Do you think Harvard would be interested in cooperating
in such a project insofar as your services are concerned?

Many thanks for your kind words about my book.
Having just read your paper on the tunes that Mrs. Voegelin
has temporarily in hand, I can be equally effusive. It
seems to me somewhat the clearest and wisest statement
on tunes that I have seen in English and I should like
very much to have a talk with you about it some day.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
