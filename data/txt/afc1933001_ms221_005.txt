5. Some of your introductory
comments on the songs, as I re-read
them, again impress me with your 
gifts as a writer. I'd like to help 
you to freedom for a year or so 
from every duty or influence that 
could demand your time, so 
that you could do only what you 
pleased, write what you please, read 
what you please â€” and then 
see what came of it. Perhaps 
a university with courses, etc, 
might help. I don't know. But 
I'd like to help you to a chance 
that I never had. Think this 
over and tell me what you 
would most like to do.

I am delighted at what you 
say about Bess Brown.
Lovingly, 
Father
