Dear Mr. Lomax,
     As a result of my recent conversation with Mr.
Bowers, I am only billing you for the four records which we
shipped to you. Mr. Bowers has agreed to take care of the balance.
      I would again like to remind you to make your
remittance payable to;
        Marvin Rothenberg, Treas.
     We would appreciate your conveying the above to
the bookeeping staff and hope for an early reply.
         Yours very truly,
     
        Harold L. Frieman
          Vice-President
