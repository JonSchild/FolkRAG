Sat nite 12 PM  Don't know whether
to laugh or to cry - either way I'll
be dead in less than 40 years so
what does it matter?

Finished the rough outline
draft of the Stone of Torey today -
in fits & starts of hysteria. Finally
at 6 completely stuck worked 
up enough confidence in myself to
go to the movies After a couple
hours of Alan Ladd adventure
movies came out to supper very
optimistic, bot [bought] a bottle of Gold
Label pours and finished the
script by 11. Of course there
are jogs & corners to fill in but
the main outline I planned is
down [It's] It s probably
lousy but its my first plot
