(The Kid knows what the great deprivation of prison life is.  Natchez
is a layman in that regard, but he knows that there is something

Natchez: 
(Interrupting violently) 
Yeah, but just a minute! Here---you're

The Kid:  
See 'em, but there'll be a screen between 'em...

Natchez:
[Bill]: (More and more excited) All right, all right, an' down there they
WHUP 'em   .  They WHUP the prisoners down there. 

The Kid:  
Well, they do.....

Natchez:  
If they punish, they got a punishment up here; but down there
[Bill:]             
they really LASH 'em down there.  Cat o' nine tails, you know...

The Kid:

Natchez: 
(Shouts) that's---THAT'S the blues.

The Kid: 
(Agreeing) That gives you the blues.

Natchez:  
That is the blues.

Memphis:  
Yeah, that's the blues.

Natchez:  
Yeah, that's the blues right on!

The Kid: 
Down South is where the blues comes from...

Natchez:  
That's right, but the point I'm trying to talk about is those fellas
