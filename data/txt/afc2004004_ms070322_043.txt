as possible. I also understand
well that this great monster of
administrative imperiallism is
dying - really half dead already.
I have had no serious conversation
with anyone here except
the Scots who have their mts &
their Gaellic revival ahead of
them. Everyone else is eating, drinking,
laughing & being very intelligent
& staying right on the surface. They'd
all get out if they knew where
to run to, & could face the
break.
In districts like Kensington,
Chelsea where you can see Soames Forsyth
stepping out of any door, down the
cream colored steps and down
the quiet, elegant, tree fringed 
street, swinging his cane - now
the houses are mouldy & crumbling
