at the same time I shall write to Mr. Engel, asking whether or not he would like 
to have his name proposed.

As regards the further development of the Archive, the one serious obstacle, 
as I see it, is that we have here at the Library so little to show in the way 
of positive accomplishment. Beyond the Gordon deposits and the commercial records 
presented by the Victor Company there are only a few files and card indices; to 
suggest to visitors and inquirers that the Archive is a going concern, efficiently 
and energetically conducted, we shall need more of an exhibit that we have. 
For this reason I was particularly glad to read that you propose sending us some 
records in the near future. By all means do this. The more material you can 
send in the easier my part of the work becomes. I shall be only too glad to discuss 
cataloguing methods with you when you are ready.

With kindest regards to you and to Alan from Mrs. Strunk and myself,
Cordially,

Chief, Division of Music
