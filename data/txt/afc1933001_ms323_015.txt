SAN MIGUEL ALLENDE

Regional costumes
of Guanajuato are
extremely attractive.
Cannot the
same be said of
the lovely senoritas
of that picturesque
State?

The beautiful
Gothic Parish
Church of San Miguel
Allende is of
a style rarely seen
in Mexico.  In fact,
this photo could
easily be mistaken
for "somewhere in
Europe" - possibly
France or Belgium.

San Miguel Allende
is full of delightfully
picturesque nooks
and corners which
invite the camera,
such as this bit of
flagstone paving
in an open courtyard.

BEING A TALE ABOUT A MEXICAN
TOWN OF ALMOST
LEGENDARY BEAUTY

FOUR centuries ago -- in the year
1542, according to the records --
the good priest Fray Juan de
San Miguel set out from the monastery
at Acambaro in Michoacan on an
arduous evangelical expedition into a
then little-known region inhabited by
Chichimeca Indians some 200 miles
North of Mexico City.  Struck by the unusual
beauty and fertility of one particularly
favored spot in that region, he
there established a primitive church
and named the place San Miguel in
honor of his own patron saint.
   From that day onward the place
flourished like the green bay tree;  before
long quite a village had sprung
up on the townsite which the good
priest himself had laid out.  As the
place grew in importance its name
was changed to San Miguel el Grande,
as befitted its augmented status.
With the later discovery of gold in the
surrounding district it gradually took on 
a character which can be described 
only as that of luxurious splendor.
Magnificent seignorial mansions of
superb architecture soon flanked its

neatly cobbled streets;  fortunes were
spent by its pious townsfolk in
the construction of temples and convents
of an almost incredible lavishness
and beauty.  Today, all this remains,
and today the visitor to San 
Miguel strolls through its quiet, lovely
streets into an atmosphere which
evokes images of centuries ago, drinking
in the sheer beauty which meets
his eye at every turn.
   Yet until a short time ago San Miguel
was almost forgotten for the very
reason that its fame lay in the past.
In facts its principal claim to popular
renown sprung from its having been
the birthplace during the eighteenth
century of that great Mexican Independence
patriot, Ignacio Allende,
whose name was later added to that
of the town.  Recently, however, San
Miguel Allende was "discovered," and
today it is an exceedingly popular
place for artists and writers, both of
Mexico and of the United States, who
come to this beautiful town to live, to
work and to play, in a prodigal setting
which reminds one almost of a story-
book.  It is an ideal place to spend
a vacation, whether or not one happens
to be an artist.
   The famous art school which has

been established there -- the Escuela
Universitaria de Bellas Artes -- holds
seasonal seminars to which come artists
and art students from all over
the United States and Mexico.  Such
splendid work is being done there that
this unique school has won for itself
a world-wide reputation.
   Those who appreciate the beauty
of lovely old places unspoiled by the
meddlesome hand of commercial modernism
will find in San  Miguel Allende
that which is often sought but seldom
found.  In passing, mention should
be made of the excellent work being
done by the Society of Friends of San
Miguel who, with the support of the
Mexican Government, are keeping a
careful watch over the physical aspect
of the town lest any new building or
even a minor alteration of an existing
building be allowed to introduce a
discordant note into an otherwise
harmonious setting.  Thus there is a

reasonable guarantee that San Miguel
Allende will be able to preserve its
truly unique charm, unspoiled by a
"progress" which in this instance is
neither necessary nor desirable.
   The lovely mountains which surround
San Miguel seem to add stature
to the architectural treasures of the
town, providing a rich background for
its many monuments of exceptional
merit.  Piercing the vivid blue sky of
this sunny region are the spires of San
Miguel's famous parish church, one of
the most unusual in Mexico.  This building
is of neo-Gothic design, beautifully
 handled as to mass, balance and\
detail, and was planned by a local
stonemason centuries ago whose
genius, incredibly, was self-taught. In
strong contrast is the celebrated
Church of San Francisco, a perfect
example of the elaborate and ornate
Churrigueresque style.  One finds
equally strong contrast in the Church
of the Oratorio, of Baroque design,
which has a particularly fine and
delicately carved facade.  The exuberantly
elaborate chapel of the Convento
de la Casa Sagrada finds its only
counterpart in the remarkable Rosario
church at Puebla.  These churches are
of singular richness and beauty, and
any one of them would be sufficient to
give distinction to a town of like size.
   Of the many splendid seignorial
mansions, one could stroll the streets
for hours upon end without exhausting
the list.  Those of the Condes de la
Canal, of the Aldamas and of the Zavalas
are particularly outstanding -- if
such can be said of a town full of
gorgeous old residences, each one
rivalling the other and each possessed
of some exquisite detail or details
which set it apart from its neighbor.
The historic and beautiful house of 
Allende is also noteworthy.  Mere description
fails to convey anything approaching
adequacy concerning these
and many other splendid edifices with
which San Miguel is filled.
   As to diversions, the town boasts a
surprising variety.  Fine swimming in
a natural hotsprings pool, sports of
various kinds, horseback and hiking
trips into the surrounding mountains,
visits to nearby towns of unusual interest,
the many fiestas and other celebrations
which play such an important
part in the life of the town, as well
as the delightfully friendly and gay
native life and color -- all these and
more conspire to keep the visitor interested
and occupied.  Several handicrafts
also flourish in San Miguel, including
the weaving of very fine sarapes.
   San Miguel Allende may be reached
by motor over the new all-weather
branch road from Ixmiquilpan on the
Pan American Highway to Queretaro,
thence over simple country roads
which may be traversed in dry weather
only.  Or one may go by train direct
from Mexico City or from Queretaro,
or from Laredo south.  The town has
comfortable hotel accommodations.
But greatest of all, this lovely place offers
in abundance those things which
money cannot buy -- those things
which we must inadequately term an
endless feast of beauty for the spirit.
