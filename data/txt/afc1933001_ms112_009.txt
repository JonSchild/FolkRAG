Dear Mr. Lomax:

In my files I have run across a letter dated several weeks
ago requesting copies of your Bibliography on American Folk Music Released
on popular records. As yet I have received no reply to that 
letter. Could you let me know shortly whether or not I can send out 
a few copies of that bibliography to inquirers or whether the edition
is out of print?  I hate to let my correspondence drop behind. 

It is quite possible that I may be coming down to Washington
Saturday night. Could I call? If inconvenient, also, for me to see you 
Saturday night late and Sunday, would you wire me at my office on 
Saturday afternoon. 

With kindest regards to you and your charming wife, believe me, 

Sincerely yours, 
Bess Lomax
