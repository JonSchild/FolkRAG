Dear Sirs, -
In the recently published 
book by John and Alan Lomax "Our Singing Country" 
I read that folk song recordings made from those in 
the archive collection, are now available to the public.  
I should be very much interested in a list of these 
records, if such is available, together with prices 
and methods of ordering, and any other literature 
on the general subject of American folk music which may 
be published by your department.
I have been, for many years, an amateur collector 
of folk music, and have a record library of several 
hundred recordings, mainly of commercial pressings.  
If these archive recordings are now obtainable, as 
stated, it is very good news indeed, and I shall be 
very grateful for any information on the subject.
Very truly yours
