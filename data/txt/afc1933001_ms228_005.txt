an evidence of maturity and growth,
as well as your willingness to be
lectured by an out-of-date,
devoted and somewhat bewildered
father.  Of course I know, too, that
in your sober, more reflective
moments you must have concluded
that, whatever my errors, I
have wanted to be helpful to 
you - to put before you my
own conclusions and then leave
you free to act as you thought
best (the democratic theory applies
to the "grown-up" members
of a family).  You and I
will both agree that at least
you now listen more patiently
to my suggestions than when
you were fifteen.
