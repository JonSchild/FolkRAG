Dear Mr. Lomax:

    I have just returned from a two weeks' absence in
New York to find your letter of February 6th and now your
letter of February 19th. Since it will take a little more
time to answer the former, I am answering the latter first.

    Enclosed is a copy of the latest report on the Archive,
which you requested. I am also sending you a copy of the
history of the Archive which I compiled from the Annual Reports
from 1928 to 1939, with an index, and I hope it will prove
useful. Will you kindly return this material to me when you
are finished with it?

    I meant to thank you earlier for your kind permission to
use Arthur Bell's version of John Henry and to reprint a
number of songs from your books. Naturally, a copy of my book
will be sent you on publication which will be late in April
or early in May.

    I trust that your book is going along well and if I can
be of any further service to you, please let me know.

    With best wishes to you and Miss Terrill, I am
    Faithfully,
 
    B. A.Botkin
    Assistant in Charge
    Archive of American Folk Song
