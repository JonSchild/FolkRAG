Dear Bessie,
Attached is a copy of the letter I am
sending off to try to get you some dates.
I have already talked to the man who
runs the festival in California in June
and he thinks he might well have you.
I will let you know when I have some
news.
I am also enclosing a  copy of the tele-
phone bill for your long distance calls.
home.  We'll let this remain as a bill
against any money that you make out of
your various tapes and so on.  You
ought, I think, to watch yourself on
long distance calls because they reall
mount up very quickly.
Did you get the new house?  I would like
to know.
Toni and I both send love,

AL:dh
Enc.
