Erin Go Bragh:  John Strachen.
1) My name is Duncan Campbell, from the shire of Argyll,
I've travelled this country for many's the long mile,
I've travelled o'er England, Ireland and all,
And the name I go under is bold Erin Go Bragh.
2) One night in Aurickie as I walked down the street,
A saucy policeman I chanced for to meet,
He glowered in my face, and he gave me some jaw,
He says, "When came you over from Ireland, Go Bragh?"
3) "I am not a Paddy though Ireland I've been,
Nor am I a Paddy though Ireland I've seen.
Although if I were a Paddy, that's nothing ava,
There's many a bold hero from Erin Go Bragh."
4) Then with a switch of blackthorn, I held in my first,
I rammed his big body, I made it to twist,
The blood from his knoppers I quickly did draw,
He made stock and interest for Erin Go Bragh.
5) The people came round me like a flock of wild geese,
Says, "Stop that, you rascal, you'll kill our police."
For every three I had, I'm sure he had twa,
It was very tight times for Erin Go Bragh.
6) Then I came to a wee boatie that sailed on the Forth,
I picked up my oars and I steered for the North.
Farewell to Aurickie, the policemen and all,
May the devil be with you, bold Erin Go Bragh!

Portnockie Road: Blanche Wood
1) Portnockie Road I've often trod when the moon was shining clear,
But another girl has ta'en my part, and I nae mair his dear.
2) He maybe thinks I lo'e him yet, but o, it canna be,
For I am quite resolved now to shun his company.
3) If ever I'm to get ol' him, a him to call my ain,
I'll make him welcome oot and in for the days of old lang syne.
