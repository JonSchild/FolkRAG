A seaman sought the captain's side,
A moment whispered low;
The captain's swarthy face grew pale,
He hurried down below.
Alas, too late!  Though quick and sharp
And clear his orders came,
No human effort could avail
To quench the insidious flame.
                                             4
The bad news quickly reached the deck,
It sped from lip to lip,
And ghastly faces everywhere
Looked from the doomed ship.
"Is there no hope - no chance of life?"
A hundred lips implore;
"But one," the captain made reply,
"To run the ship on shore."
                                         5
A sailor, whose heroic soul
That hour should yet reveal - 
By name John Maynard, eastern born,
Stool calmly at the wheel.
"Head her southeast!" the captain shouts
Above the smothered roar,
"Head her southeast without delay!
Make for the nearest shore!"
                                            6
No terror pales the helmsman's cheek,
Or clouds his dauntless eye,
As in a sailor's measured tone
His voice responds, "Ay, ay!"
