REEL XIV

      Aftah that chile git twelve months ole.
     (So young as that?)
     Ye-ah.
     (Do you think a child that young notices what's going 
on in the bedroom?)
     Yes.  That chile notice a-plenty when it's that young.
     (What about people who are so poor they can't afford
another room for their child?)
     They still oughta be careful.
     (The mother and father won't stop having their life
together.)
     Yeah, but you sposed to have a time an place fur it.
You remeber Christ everything He did, H e had a time an place fur it?
Well.  That shows that we should have a time an place fur things
like that.  Every place is not the place, an every time is not the
time.
     (How would you, in a practical way, make a time?)
     Either wait till that chile go to sleep, or wait
till he took a step off somewhere.
      (Rev. Davis, why ar e you so sure that a little child
of twelve months can notice what's going on in the bedroom?)
     You may not think so, but it will.
     (I don't question what yo u say, I'm just asking what
yo u think about it.)
     Why do I think so?  I'll tell you why I know so.
Cause the more you talk to that chile -- you start talkin to that
