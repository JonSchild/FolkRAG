[*12.13.00...*] A Dance, the history of the folk dance in
America is, is, is really fascinating. Ah,
ah the Puritans tried to repress it, ah, and
chopped down maypoles and said that ah if you
were - ah, that you couldn't possibly enter
heaven's narrow gate in a, in a, a quadrille.
Ah, you had to go in one by one, and ah if you
were dancing and leaping about, that was
proper for the broad ah smooth road that led
straight to Hell.

But on the other hand, ah, there was a
tremendous amount of dancing in colonial days,
as there was all through the 18th century.
This was the day of the country dance, which
appeared from, ah, from ah the peasant world
and simply, and took the courts to - emerged
as ballet in, in, in the [ONE]
world, and, and ah, was codified in the
Playford Dance Manual, and Britain was dance
mad as well. The Scots had their Highland
flings and the Irish were great dancers and -
but - and all that came to America ah was
[*12.14.15..*] seized upon by ah dancing masters, given
rules and, and codes of etiquette, and was
the place where the young man could meet his
young lady and ah impersonally make a first
contact and the girl didn't feel any pressure
