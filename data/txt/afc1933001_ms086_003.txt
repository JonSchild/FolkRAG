Any time in the future You can come down to see Me, We could record these songs listed below, at Your convenience, Please notify Me if You can possibly make the trip in the near Future.

I looked upon the hillside, I saw old Moster coming,
with A bull whip in one hand, and A tie string in the
other, to tie My hands together, You order Heard Me
holler, He said no'no' get down Your britches, for
I love to hear You holler, Old Moster-Old Moster
please don't make Me holler, I will give You a half A  (dollar, probably omitted, J.A.L.)
Old Mistress and old Moster, sitting in the parlor
figuring and studying, how to work A nigger harder,
and old Mistress said that corn bread and buttermilk
was good enough for dinner.

I'm gonna chop all My good time away
If it take Me all day, gonna chop
Dese weeds if it takes Me all day,
chop all My good time away.

Little Boy who fooled You on the river,
Yellow woman fooled Me on the river
in them long hot summer days.

Respectfully, Yours
James Baker
