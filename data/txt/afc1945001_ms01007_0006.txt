"DIM OUTS" of our seacoast cities
and towns eliminates the glow that
silhouettes our ships and saves them
from being torpedoed at night -

"DIM OUTS"  of careless talk means a
"closed" mouth about anything you
know or think you know pertaining to
the war - 

If you don't talk about the war, you can't
possibly help the enemy with information
