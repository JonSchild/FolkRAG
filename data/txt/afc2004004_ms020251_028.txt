Reel of 10/4/61, Side 1, Song 11
WADE IN THE GREEN VALLEY (HEAVY, HEAVY)

This is not a song.  It came from "Bobbin Needle."  When you are
playing "Bobbin Needle" and you get a pawn, you can pick someone
to "Wade in the Green Valley."  How many times you get caught
with the needle, that is how many pawns you have to get, the
judge chants the "Heavy, heavy, hangs over your head," and if you
don't guess what it is he holds over your head, the judge says,
"What shall we do with this boy (or girl)?"  Then the group will
say, "She must go out in the group and get her a boy, etc."  Then
you must get that person and, for instance, guess what he likes
to eat, or what he likes best.  And for each thing he likes, he
makes a step up -- a large step for something he likes very much --
and for each thing he doesn't like, he makes a step back, until
they get close to one another.  Then they can shake hands, kiss,
or do anything that desire to do together. . .You can play the
"Green Valley" part without the "Bobbin Needle" at all, just have
a line of children playing "Wade the Green Valley."  But you can
call them to do anything they want to -- sing a song or jump
like a frog, or anything.  That way it is played without pawns.
