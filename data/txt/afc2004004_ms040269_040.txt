Fur Barraty-parraty!
Gie him ti Charity!
Niver fund clarity,
Niver a clue!

SLAINTE DESTINIE-O
(Tune: Mairi's Wedding (Lewis Bridal March)

First Verse and Chorus:

Scotland's heroes live again:
Wallace, Muir an John Maclean;
-An him, the yin that taen the Stane,
   Johnnie Destinie-o

Johnnie wis the raucle chiel,
Thit gaed ti London at NoÃ«l
An rowpt oor Stane frae oot the bield
    O Dean Don's muse-um-ee-o.

Johnnie o St, Andra's Day,
Burns Nicht an Hogmanay,
-Heich your usqubae an say:
     "Slainte Destinie o!"

The polis daunced an affa dance,
Speirt in England, speirt in France,
Scourt aa Scotland mair nor wance;
    -But niver fand a flee-o

Johnnie disna hum or haw,
Disna brag an disna blaw,
"Ah'll meet ye in Assembly Haa'"
Says Johnnie Destinie-o.
