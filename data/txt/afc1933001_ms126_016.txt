Four days ago I sent you the little Delcos, having just purchased two new batteries. One of them was cracked, and not by rough handling either. Perhaps some particularly rough bit of road did the poor little thing in.  . . . Yesterday I expressed you five boxes of discs.

I wish you could do something about getting my mileage vouchers through more quickly. I have a garage bill owing in Harlan County and the Studebaker grows more extensive to run with every mile as these rough mountain roads devour its entrails and fret its extremities.  . .Please forward my mail through Monday to Hazard and after West Liberty, Ky..

Regards!

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
