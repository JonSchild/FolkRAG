If the N.B.C. continue 
to wish for my services and for 
the use of my name only 
at the rate of one cent a 
record when sold, they 
may not have them. I 
am today writing to that 
effect to Mr. Wetherall. 
His letter I sent to Mr. Spivacke, 
asking him to [send] show 
it to you. Since he was 
responsible for the overwhelming 
offer, I thought 
[he] to him belongs the right 
of first knowing the news.
