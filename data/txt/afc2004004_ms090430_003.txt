          Garcilasco de la Vega had accepted as true the 
fallacy that persists to this day that great Mississippi floods 
are caused by heavy snows accumulated during the winter and 
released by sudden spring thaws accompanied by heavy rains.
          Meteoroligical evidence gathered over many 
years shows that in considering the causes of lower Mississippi 
River floods, great snowfalls in the Rocky Mountains and in 
Canada and the states bordering Canada and the Great Lakes 
may be safely ignored.
          The melting of these snows may contribute to the 
duration of a flood, but detailed records of around seventy-five 
years indicate that they can add but little, if any, to flood crests.
          The determining flood factor is in general continued 
rains through the fall and winter in the upper and lower 
valley and especially the valley of the Ohio, until the land is 
saturated. This condition followed by heavy general rains, in 
the Mississippi Valley below the vicinity of St Louis and in 
the Ohio Valley has generally passed before the water from 
the melting snow reaches the lower river.
           That the theory that the severity of floods 
has been increased through deforestation and drainage of the 
watershed is also a fallacy is amply disproved by the testimony
