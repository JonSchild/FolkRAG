                Dear Doctor English:

                          Enclosed you find the material which
                you requested.  The papers are in their original
                form, and have not been corrected by the class-
                room teachers.  I do hope the stories are legible
                and that the students' writing, on the whole, is
                not too shocking.  These papers are the products
                of a random selection of senior students.
 
                                                                                      Cordially yours,
                                                                                             Doris C. Gallagher
                                                                                       (Mrs.)  Doris C. Gallagher
                                         [*For local reasons,
               dcg: jas             the students were not
               enc.                   asked to indicate race but
                                         the papers were collected 
                                         in seating order & keyed
                                         W or N by the teacher.
