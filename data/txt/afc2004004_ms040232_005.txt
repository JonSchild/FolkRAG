Dear Mr. Lomax

I am obliged by your 
kind letter.  I hope that you won't regard 
my former letter merely as a "[sprag??] part 
in the wheels" of your enthusiasm.  
Nothing was further from my intention 
altho I was not searching 
for folklore songs I had chanced upon 
a few that may be worth following up
[I] [amassed] a list.  I have number [two?] typed
for you and enclose a copy.  My letters a 
[bore???] one but it will give you something
[???] to bite on.  

Yours cordially,
[???]
