Jimmy Raeburn:

1) My name is Jimmy Raeburn, frae Glasga toon I came,
My place and habitation I was forced to leave for shame,
My place and habitation noo I Maun gang awa',
Far far frae all the hills and dales o' Caledonia.

2) It was early in the morning before the dawn of day,
Our keeper he came round to us and unto us did say,
"Arise ye hapless convicts, arise ye in an hour,
This is the day you have to stray frae Caldedonia:

3) We mounted the coach, and our hearts being full of grief,
Our parents wives and sweethearts could grant us no relief,
Our parents, wives and sweethearts, their hearts were broke in twa
To see us leave the hills and dales of Caledonia.

4) Farewell, my aged father, amongst the best of men,
And likewise to my sweetheart, young Catherine is her name,
Nae mair we'll walk  the Clyde's clear stream or by the broomilaw,
Farewell to all the hills and dales of Caledonia.

5) Farewell, my aged mother, in a grief for what I've done, 
I hope none will hold up to her the race that I have fun,
The Lord he will xx protect you wehn I am far awe',
Far, far frae all the hills and dales o' Caledonia.

6) For if ne'er we meet n Earth again we'll meet in Heaven above,
Where hallelujahs will be sung for him who reigns above,
No earthly judge to judge us, but Him who rules us all,
Farewell to all the hills and dales of Caldeonia.

Lomax: Jeanni, e tell me what's the background of this?

Jean:  The song actually is about a young man who got himself in trouble and caused his old mother and father alot of grief and worry.

Lomax: What had he done?

Jean:  Well, it just tells ye that he's a convict.

Lomax:  Where was he sent away?

Jean:  He was sent away to some prison, you see. Sent away from Caledonia.  And in those days they must have sent them away to some Islands or some place.

Lomax:  Where's Caledonnia?

Jean:  That's in Glasgow.  That's a Glasgow song.
