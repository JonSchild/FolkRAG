(Then in the old days they did prefer the ploughmen - you
were going to explain why)
Yes.  Well, it was because they were in the kitchen with them.
They got their meat in the kitchen in those days and some farmers
had no bothies.  The farmers, when they engaged the men do
their six months work, they fed them in the kitchen, gave them
their food in the kitchen, and their was a kitchen girl, [?] a servant
girl there engaged there for the six month and she was dishing
out their food to them, maybe the one ploughman out of the nine
was getting fed in the kitchen and he would fall in love with
her and he used to....and the word was "I have a good mind to try
on that girl, to try her on"  He thought...sometimes he succeeded.
They would,,,she would cast off whiles the times - she would
shove him off, but then it come to be that he used to, used to
take ladders, a ladder and go right into the kitchens, into the
girl's chamber - at night.  And sleep all night with them.
Sometimes they were catched at that game.

(So what happened then)
Sometimes the farmer catched them and then she got her ticket,
she got her walking papers...

(Well....)
Sometimes without a copper

(What?)
Sometimes without a copper - put them away, gave them the sack
as it were - without a copper.  They had to wait, they had to
wait a whole six months on their wages at that time... work a
whole six months.
