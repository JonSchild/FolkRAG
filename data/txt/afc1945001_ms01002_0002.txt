January 19, 1942
MEMORANDUM
To:      Mr. Kane
From:  Cornelius DuBois
The attached memorandum was prepared by Chester Williams of the
Civilian Morale Service, Office of Education, and Jack Potter,
Special Assistant to Baxter in the COI, and to a much lesser
extent, by myself.
I am not 100% sure of the wisdom of the proposed set-up, but if
it is set up, we will be able to tap a lot of useful information.
From the operation of the Rumor Clinics project, we will get very
quick leads to attitudes that would need tracking down in Likert's
operation.  We would also get quick information on certain word-
of-mouth stories about which something can be done quickly.
Barth and Cranston are somewhat familiar with the operation.
