One day while Hitler was being 
driven in the country, and his 
driver ran over a dog in the 
road. Hitler instructed the driver 
to go and express his apologies. 
The driver left and and after a few 
minutes returned with a whole 
armful of hams, apples and etc. 
Hitler looked at him in surprize, 
and asked, "What did you say 
to him?" The driver replied, "I said, 
Heil Hitler, the dog is dead." He 
said, "Thank God" and gave me all 
these things.
