"Oh what made you leave your house an' land,
What made you leave your money-o?
What made you leave your own wedded lord,
To follow the blackhearted gypsies-o?" etc.

"I know I've left my house an' land,
I know I have left my money-o,
So here I am an' here I'll remain,
So fare you well, my honey-o." etc.

Seven gypsies all in a gang,
They were brisk an' bonny-o,
And tonight they are all condemned for to die,
For stealing the Earl o' Cassell's lady-o. etc.

That's how I know it.
Woman: (mumble)
Cox: Eh? (laughs)
D. Kennedy: Very good.
Kennedy: You've got them all beat, you know, Harry, you really have.
D. Kennedy: That's the best version I've ever heard.
(various mumbles)
Cox: (laughing)
D. Kennedy: You usually only get about half of it, don't you?
Kennedy: That tinker had nothing compared with what you've got,
Harry.
Cox: (laughing)
Kennedy: Good gracious me.
D. Kennedy: And you've had it all that time, and it never came out
before.
Woman: I think he wants a glass of beer.
Cox: That's a rum kind of thing. You can't think of everything
sometimes.
D. Kennedy: Harry, if you want to pop upstairs just first on the
right.
