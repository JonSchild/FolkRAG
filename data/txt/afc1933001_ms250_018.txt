Dear Father:
I have just received the attached letter from 
Macmillian's and in view of what Jim says I feel that 
the division of correction costs should follow the 
line of the division of royalties: i.e. two-thirds 
on our side and one-third on Ruth's. While 
there is no doubt that you have a legal right to 
accept the reduction of the royalties for the book 
it seems to me that you should remember that Ruth, 
by the same token, had her royalties reduced. Therefore 
since the reduction was suffered by all the 
parties concerned equally by the residue of correction costs 
should be borne equally by all parties. Ruth might 
perhaps be willing to pay fifty percent of the music 
corrections but I don't think she should be asked to. 
There is no question from the verdict of the reviews 
that her painstaking work on the music brought her 
results. 
One thing I don't understand is why the text 
corrections cost $405. It seems that we might have 
been overcharged there.
You may be interested to see the enclosed press 
release. It means that our documentary programs were 
finally pressed.
Much love to you all,
Alan
