Dear Mr. Tait:

Replying to your letter of April 20th, we are listing
below the prices desired for special equipment for Mr. Lomax:â€“

Item 1.  A set of tubes for the Model E recorder.... $7.05
2.  Complete kit of tools......................  6.75
3.  25 ft. mike cable, including connectors....  6.50
4.  25 ft. mike cable, including connectors....  6.50
5.  50 ft. mike cable extension, including
connectors................................  9.00
[6.  Heavy canvas cover for recorder............  40.00]
7.  Set of head phones.........................  4.25
8.  One set of idler wheels....................  15.00
9.  [200] 50 ft. power cable extension..............  [16.00] 4.00
[*? ________ 4- ________ 100*] 10.  Dural sapphire cutting needles.............  5.00 each
12.  12" acetate discs latex covered............  1.00 "
13.  Light to be mounted on recording machine
for night recording.......................  4.00
14.  Light for VI meter.........................  4.00

With reference to item #11, we do not suggest the Eicor or 
any gasoline driven electric plant as the current derived from
these units do not produce a steady speed on the recording
machines.  We, therefore, would suggest that Mr. Lomax use two
6 volt storage batteries, using a 12 volt D.C., 110 A.C. converter.
This converter lists in the neighborhood of $84.75.

We can supply you with a model E recorder at the cost of
$350.00.

We sincerely trust this is the information desired.

Very truly yours,
PRESTO RECORDING COMPANY
