(What did he say to the horse? Do you mean they had a language 
for taking to the horses?)
No, he'd a different...like it...used to speak to the horse like, quietly, 
and tell thehorse not to kick against that feller, you see. It 
was a' that trickery work, it was all trickery work, you see. 
Well they would get a collar, they would say...they would say
to the feller, "Well, you want to collar that horse." Well,

the horse that they did something, it was something to the collar they did, 
the horse smelt something that was [puttin] put onto the collar, that

perseverance with a horse. There was some horse that you couldna 
handle because they was young and never been carted, you see, you 
had to cart the hose and you'd ta..you'd ta back them- never[y]
been backed. That means a feller never been in a top of its back 
Well it was a terrible thing to get the horse...to break in
