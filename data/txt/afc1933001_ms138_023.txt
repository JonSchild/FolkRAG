Ironwood, Michigan,
Oct. 8, 1938.
Dear Dr. Spivacke,
I suppose you are disgusted with me as well and too busy
to write, and I do feel sorry to have raised so much cain
again about money.  However, I had extras on the car and then
trouble with the slowness of mails here -- much worse that in 
Kentucky, for example. Neither was I aware that government 
money could not be wired.  I shall never again change my schedule
when a check is in the offing. 
My plans are the moment are as follows:
1) Today and Sunday in Marinesco, lumberjack center.
2) Monday and Tuesday in Champion and Baraga, where
I found French singers last week -- the patriarch of the family 
died the night I rolled in and of course I couldn't do 
anything -- I am beginning to think I am Death's special herald.
3) Wednesday morning, an old lumberjack in Green; and.
4) Three or four days to visit folk-lorists, etc.,
in Wisconsin and Minnesota in preperation for next year's work. 
5) Chicago -- where I may stay for a week or a month -- 
on leave. 
6)  Back up to Mr. Pleasant to see Dr. Beck, who
has collected lumberjack songs for ten years and should have a 
machine -- a very touchius individual on whose territory I poach - ed
a bit this summer and who should be mollified and won over to 
our point of view. 
7) One or possibly two days in Flint and Detroit 
where I found material I could not record on the way up. 
Altogether I may need a week or ten days extension of my 
time, not all in a lump, but groups of days.  Please signify
your approval or disapproval by a aye or nay addressed airmail
general delivery Ironwood. 
I hope you enjoyed yourself in New England last week as
much, at least, as the Czechs enjoyed the Munich parleys.  What
do you think of the middle of the road anyway. 
Yours, 
Alan
