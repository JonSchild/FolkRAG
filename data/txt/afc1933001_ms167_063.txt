Mr. Archibald MacLeish, Librarian
The Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

I do not know how much Mr. Cuney knows about Negro folk music, it appears to be very little at this moment. On the other hand it is a fine project that he has in mind and I think that if he is sincere he ought to be encouraged. Few other Negro singers have decided to interest themselves in Negro folksong.His project proposal and bibliography indicate to me that he could learn a great deal by spending two or three weeks in the Archive before he goes South. i would suggest, also, that he buy a really good recording machine and use 12'' records. There is no point in recording rare singing such as he wants to study on poor records.

I think you might suggest beside that these records come to the Archive for duplication before they are worn by playing back in the field.

He has asked me to write a letter to the Rosenwald for him and I intend to do that.
