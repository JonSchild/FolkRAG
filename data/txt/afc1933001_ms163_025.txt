Mr. Roger Starr
Publicity Department

New York

Dear Mr. Starr:

I feel rather sure that Miss Dannenberg did not return
to me all of the negatives left in her hands last year
and that you have in your department what you're looking for.
I've just looked through my files and I can't find them. I"d
like to know if you do.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
