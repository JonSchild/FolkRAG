Wills:
When I went up to London town, upon a market day,
The finest ram which I did see was ever fed on hay.
To me i diddle um Derby
I diddle um day
I diddle um Derby
Upon a market day.

The harns growed on his head, sir, they growed so high an' tall
A man went up in January, an' he didn't come down till June.
(refrain)
The wool growed on his back, sir, it growed so think an' round
If you'll believe me story, sir, it covered nine acres of ground. (refrain)

The butcher that killed the ram, sir, was up to his knees in blood,
There was five an' twenty butcher boys got washed away in the flood. (refrain)

Took all the dogs in England to pull away his balls,
And all the women in England to roll away his pendylums. (refrain)

Now the fellow that owned the ram, sir, he must've been pretty rich,
An' the fellow that sing the song, sir, 's a lyin' son of a bitch. (refrain).

Lomax: Tell me, Charlie, where did you use to sing that song?
Wills: Oh, in public houses, that's all. . . used to have songs
pretty near every Saturday night in pubs, didn't us?
(murmur of agreement)
Lomax: What was your favourite pub when you were a young man?
Wills: (pause) Oh dear. . .
Lomax: All over Oxford, I suppose?
Wills: Oh, yes.
Lomax: What was the name of some that you used to go to.
Wills: There was where I was                   by the time I was nineteen
year old, was the Half a Moon and the New Inn. (pause)
Lomax: Lot of singing go on down there?
Wills: An' then when I got up big enough for to run errands for the
skirts, then Volunteer in the                                      was. . .only three
miles out - three mile out an' three mile to come back, see.
Lomax: And there were some skirts around there, were there?
Wills: Oh, they day 'twas
