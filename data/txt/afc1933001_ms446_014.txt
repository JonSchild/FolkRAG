The Tatooed Lady
(Sung to the tune of the Man on the Flying Trapeeze)
I.  I've just heard a story that rings in my ears; 
   It's one of the saddest a Soul ever hears; 
   To think of it makes me break into tears
    It deals with a Man and his Mate!
   Mother Eve, in her Garden of Eden, 
   Was Tempted, the same as this lass
    And she might have been saved from Temptation-except
   For a terrible Snake-in-the-Grass!  OHHHHH.......
Chorus;
   Shame on the man who pursed her - 
   The Villian who viciously wooed her!
   When she fell in a faint, he pulled out his paint, 
   And the first thing she knew - he tatooed her!
2.Her down-fall began as an inocent thing - 
   Her husband went off to go fishing one spring;
   So she joined her girl-friends to go on a fling - 
   They all went to bathe at the beach.
   Then this artist come up with his paint-pot, 
    With his needle to toy with her calf;
    She allowed him to tinker, he painted a Fiend - 
    Who was sawing a woman in half!  OHHHHH.......
Chorus:
3. The girl wasn't bright, but the fellow was smart, 
    And now that he'd made such a favorable start, 
    He made her believe she was helping his Art.
    They met every day after that. 
    Never once did she think that he loved her,
    Nor did she think that he'd do her harm;
    'Till the day that he painted in red, white and blue
    And he wrote, "I Love You!" on her arm!  OHHHH......
Chorus:
4. Her husband came home and they instantly kissed.
    His eyes read the writing from elbow to wrist - 
    He foamed at the mouth and he actually hissed!
    His rage drove him utterly Nuts!
    She was hurt by his attitude deeply, 
    And hysterically stared to laugh, 
    Then she pulled down her stocking and showed him the Fiend - 
    Who was sawing a woman in half!  OHHHHH.........
Chorus:
5. No chance did she have to explain, for then, 
    He cried, "Never dampen my bath mat again!"
    So now she geta tattooed whenever she can - 
    She works in a circus for pay!
    And her soft epidermis is painted
    With pictures of Sailors and Such;
    And if you have a needle, You, too, can tattoo
    On the skin that they all love to touch!  OHHHHH......
Chorus)  All together now - Once Again!
