Kind friends you have asked
me to tell you, and this I know 
to well, you have asked me to 
tell you the story of how my 
man hood fell.

Me and my wife and baby
liveed through the winter snow
lived through the Summer's
sun shine of 30 odd years ago

Nellie our blue eyed baby
with lips so cherished Red
little did we think of the 
trouble acoming around Nells 
head.

One day there came from 
the city to pass the Summer 
away, A hansome young gentleman 
stranger and with us 
did wish to stay
