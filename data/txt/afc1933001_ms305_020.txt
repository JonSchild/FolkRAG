What is
Happening
to the Federal
Writers' Project?

Refugees for Sale

DIRECTION has a particular interest in the Writers' Project because we have published
two collections and many short pieces of creative work by Federal Writers, of
high literary excellence and originality. BOur September issue of such work received a
warm response and a flood of orders. But already, three young writers represented
here, have been dismissed, along with eighty others, for no apparent reason and in
spite of the fact that they were given written assurances by Major Battley, assistant
to Col. Somervell, that no more employees would be dismissed . . . what is happening
to the Federal Writers' Project? Read the story of an ex-supervisor of the N. Y.
Project on page 21.

Our over this month symbolizes the plight of thousands of refugees kept behind
wire in concentration camps. President Roosevelt, addressing the inter-governmental
committee on political refugees recently, points out that 20 million people may become
refugees before the European War ends, and some long-range plan must be
worked out "if world order, which rests on security of the individual, is to be restored."
He quoted these words written on the Statue of Liberty: "Let us lift a lamp
beside new golden doors, and build refugees for the tired, for the poor, for the
huddled masses longing to be free." See article, page 4.
