A     Looking at Sam, you come on one of the early
ways of playing the blues, which were ah - 

Looking at Sam, you see the blues is ah in
another phase.  There's songs to be listened 
to, songs to be enjoyed.  He's, he's singing
the lyrics and the tunes very - in a very
straightforward way, a concert artist in a 
sense.  Ah, his strum is simple, but the idea
is that you hear in everything are these songs 
- this is how Careless Love was sung.  And, ah,
this is the way that one of the great
performers, ah, Memphis Minnie, um, who's a
favourite of Sam's, performed when she did 
her great song, Bumblebee. [*[*] Ah, mmm, [*[*] one of the
[*1*]   ah most extravagantly sexual of all the blues.
Bumblebee, bumblebee, won't you please come 
back to me/ [*]*] You got the best old stanger of
any bumblebee I ever see/You stung me this 
morning, va-va-va, Come on back, move in,
stretch your stuff/Bumblebee, bumblebee, won't
you please come back to me. 
[*04 . 14 . 27. 15*] 

And [*[*] Sam sings it, ah, in the fashion that he
[*2*] often sang songs like that, for - probably for
ah plantation stag parties.[*]*]
