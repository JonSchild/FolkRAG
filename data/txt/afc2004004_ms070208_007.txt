The levee niggers wdn't work on the farm. Happiest
on the levee.  Man wd have a certain no. wdn't
work in anybody else's camp. Farm & levee
niggers didn't mix.
Rainy days or on Sundays they'd hang around
the commissary, crap games, hunting, go to
town if nearby.
In cotton pickin' time we'd have labor 
shortage -
Nearly always short after payday.  10%
or 20% less. Have lost 100% - didn't 
have a man to take out a team - went 
to town spent their money - next day
a full force -
