P. S. The Library of Congress sound-truck with its 
engineer will be coming to Tennessee for a field trip 
between July 25th and the 10th of August. We can, if 
your project is approved finally by that time, bring your 
machine along and give you your field instruction there. 
We have found that it is a very good idea for collectors to 
operate the machine for a few days under the supervision of 
the sound-engineer if they have not had previous experience. 
I hope it will be convenient for you to drive over and spend 
a day or so with us at that time.
