When I listen to your music I make these music videos in my
head and imagine what is going on while I'm listening to
this music.  I'm shifting from second to first gear because
the (french adjective) bus is going stopped on Johnston
Street in the right hand lane, you know.
MAN
That's why I play that, so you don't forget where you are.
TEACHER #2
Mind control, woo-ooh!
TEACHER #1
What you ought to do is get together a group of busdrivers,
because I am constantly amazed at how many people in my
school-all the math teachers speak French, they sit in the
corner at lunch, they all speak French.  My principal always
speaks to me in French.  The busdrivers- it's like you
listen, there's some great stories that go on in that little
front bench right when the bell rings.
TEACHER #2
Oh, the school busdrivers, I love it.
TEACHER #1
It's unbelievable, you know.  And then young people, because
a lot of the teachers are in their mid thirties and. . .
