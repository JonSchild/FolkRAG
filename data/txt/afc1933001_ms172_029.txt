Dear Miss Colcord:

     For sometime I have been interested in initiating a project
in New York City to record the folk songs of the foreign minorities
there. There are fine singers there in every language and dialect
in the world probably and there are also a number of people
competent to give counsel, direction and advice to such a project.
At this time, especially, it seems to me, that America should make
clear her concern for the cultural riches of the people whom she 
has welcomed into her borders, and no better evidence of this
interest could be given than a project launched in New York City
to record and make available in all sorts of ways the songs of the
national minorities there.

     The Library of Congress, I believe could send the equipment
and discs necessary for such a project. Doctor Curt Sachs, of New 
York University, Doctor Mitchell, of New York University, and
Doctor Carleton Sprague Smith, of New York Public Library, and
others in New York City could guide the project and offer their
technical advice and serve as channels through which the material
could be utilized. There a number of young men in New York
equipped to serve as recordists and field-workers who have already
foreign language associations, social organizations, etc., and
should be expected to furnish all sorts of material for cultural
programs. At the same time basic and important folksong data
would be in the process of accumulation.

     I should think this project could be carried forward for as
little as two or three thousand dollars a year, although, of course,
a great deal of money could be spent. Our experience has been that
one ardent recordist given a little financial backing and good
equipment can do a good deal. I wonder if you could find time in
your busy life to think about how such a project might be financed.

With warmest regards from Elizabeth and myself, I am

Sincerely yours,
