Dear Sir,

I have a
letter from Mrs Emmet Womer. 
of Bellair, Smith County, Kansas.
who you have been in correspondence
with about the song Our Western Home, later called 
The Home on the Range. you asked 
her for a more correct version 
of the words. she suggested I 
send you a copy of the verses
that I have, so I have written
them off for you. I have had
them for many years, but don't 
know if they were the first ones
Printed. in order that you
may know who I am I will 
explain. Mrs. Womers Father
