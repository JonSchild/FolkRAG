AN INVITATION SONG
By O. M. Stucker, Ellendale, North Dakota
Tune--Casey Jones.
Come all you farmers that would like to see
This starvation system in Eternity,
Come, bolster up your spirit and do the thing that's right
And help us to eliminate the parasite.
Come, join the mighty army that is passing down the road,
To relieve the poor old farmer of a heavy load
Of a debt that's heaped upon him that he never can pay
From the dawn of all creation till the judgment day.

Chorus--
The Farmer's Union is a mighty army,
The Farmer's Union is a mighty throng,
The Farmer's Union is a mighty army,
And it's marching on to victory a million strong.

Oh, the Farmer's Union, it has come to stay,
It is growing stronger and stronger each day.
It has big business worried and its got them on the jump,
And we hear them crying mercy, what an awful bump.
We have fed the mighty railroads and we've seen the mighty trust
Scale the heights of fame and fortune till we're all about to bust.
But we call them on the carpet just the  day before we're lost
And we tell those mighty monarchs to dig up. we must have cost.


"UNININITY"
Tune--All I Want Is Sociability.
All I want is Union 'ciety,
Some one to be Unionized with me.
I'm so very Unionized myself,
I like Unionized society.
I have a Union temperament,
Union disposition, Union sentiment,
I'm just as Unionized as Unionized can be,
And I've got to have more "Unininity."
