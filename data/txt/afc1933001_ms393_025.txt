Now there's lots of variety
in Amer folk song-
variety and mood.
You start out with
Skip to My Lou
and you end up with
Blind Man-
[Variety of subject]
Now I want to give a little
picture of the vigor and variety
that is American folk song
- a ? song of irony and pathos, a comedy
of the old man trying to marry a young girl -
? - Old Shoe Boots &Leggins
