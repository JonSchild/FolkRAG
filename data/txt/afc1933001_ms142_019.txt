Letter Number 2.

Dear Dr. Spivacke,

   I left one tangle behind me when I left Washington--
the duplication of the Farmer Collett records.  By mistake she
sent me a money order to cover the duplication
and I returned it to her with instructions to send it to
Radioscriptions.  I believed that she would return the order
to them before I left Washington.  It has just reached my hands.
I suggest that the simplest way to settle theproblem is to
send the records down to him along with enough acetate (six or
seven 12" blanks) and allow him to mail her the dubbings.  That
will rid us of any responsibility to her.  The list of records
can be found in the files in my last letter to Beth Roark or
Monie Collett.  Mr. Henderson can find the originals for you,
the truck can deliver the material and I will write Coar a
special letter of instructions today about handling the discs.
   Enclosed you will find a letter from Presto Recording
Company which mentions a letter I never received.  Perhaps you
opened it and kept it on your desk.  I shall not call on them
until I hear from you.  You may recall that the cutting head was
sent to them for examination only and no repair was authorized b y
anyone.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax

Elizabeth is much better but is still confined to the house
and a long way from being completely well.
