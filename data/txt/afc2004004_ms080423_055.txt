Roll 11, Shelton family continued.

MAN CALLER:   . . .Let's do one.   How many has got a dad or a mom that
has already outstripped you and gone on to be with Jesus?   Just
hold up there, just a minute.  This is especially for you.
My dad has been gone 11 years, last Christmas.   Oh how I miss him.
I still look in that old reclining chair, that old dad sat in. 
Maybe yours, you decorated his grave, this morning.   He's not
dead.   In that grave, he still lives.   (Loud assents). . . On the balcony of that
fair land saying, "Come on, it's far better, Hallelujah."
I'm glad there's a better place than this; one glorious day where
we'll go to sing.   Dad and mom and the loved ones and brothers
and sisters.   Now you can drive (?) on God if you want to.   I'm 
going to have a good time. . .Daddy, I miss you at home, I really
do.   One glorious daybreak, me and old Al'll go down to that
river of life.   We'll have a thousand years, just talk it all 
over (assents). . .(unintelligible). . .Hallelujiah, just listen
to the words.   Daddy, we miss you at home.

WOMAN SINGER:   Daddy, I'm lonesome since you went away
To a land that is better. . . . .

MAN:   . . .First time to ever see the Shelton family in person. . .
There were a thousand people on that side and a hundred twenty
on this one.   Let us take just a brief moment to tell you
the personnel of the Shelton family.   On the far side we
have the oldest daughter of the Shelton family, poor thing.
She's been sick for about two or three weeks.   She's not looked
like that all of her life.   (Laughter).   She's the oldest daughter
