AMERICA

My country thou shalt be
Sweet land of liberty
Where justice reigns
When darkness turns to light
When wrong is turned to right,
When truth asserts her might,
And breaks our chains.

As long as children cry
From mill and factory
On every hand
Can fathers, mothers, too
Refuse to dare and do?
Oh, let our boast be true.
Our own free land.

Our great fraternity
Justice and liberty
To us be given.
Soon may our land be bright
With freedoms holy light,
Protected by thy might,
Great God in Heaven.
