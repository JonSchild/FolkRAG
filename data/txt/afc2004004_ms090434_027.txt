t we see a third gift of God, de-
ed to remove a deep fear from
heart, namely God's--
I. Promise (vv. 8-16).
God made a covenant with Noah
d with his descendants and every
ing creature (vv. 9, 10).  This is
e third of God's eight covenants
ith man, beginning with the one to
dam in the Garden of Eden (Gen.
:28), and closing with the new covenant
(Heb. 8:8).
This was a promise of God's grace
that there should be no more judgment
by flood, and as a sign He
chose the rainbow, which, appearing
in the very time when rain
should fall, would reassure men that
a new flood was not coming upon
them.  What a beautiful symbol!
"I will remember," said God, and
He has not forgotten.  Though thousands
of years have passed, there
has never since been such a cataclysm
of judgment.  How unspeakably
precious it is to recall that God
has not forgotten a single one of
us; that He remembers every promise
He has ever made; that He keeps
every covenant. And on the contrary,
how disturbing it must be to
the unbeliever to realize that God 
has not forgotten his sin and unbelief,
nor the judgment which is sure
to come.
The story of Noah should stimulate
our faith, causing us to trust
God, to obey His every command,
and to look to Him for His power

Faithful in Small Things
Duty, be it in a small matter or
great, is duty still, the command
of Heaven, the eldest voice of God;
and it is only they who are faithful
in a few things who will be faithful
over many things.  Only they who
do their duty in everyday matters
will fulfill them on great occasions.

tion and without res-
Obedience is a virtue that needs,
to be revived, in the home, in school,
in society, and especially in our relation
to God, for there surely should
be no disobedient children in the
family of God.  He merits and expects
obedience.
3.  Trust (Gen. 12:7-9; Heb. 11:
10).
An assured reliance on the Word
of God is a part of faith.  God
made a promise to Abraham.  He
accepted it, and worshiped.  Here
was no questioning, no bargaining,
but simple trust in God's word.  In
fact, there was anticipation of even
greater things to come (Heb. 11:
10).
We need men of vision and that
means we need men who by faith
can see the unseen, who can see "a
city which hath foundations" even in
the midst of destruction and disorder.
"In God We Trust" must be
more than a motto on our coins if
America is to survive.
II.  Faith Brings Results.
The world wants to know if a
thing works before accepting and
approving it.  Well, faith really does
work!  It brings
1.  Blessing (Gen. 12:2, 3).
God is always on the giving hand.
"I will bless" was His word to
Abraham, not only for Abraham
himself and for the great nation of
which he was to be the father, but
to "all the families of the earth"
(v. 3).  How gloriously that promise
was fulfilled in the coming of Christ
our Redeemer, who also was a "son
of Abraham" (Matt. 1:1).
2. Protection (Gen. 12:3).
"I will curse him that curseth
thee."  That promise to Abraham is
still binding and valid.  God is not
through with Israel.  The nations and
persons who have vented their
hatred upon the children of Abraham
need to take notice.
We need to be reminded that God's
protecting care is just as sure over
us who bear His name.  We too are
"safe in Jehovah's keeping," even
in what is perhaps the darkest hour
in the history of the world.  Faith in
God brings to us the protection of
His almighty hand.
3.  Fulfillment of Promise (Heb.
11:11, 12).
The entire promise to Abraham
hinged on the birth of a son, something
which was, humanly speaking,
beyond all possibility.  But because
Sara, joining Abraham in believing
God, "judged him faithful who had
promised," it came to pass.
"With God all things are possible"
(Matt. 19:26).  He delights in doing
the impossible in response to the
faith of His children.  Apart from
that fact we might be fearful, yes
despondent, but "with God' we say
again.  "All things are possible."

killing things have changed so
bad.

PRAYER
Father we thank thee
Father in Heaven
We thank thee for life
For the privilege
Of being a wife.
For children and husband
And a place to share
The joys and sorrows
That must enter there.
We thank thee for flowers
And april showers
For the birds and bees
That hum in the trees.
For country life so old:
Which is as pure as gold
When we pause and think
And to it God link.
Father in Heaven
We thank thee again
For the many blessings
That shower us as rain
For the beauty of living
With people so forgiving
May we ever be faithful Lord
To friends and thee.

assembled at Metropolitan Baptist
Church, corner 5th and Ashton
Streets, and Dr. Dye in turn
delivered the address of welcome
to that Religious Body, to
the City of Clarksdale.
Back yonder, before the world
in which we now live, was shaped
and fashioned according to
plans and specifications of the
Supreme Architect of the world
and all therein is, yes it was
back yonder, before the morning
Stars clapped their hands
and sang together; yes it was
before the beast roamed the
dense forest, or the fowls tried
their wing at beating the air;
yes, before the fish swam the
mighty deep; the character that
I am about to introduce and
present to you at this time, was
somewhere hidden away in the
confines of God's Eternal Wisdom.
About 68 years ago, in the
little city of Cockrum, Miss., in
the County of DeSoto, was born
a little boy of Christian parents
I am sure, as evidenced by his
deportment as a man now; who
caught the spirit in early life, of
dealing justly with all man
kind, regardless of race or color,
and these wonderful traits of
character have followed him
down through the years.
The main objective of my being
here tonight, is to introduce
and present to the General
Baptist State Convention of
Mississippi, the Mayor of Clarksdale,
Miss.  Unlike Mayor Scott
of Jackson, Miss., who sways the
sceptre of authority over a city
of 60,000 persons, nor is he like
Mayor Clint Vinson of Meridian,
Miss., a city of 40,000 people: nay,
not like Mayor J. C. Hamilton of
Vicksburg, Miss., who presides
over a city of 28,000 people,
neither is he like Mayor G. W.
Hosey of Laurel, Miss., a city
with a population of 24,000 people,
but I am talking about a
man who is not only Mayor of
Clarksdale, a city of 12,164 people,
but he is a Christian gentleman
of the highest type, and the
one man who knows no color,
when it comes to acting in his
official capacity as Mayor of
Clarksdale.
When Dr. Dye was elected
Mayor of Clarksdale several
years ago, he polled more votes
than his two competitors, and
was in the hospital in Oxford,
Miss., convalescing from a serious
operation, and was unable
