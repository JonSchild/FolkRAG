Vera Hall, reel 3, page 7.

Were you ashemed on account of it?

V: No , it didn't bother me the least bit then at that 
time, because twas so many of us there like that. We dressed
like that. We was happy. We was just all right. They didn't 
look no better than we did. And we didn't look no better than
them. So when we come out we all looked alike practically,
maybe different colors in our dresses, but it was the same
thing.
So nosir, we wasn't sorry or sad at all, we was always happy.

A: I guess there were some people around there that didn't have
plenty to eat?

V: Lots of em round there didn't hardly have not anything to eat.
Not nothin at all. They used to come to my father and other
peoples that raised a plenty like he did and get buckets of
syrup and pieces of meat and chop fur us when choppin time
come around to pay fur it . He used to let a many a people
have meat, syrup, bushels of potatoes, things like that long
in now (MAY) and when they'dstart choppin they come over in
his field and pay him for it by heppin us chop. My father
raised a big crop and he didn't have much help, but he'd
put in a lots because he'd let people have so much things to 
eat and his field would be just full of hands, payin him back.
Cause they didn't have any money to buy and he said he was
glad to do that. Cose he needed them.

A: How did it happen that he'd raise all this stuff and the othe
ones couldn't do it?

V: They could do it if they was smart enough or had sense enough.
They had the same land, the same priviledge and everything.
