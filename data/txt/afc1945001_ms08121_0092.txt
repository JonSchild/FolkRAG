             A              Rumors
Rumors are the cause
of many hardships,
and disasters. In
cassing a rumor you
are working for the
Axies. The funny part
about rumors is that they
spread and spread and
no one really knows
if they are true or not.
         Rumors do the most
harm in war time.
They originate especially
in a group, such as
card parties, bridge,
etc and club meetings.
     The government has
posted signs up in
such  places where people
gather. Some of these signs
reads as follows.
 "A Slip of the Lip Make
Sink a Ship."
