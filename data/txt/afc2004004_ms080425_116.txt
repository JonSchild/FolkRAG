two-weeks school was 25 cents per pupil. We furnished our own pencil and
our own pad. We actually did paper work just like in school. They don't
teach singin' school like that anymore.

     It was a tremendous amount for him at that time. At that particular
time he was workin' for a truck farm for a dollar a day, and when it
rained he didn't get that dollar.
     And the two of you paid for the tuition.
     Well, at that time he was payin' for five. Later on as a sharecropper,
and money was even more scarce as a sharecropper in the summertime than
it was when he was workin' day wages. But there were seven of us, and
seven of us went to singin' school. We went to the singin' school in
. . .                      County down at Old Harmony Baptist Church, to Charlie
Taylor for two weeks, and the tuition was still 25 cents per student
for two-week school. And it was all day for two weeks.

to do and keep them out of some of the meanness that was goin' on
in the world, even though back then it didn't seem that there was as many
evils as there is today. They were out there, we just didn't have the 
opportunity to get to it as we do today.
