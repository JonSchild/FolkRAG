AL: How did you get started?

Can: Well, my daddy was an accordion player--my mama could
        play too, but she wouldn't play in public, she would play
        in the house, like that.  But I know I didn't want to play
        the accordion, I don't know why.  But I had this idea, playing
        an accordion, I couldn't play anything I wanted.  I looked at,
        and l listened to some old people, they had a few old fiddlers
        there, and they could play different stuff on the violin.
        I say that's what I wanna do.  So I tried to get ahold of a
        violin, but things were so hard in them times.  Then came this
        guy, that Douglas Ballard, he was first cousins with my mama,
        he was a fiddler.  And he was staying with one of his
        aunties.  so I would go down there and meet one of his little
        cousins.  Whenever he wasn't there, we go down there, fool
        with his violin and put it back in the case, just like it was
        before.  Then we started making different song on the violin.
        So, the boy told me, he says "You know what? I got an idea"--
        he was a very smart boy--"We gonna make us some violins."
        And I said no, we'll never get nothin like that and he said
        "No, I got an idea." So he went, and he got a cigar box,and
        we made a (unint) violin out of that cigar box.  Then I said,
        "Where are we gonna get some string?"  "Well," he said, "I got
        an idea again."  mama had a brand new screen door.  We went to
        get some wire from that screen.  Well, it wouldn't sound loud,
