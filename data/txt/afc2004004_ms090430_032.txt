of nearly 600 feet. According to the soil survey of the United States Department
of Agriculture, the topography is "typical of the Piedmont Region, the upland
being out by by the larger streams into major divides, which are in turn subdivided
by the smaller streams until the whole region is a series of ridges, the
surface varying from undulating to gently rolling, and hilly." The topography
of the southeastern part, the region of grey lands, is very smooth for the 
Piedmont Region. A characteristic of this section of the country is the frequent
occurrence of series of low, rounded knolls.

Agriculture is the chief commercial enterprise of the county. No
minerals of any value have been located. Within the county soil types vary
widely. The topographical divisions of the state appear to have influenced
the population distribution. The whole southeastern portion of the Greene County,
generally called the "white land section", because of the color of its soul,
has been occupied from an early period by small white owners who cultivate
most of or all of their acreage. In this section the surface soil is characterized
by pea-sized gravel and the subsoil is very compact, making seepage
slow. The land makes difficult farming, and the farmers on it remain poor.
The seeds of early plantings often rot from wetness. The white land has the
further disadvantage of deterioration more rapidly than the red land. Plantations
could not be developed on such land, and early planters avoided it.
Great slave plantations were scattered over all the other sections of Greene
County, with the greatest concentration of large owners in Greshamville and
Oakland communities in the northwest, the Bethesda Baptist Church community
in the northwest, and two smaller centers at Salem in the southwest and
Bethany in the extreme southeast.
