Port Aranses, Texas
March 26, 1939

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

The San Angelo bunch is my present choice, though you might wait
until I hear from the San Antonio group again. I'll shoot the letter on as
soon as it comes, at least by the middle of the week. By then Mr. Dornbush will
have information enough to make his own choice direct. I hope he will take over
a once all further correspondence. 

The San Angelo bunch are a robust group of Westerners, nearly all
sons of cattlemen. Mr. Dornbush, I suppose, can get some idea of their performance
by having Mr. Broome send on some sample records. They dress their parts, though,
as a matter of fact, they are all probably college graduates.

Always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
