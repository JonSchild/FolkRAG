Miss Melissa, the woman that was stayin' with her, to help fasten
the cosset on me. Melissa musta hada wanted to tell her that already
before. Melissa comes in the do' an' she was washin' dishes,
she had the dish towel in her han' an' a dish. She says, "Uh, uh,
Abby." She said, "That gal ['s] pregnant." She said, "Don't you see
she pregnant?" An' so, Mama didn't make no harm about it. Mama
jus' took the cosset, [she] an' say, "Well, I guess you satisfy now; you
got big." Well, I didn't know what that was. If she's a tol' me
the sense right then, I'd a knowed, but I didn't know what that
was. Thas' jus' the way she said it, "I guess you satisfied now,
you done got big." I didn't know what that was. I figured I was
the biggest girl around there. I went...She put me on another slate
colored suit I had there. I couldn't get that dress on soon enough 
to make it to tell the chilrun I was big. You know I didn't have 
no sense; If they woulda told me, I wouldn't a tol' them. I went
on, I got to Sunday school early; I got there before the children
got ready. An' I was tellin' the Dorset [(?)] girls all about it,
you know, that I was big. They said, "I 'spect you ill." I said
"I ill?" See             (?); I big see?" I didn't know what
in the devil I was talkin' about. An that night in the church,
the[re] none of 'em would sit with me, the[re] none of 'em, they huggin'
off to theyselves, an' I didn't know what the devil what the matter
with 'em. An' they all said, "A course you tol' them today that

what you talkin' about? You don' know what you talkin' about."
   So's, goin' on back home, they [all told] was tellin' me, said, "You 
shouldn't a tol' them nothin'." Says, "Let 'em fin' out." I said,
"What is there to tellin' 'em?" I said, "I'm big." She say,
"You don't know what you talkin' about. Don't know what [a baby] big is."
Tha's all she tol' me. So, an' the next day was Monday. Leonora
an' them came over there. They done heard about it -- Leonora Dorset.
I done told the other Dorset -- Elizabeth an' them -- about it.  You
know, she had just married; she had one chile. She came an' she
said, "Lizabeth!?" I said "What?". I was commin' across the railroad track. Said,
"What you goin' a do? You goin' a town or you goin' a stay in the
country?" I didn't know what she meant. An' so I says, "I goin'
a stay in the country;" I says, "I already stay in the country." She say,
