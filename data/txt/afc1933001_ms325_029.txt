students, who will have an opportunity
to take part in the informal class
work and to meet and hear many
outstanding leaders of the South.

   As usual, the school is arranging
to have leaders in the fields of labor, 
education and government assist
with the program. Under the general
title, "The Awakening South," there
will be weekly addresses by various
prominent speakers. Labor leaders
will participate in panel discussions

   Robert Cruden, publicity director
of the United Rubber Workers, will 
spend a week at the school to offer
special training in union publicity,
April 1-6.

Recreation and Trips
   Highlander will have the services 
of John Morgan, field worker for the
Conference of southern Mountain
Workers, for at least two weeks of 
the session. Mr. Morgan is an expert
recreation leader and will offer a program 
of folk games, music, dancing 
and craft work.
   As in the past, students will be
given opportunity to take field trips
and to observe and if possible take
part in union activities of this region.

Class Work
   The regular Highlander staff will 
be in charge of classes which cover 
such subjects as Union Problems, 
History, economics, Public Speaking
and Parliamentary Law, Journalism, 
Dramatics, Social Science Workshop.
In the class periods students exchange
ideas and experiences and discuss 
their problems under the instructor's 
leadership.
   The staff decided to hold resident
terms in the spring and fall this year
instead of winter and summer. This 
leaves the summer free for special
short sessions, institutes and conferences.

STUDENTS AT REUNION
          FORM ALUMNI ASS'N
   Fun and serious business combined
to make a pleasant and 
profitable affair of the first student
reunion, held at Highlander
last November.
   Students who returned swapped
ideas and brought out many useful
points while discussing educational
activities in their unions. Alton Lawrence, 
southern representative of Labor's 
Non-Partisan League, led a discussion
of political action.

   And the mountain trembled once
again to the voice of Ralph ("Teffie")
Tefferteller, returned for the 
reunion, and the stamp of dancing
feet, as Teffie led the alumni and
friends in one of his famous old-time
square dances.
   Matt Lynch of Nashville was chosen
as president of the Highlander
Alumni Association, and Mrs. Christine
Benson, of Gilbertsville, Ky., as
secretary-treasurer. The executive
committee elected by the group consists
of these two officers and the following:
Jackye Kwallek, Lexington,

at the Birmingham sessions.
Frank P. Graham, president of the
University of North Carolina, was

Welfare Group Is Making
          Study of Grundy County
   Of great interest to all those
who live in Grundy County or
are concerned in any way with 
the plight of its jobless people
is the study of the county just
begun by the American Association
of Public Welfare, under
the direction of Mrs. Gay Shepardson
of Washington.
   A committee of Grundy County
citizens has been set up to work closely
with Paul Savage, Tennessee Commissioner 
of Public Welfare, who
has been promoting the survey. Labor 
is represented on the committee
by Clyde Boyd, of Palmer, a member 
of the United Mine Workers.
   A complete survey will be made of 
the county's economic and social assets, 
liabilities and possibilities. This 
project is the kind of thing Highlander
has been advocating as a step
toward long range planning to relieve
the unhappy condition of
Grundy County.

SOME EVENTS OF THE 
          FALL AND WINTER
   Led by Southern Director John
Martin, a group of ILGWU members
from Atlanta and Chattanooga
met for a week-end institute at Highlander
in Spetember.
-----
   William Buttrick was one of the 
speakers at the Conference on Democracy 
in Tennessee, held in Nashville 
Nov. 4-5 under sponsorship of 
the Southern Conference for Human
Welfare. He discussed "Workers'
Education in Tennessee."
