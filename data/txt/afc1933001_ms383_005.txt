  "Say, Old Iron Head, old buddy, why don't you try to break down a wall with your head sometime."
  Iron Head would light his pipe as if he didn't hear them. The next morning,  though, after Iron Head broke the live oak tree into with his head, he did have something to say.
  He said, "You know boys, last night after I lay down, I began to study about that tree falling on me. Somehow it reminded me of the time my Daddy went hunting the blue goose. Would you like to hear about that time?"
  All the boys said, "Yes, we certainly would love to hear about it."
  So Iron Head lighted his pipe and began to sing. He always smoked his pipe when sang. This is what he sang.
