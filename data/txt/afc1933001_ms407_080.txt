account with them.
"So," the old man told me, "we shot down old Crego, the manager, and left his
damn ol' bones to bleach just as we had left many hundreds of stinking buffalo. It
took us many days to get back to Jacksboro. As we sat around the camp fire at night,
some one of the boys started up a song about our hunt and the hard times and ol'
Crego. And we all set in to help him. Before we got to Jacksboro we shaped it up
and our whole crowd would sing it together. Here it is."
And he sang to me in nasal, monotonous tones, "The Buffalo Skinners." This
song, Professor George Lyman Kittredge of Harvard, the greatest American authority
on the ballad, says, is the best singing ballad contained in "Cowboy Songs." These
are the words the buffalo hunter sang:

Come, all you jolly fellows and listen to
my song,
There are not many verses, it will not
detain you long;
It's concerning some young fellows who did
agree to go
And spend one summer pleasantly on the
range of the buffalo.

It happened in Jacksboro in the spring of
'73,
A man by the name of Crego came stepping
up to me,
Saying, "How do you do, young fellow,
and how would you like to go,
And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the
buffalo?"

"It's me being out of employment," this to
Crego I did say,
"This going out on the buffalo range depends
upon the pay.
But if you will pay good wages, give transportation,
too,
I think, sir, I will go with you to the range of
the buffalo."

"Yes, I will pay good wages, give transportation,
too,
Provided you will go with me, and stay the
summer through;
But if you grow homesick, come back to Jacksboro,
I won't pay transportation from the range of the
buffalo."
