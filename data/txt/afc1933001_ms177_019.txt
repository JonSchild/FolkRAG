Dear Miss Stierhem:

   It may be that I will be making a 
trip into Virginia during the week before
Christmas. I will let you know shortly 
if that is going to happen.

   There are no pictures in existence
of my recording work in the field.
Possibly some can be made at this time.
Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
