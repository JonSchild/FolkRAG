                                      STEAL AWAY
                              A religious school song

CHORUS:    Steal away,
                     Steal away,
                     Steal away to Jesus,
                     Steal away,
                     Steal away, Lawd,
                     I ain't got long to stay here.

                     My Lawd
                     Calls me,
                     He calls me by my name,
                     The trumpet sounds within my soul,
                     I ain't got long to stay. here.                (CHORUS)

                     My Lawd
                     Calls me,
                     He calls me by the thunder,
                     The trumpet sounds within my soul,
                     I ain't got long to stay here.                (CHORUS)
