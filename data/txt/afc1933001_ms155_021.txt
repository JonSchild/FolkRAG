MEMORANDUM
From 
Thomas D. Wallace
Director of Finance and Statistics
D. C. NYA

May we impress upon you the importance
of the following procedure in connection
with the enclosed Form 402.
1. Signed by the worker.
2. Date worker reports for work shown.
3. Signed by person in charge of worker.
This would be done when the worker
reports for work and the form immediately
returned to this office for the files of
the Pay Roll Division in order that the
records may be complete and the worker
paid.
We have had difficulty in the past in 
securing the return of these forms and
your cooperation in the future will be
greatly appreciated.
