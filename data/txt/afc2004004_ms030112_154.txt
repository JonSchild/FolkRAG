MRS. DAVIS:
Well you know Larry, Life is just what you make it. If you make it, married life is just what you make it if you make it good its good and if you make it bad its worser than that, so, you got to make your married life and thats what Rev. Davis was trying to show you to do.
LARRY:
Well I tell you Mrs. Davis, You see it ain't that I'm completely through with my family because I'm not.
MRS. DAVIS:
No, don't be.
LARRY:
But I tell you, this wife of mine don't realize that I'm a man so treat me that way or nothing at all. Not that I'm saying I'm hard to get along with but theres a certain amount of respect I'm gonna get.
MRS. DAVIS:
Oh yes.
LARRY:
And I'm going to get that and thats all. And the quicker we get that understood. She'll have her place and I'll have mine, stay out of mine and I'll stay out of hers. That might not be the Christian thing to say but thats the way it is.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well you see you have two nice little sons and they both look just like you.
