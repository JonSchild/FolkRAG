a box an'... Yeah, I would if the ironin board high.  But, see...
TL:   For your mama or what?

things; learn me how to iron lil' things.  'Cause see, when she
take in washin' an' ironin' that way, I would iron, ah, the, the
handkerchiefs an' all like that.  Ya know, lil' things, ta, ta,
ta show me how to iron, like that. An' would fold the towels an'
iron them, like that.  So that learnt me a whole lot all right, 
but I didn' never like it.  'Cause I didn' mind the ironin' in a
way, but I know they gonna dirty 'em up again, so what [use] need a ironin'
