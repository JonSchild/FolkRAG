Hitlerism
Question: Why do the Germans have to go over into Switzerland to have their teeth pulled?
Answer: because they are not allowed to open their mouths in Germany.

Der Furer
Fe Fi Fo Fum, Hitlers end will come.
Because he seems to be mighty dumb,
then he tried to attack the United Nations,
He found out he had attacked a congregation,
So we're going to send him on a vacation.

Fe Fi Fo Fum, Hitlers end will come,
For only a paperhanger could be so dumb,
As to thinkthat the world would holler heil,
When the proper word is heel.

The German army can march and tramp,
While the U.S. buys bonds and stamps,
Which puts our money in the proper place,
To pitch a tank in der furers face.

He said he lost no / 17 stamp and rocks were hurting his feet.   Folder 114
