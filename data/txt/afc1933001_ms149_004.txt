Sept. 3, 1939.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Remembering your remark that if I came across 
any music that I considered worth recording to 
let you know, the thought struck me that the 
Fair offers some.

I have in mind particularly the native Javanese 
gamelan at the Netherland Indies exhibit. This 
was written up in the Sunday Times early in the 
summer.

There is also the probability that music for 
some of the special films is recorded only on 
sound track and might weel be preserved on discs.

Do you think the Library of Congress would be 
interested in a project of this sort?

Sincerely yours,
Muriel Reger
