much of it.  An' when I'm on it, it don't worry me, but standin'
lookin' at it -- ouu, ouu, it' jes', jes', my haid.  My haid ain't
no good no more now, it's gettin' rough. . .So, cain't stand it. . .

you were little.  Candy pullings and quiltings and egg crackings
and stuff.  I've got on here Watch Night.  What's that?
BJ:  Tha's just like we goin' to have over yonder, ya know, now.
Watch Night is jus' Watch Night Meeting, when they all be at the
church, watchin' for day, 'cause, for a New Year Day to come
in.  Or for Christmas to come in. . .Yeah, tha's right, you watch
for Christmas, too.  'Cause you sit up all night an' sing, you
know, diffrunt songs an' shouts, an' uh, be on their knees
when Christmas mornin' comes.  You know, jus' a little befo' day
on Christmas morning they all gets on their knees.  An' stay
until it's time for the sun to rise, of course they all get then to look to
see the sun shout.  See?  An' then on New Year's Day, it's the same way.
You know, they, they be's on their knees.  They figure if they
be on they knees then, prayin', they can pray all the year.
That was they sign.  An' they be singin':
Oh, day,
Yonder come day.
Great goodness!  They get up an' sing that song!  Because day,
day is breakin' an' New Year's Day.  'Cause that's what they
would do on Watch Night.  An' Christmas Night, see.  Jus' had
