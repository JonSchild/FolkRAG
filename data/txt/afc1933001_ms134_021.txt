PHILADELPHIA, PENNA.
June 6, 1938.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
There has been a long, but I hope not unfriendly
silence betwixt us. I have not wanted to bother you
for I know how excessively busy you and all your family
are. I just drop this note as a reminder that any
time this summer you could get up to Philadelphia,
give us a little warning and "Gran[[??]] and I will be 
waiting with delighted smiles to see you.
If, by chance, you are coming to the Pennsylvania
Folk Festival on June 18th, could you let me know so
that, mebbe, you and Gran could get together that week-
end? (That's just an afterthought)

Sincerely yours,
Kay Dealy
