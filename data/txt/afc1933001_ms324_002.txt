Bob-a-Nellie

1. Bob - a - Nel - lie sit - ting 'neath the win - dow
Pret - ty as pret-ty as pret - ty can be, Oh Bob,
How I love you, Say pret - ty maid will you dance with me?

2. Go a - way and don't you come a - round me
All those sassy words you said Oh Bob,
How I love you, Say pret - ty maid will you change with me?

Formation. Large circle, moving clockwise. Two children in center of
circle, one kneeling and one standing.

Action. When all sing, "Oh Bob, how I love you," the kneeling child rises 
and the two embrace. When all sing "Go away, etc.," all act out the part, pointing
and shaking finger at one child in center. On last two lines, each child in center
chooses a player from the circle to take his or her place.

Lady in the Castle

There stands a lady in the ca -stle. The castle is so high that it
nearly reached the sky, so the first one, the second one,the third follow me.

Formation. Form a large circle, all facing the center and moving clockwise.
The leader moves counter clockwise outside the circle.

Action. When the children sing the last line, the leader taps the first
child on the shoulder, then a second and third child. They leave the circle and join
hands with the leader. The game continues until all have left the original circle.
They form a tower around the last child and sing the song once more, clapping their
hands.
