I. It is rumored that the rationing
of clothes will go into effect soon; 
and all the newsbroadcasts saying
that clothes will not be rationed
is to keep people from buying up a 
lot of clothes. 

II. I heard one woman say that she
knew a woman who lost her ration
book no. 1 and went to the ration 
board for another. In about
a month's time she received a 
war ration book no. 3, by mistake. 
They took it for granted that this
book was for clothes.
