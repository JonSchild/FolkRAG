misguided you may think or however
you may think me [?] provocative. 
I am a far harder
critic of myself than anyone
can possibly be of me
2. To repeat for the hundredth time
I see red when I see you
following my course, under the
influence of others or in harmony
with your own sweet will.
I can't get over not caring or
feeling acute concern.
3. I am getting along in years, no
longer (if ever) well balanced
and I claim that I am due
some special consideration
from all my children, you
especially. This ain't all but
it will serve for the moment.
Your father.
