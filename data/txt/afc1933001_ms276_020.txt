ALLAN LOMAX - folk songs from Haiti, the Bahamas, and southern U.S.

Folk-music might well be called the music of workers and peasants.
Some of the things it is not are: artless, spontaneous, simple, naive,
and so forth. These outworn adjectives have been plastered on it by
outsiders who seldom took the trouble to observe more than that it was
sung by working people. Folk-music, like other artistic techniques, is
an acquired art and has its own subtleties. Indeed, it might be distinguished
from so-called "classical" music by the variety of its forms.

A. Haitian folk-music

I. Voodoo

Although Haiti is officially Catholic, the national religion is
Voodoo, a compound of African and European religious beliefs and
practices. The core of Voodoo ceremonial practice lies in the drumming,
dancing and singing.

a) A song of invitation announcing to the gods that the Voodoo cult
house (hounfort) is open, ready to receive them. Translation:

It's the hour, the hour to unfold the flags,
It's the hour, Sobo, it's the hour.

b) A song of greeting to Azaka, the god of the fields and crops, when
he reaches the hounfort and takes possession of the body of a devotee.
At such times the possessed person is treated as a god.

Hail, hail, hail,
We march step by step,
We march shoulder to shoulder,
Hail, drummer of Azaka.

c) Although Voodoo songs do function apart from drumming on occasion,
they are most often sung with drum accompaniment. Here are two important
Voodoo rhythms, played on three drums. The smallest drum carries the
basic beat, the next largest drum establishes a counterpoint, and the
big "mama" drum "swings" it. Listen for the bass. The rhythms: Dahomey -
Congo - Mayis.

d) So far as is known there is no translation for these songs. They are
sung in the cult language of Voodoo, and it is extremely difficult to
persuade the devotees to explain this cult language if, indeed, they
themselves known what it means. The recording was taken at a Voodoo dance
in the country.

II. Rara

Just as in Voodoo, the Haitian has made use of Catholic saints and
portions of Catholic ceremonial, so he has turned the Mardi Gras and Lente
seasons to his own use. Mardi Gras lasts a month in Haiti and is only a
sort of prelude for Rara season, which is Haiti's Lent. Lent has reassumed
its ancient pagan aspect and has become again a sort of fertility ceremony.
By Good Friday night bands of hundreds of people are dancing throughout the
country-side hunting for the murderers of Christ. For three days and three
nights they pursue these criminals with roars from their bamboo horns and
