Dear Mr. Pipes:

I regret that I have been unable to answer your letter about the Rosenwald 
fellowship sooner. The fact is that I have just changed jobs and have 
been busy getting orientated in the Office of War Information. 

My plan is to ask the Rosenwald people for a group of fellowships to be 
administered out of the Archive of American Folk Songs, Library of Congress,
which will cover various regions of the south in the next two years. There 
are two or three alternate plans of work which I would like to suggest to you
that would fit in with the overall plan.

1. An intensive and complete study of the folk music on one rural
community in Alabama, Florida, North or South Carolina, this study to relate
the folk song and the general musical life of the community to the social
history of the community, a kind of folklore history of rural Negro group.

2. A general survey of the materials of an area such as South Caroline
or Alabama

3. A study of the patterns of folk religion -- all the way from the 
Methodist Episcopal Church to  the Holiness Churches in any region you might
choose.

4. A study of the Negro Holiness Church in the south.

My reasons for suggesting the geographic areas and the areas of study
are strategic in nature. If you have an alternate plan in mind, I wish
you would outline it for me. If not, perhaps you could take the trouble to
develop one of the suggestions I made in connection with some community or region
you are particularly interested in. I leave Georgia out of consideration since
I am also in correspondence with Willis James about this same matter. I also
tend to sheer away from a study of Negro homoletics since we already have in
the Library of Congress a good many records of Negro sermons. What we need 
both for folklore purposes and for crutial wartime use is about the relationship
of folklore to life to living social problems.

I would appreciate a reply to this letter as soon as possible since
I am in process of writing up this whole project for the Librarian. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomas, Bureau of Special Operations
