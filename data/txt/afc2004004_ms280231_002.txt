TAPE 6: JACK DILLON. T3260

Newlyn Town:
1) In Newlyn Town I was bred and born,
On St. Stephen's Green I die in scorn,
I served my time at the cobbler's trade,
But I always was a roving blade.

2) At seventeen I took a wife,
I loved her dearly as I loved my life,
But for to keep her both brave and gay
A-robbing I went on the King's highway.

3) I robbed Lord Golding, I do declare,
I robbed Lady Mannering in Grosvenor Square,
I robbed them of their gold so bright,
And I took it home to my heart's delight.

4) To Covent Garden we went straightway,
Me and my wife we went to the play,
Ned Fielding's gang did me pursue,
And taken I was by that cursed crew.

5) Now when I am dead and go to my grave,
A decent funeral let me have,
Six highwaymen for to carry me,
Give them broadswords and sweet liberty.

6) Six blooming maidens to bear my pall,
Give them white gloves and sweet ribbons all,
That when I am dead, they may tell the truth,
"Here lies a bold but wicked youth."

The Whore of Dumblaire:
On a wee chuckin' stane sat a bonnie wee lassie,
Her cant was all tattered and torn,
An old man espied her and sat down beside her,
Now that was wee lassie's the whore od Dunblaire.

O'Riley's Daughter:
1) As I was sitting by the fire, talking to O'Riley's daughter,
Suddenly a thought came into my head,
I'd like to fuck O'Riley's daughter.
Yiddy-i-aye, yiddy-i-aye,
Yiddy-i-aye to the one-eyed Riley,
Bom-bom-bom, balls and all,
Jig a jig jig, tres bon.
