AL:   I think they have room over at the Holiday Inn. . . Well, 
they been telling me about yuo for years.  You're how old?

Man:   Well, if I live to the 12th of August, I'll be 90.  
I was born in Greenville, Mississippi and my daddy and 
mother came back to grandpappy Denson's place-- Arbacoochy, 
in Cleveland County-- when I was small, and then we 
stayed there until we moved to north Alabama--Winston 
County--place called Neesmith then, Addison now-- 2 
little towns close together.  We got our mail over that 
way--Neesmith, Alabama, Addison, Alabama.

AL:   You're a Denson, are you?

Man:   Robert Edward Denson..They call me Uncle Bob, everybody 
does.

AL:   Now, Densons are awfully important in Sacred Harp-
they've done an awful lot.

Uncle Bob:   Well, 1911, my mother and daddy went up to Atlanta, 
GA, to George Ames, and revised the book.  George Ames. . 
he was a lawyer, he lived. . . .  He was a lawyer and he 
got my daddy to revise the book.  He furnished the money 
a nd my daddy did the work.   And my mother put the scripture 
references in the bible there.  My mother did that in 1911.  
Yeah, when he was up there she helped with it.
