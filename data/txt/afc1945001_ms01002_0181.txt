OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To:  R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director          Date: March 23, 1942
From: J. A. Swords and Eugene Katz
Subject:  Rumor Discovery and Correction -- A Suggested Procedure

1. Detection of rumors -- machinery for finding  out what the
rumors are

(a)  Field Staffs now in Government employ -- OOPA, OGR, 
Department of Agriculture, Likert's organization, 
panels of correspondents, Defense Bonds field crew
(Odegard).  Utilize these investigatory staffs to 
find out the location of rumors as to place, groups, 
and extent, as well as content

2. Correction of rumors

(a) Proper correction of rumors calls for the provision of
adequate information by the Military themselves.  Suggest
frequent Army and Navy communiques, covering as much
material as possible

(b) Tip sheet telling [place and radius of] press and radio the nature and 
dimensions of prevalent rumors so that they may use 
their own facilities and others provided by the OFF 
to combat these rumors and prevent further diffusion by 
themselves

(c) General dramatic  treatment in press feature articles and
radio scripts interestingly describing  how hypothetical
rumors spread and discrediting rumor mongers

(d) Advise[ing] press and radio to communicate with OFF to learn
possible answers to [material] rumors they may consider [rumors]of 
sufficient importance to merit [treatment] refutation.
   
(e) (?) Organize on-the-spot rumor analysis groups who may 
provide their own antidotes to specific local rumors, via press
and radio.

3.  How do rumors spread?

(a) For long range work a study should be made in one or
several communities to determine the life history of an
actual rumor in those communities
