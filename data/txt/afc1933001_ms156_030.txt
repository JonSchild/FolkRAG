FRED WARING'S PENNSYLVANIANS 
1697 Broadway, New York City 

Belly's look of pious regret in a state of frustrated convulsions. 
I think the only way Woody could ever conclusively triumph over 
Lead Belly would be to get himself a lady professor (a real pretty one, 
just to rub it in) who can be erudite about him prior to his singing 
and who can tartly mix it up with Miss Barnacle.  I bet there's a 
real opening for a distinguished blonde with a sharp tongue. 

                      As I didn't hear from you regarding the appointment at 
McCall's, I assumed you wanted to drop it for some reason.  If you 
and Mrs. Lomax ever have any time, we'd certainly like to have you 
come over to one of the broadcasts.  I'll keep you posted on the 
progress of the piece. 

Sincerely yours, 
Hilda Cole
