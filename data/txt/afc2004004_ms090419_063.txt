The Boll Weevil - recited by Ada Wave

The man says, "I believe I'll try to get rid
of these boll weevils, you know, He says I'm
gonna gather'm up & put um in a sack
& then put um in aluminum [a baloon]  & send um
away. Boll weevil says, I be back when the 
cotton bloom, because I have a home everywhere
I go.

One man taken the boll weevil, he put him 
in the pond, you know. He covered him up
say. Well I'm gonna give you trouble heading
up yo land because I have, etc

Well, another man say, I'm gonna take
the boll weevil, put him between two blocks 
of ice - boll weevil says I'm living a
millionaireâ€™s life, because, etc..

And one man went to the bowsman,
say, Cap'n I want a peck of meal -
say go way, nigger, you got boll weevils
in yo' field.
