314 S.  Washington Street
Bloomington, Indiana

Dear Mrs. Rogers:

Let me thank you again in the name of the
Library of Congress and the Division of Music
for your help in finding folk-singers for me
in Bloomington. Your workers, especially Mr.
Collier, made a valuable contribution to the
Indiana collection. Please give them our very
best regards.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
