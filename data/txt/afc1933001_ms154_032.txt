My dear Mr. Lomax:

We believe that in the best interest of our artists and speakers, 
they should be represented in advertising through the only trade magazine in
the lecture and entertainment field, "Program", which is undoubtedly well known
to you. 

It is our feeling that a full four-page spread in the middle two
pages of this magazine carried regularly in every issue - of which there are 
nine each year - would adequately present the list of speakers and artists to 
the general buying public. 

We propose that all artists under our management agree to be included
in this listing. No one will be featured, everyone being given the same
amount of space with the same size picture, the cost to be divided equally among
all persons listed. 

The cost for this ad will run approximately $10.00 per month to
each artist. 

It seems to us that since the field is so competitive, this one advertising
field is necessary and we would very much appreciate having your approval
of this plan. We will bill you each month for your chare of the cost of
this advertisement. 

[*What cuts?*]
The cost of cuts, of course, will be borne by the speaker, but
these can be standardized for use during the entire year and should not cost
more than three or four dollars each. 

Please sign under the word "approved" below to indicate your approval
of and consent to the foregoing and return promptly to us. 

Sincerely yours, 
Isabel R. Scott (Signature)

Note: Costs to be deducted at
the rate of $10.00 per engagement
from fees next season.
