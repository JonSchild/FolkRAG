     (What  make some people greedy like that?)
     Lack of guidance. . .Can't have it all.  Thass like a dog
h ave a bone his his mouth an got two three in his paws an growlin
ovah dem.  He can't eat em all but he won't let the othah dog have
nary one. . .Thass the way a dog is.
     (Do you think people who behave that way are dogs?)
     Thass the way some people is.  Thass right.  I wouldn't 
call that nothin but a dog.  May layin wid one woman, feelin ovah
anothah one.

     (Did yo u do it yo urself?)
     Hahah hah-hah hah-hah!  (he snuffles big drops of
water back up in his nose, brought down from his apparently
ever-flowing head glands and ducts by this laughter) Ahhh hhhhh!. . . .
