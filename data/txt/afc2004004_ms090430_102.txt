About 1903 steam tractors began coming into quite general use 
for motive power and especially for pulling elevating graders.  The 
gas tractor appeared a few years later and from that time on mules 
were rapidly replaced by tractors and trucks.  Today levee construction 
is completely motorized and it is now unusual for contractors 
to employ any mules on earth moving jobs.

It is interesting to note that prices per cubic yard of embankment 
by hauling equipment today is practically the same as it 
was sixty years ago when quite formidable levees were rolled into 
place by Irish station men or "Humpers."

As the levees were increased in size and became more definitely 
permanent the question of proper maintenance became of constantly 
greater importance and a more formidable item of expense.

By 1912 the annual cost of these operations had risen to approximately 
$50,000.00, and by 1918 the levee system had become 
so well established that it became evident that a permanent system 
for maintenance should be established.

Accordingly station headquarters consisting of a foreman's 
house, laborers' house, mule barn and an implement shed was constructed 
at about 8 mile intervals along the levee and a foreman was placed in 
charge of each station.  Each station was equipped with 11 mules, about 
6 wheeled scrapers, several slip scrapers, generally several fresno 
scrapers, about 3 wagons, about 4 mowing machines and with necessary 
small tools.  The labor complement averaged about 8 men which was increased 
or diminished as conditions required.

This system has operated with remarkable success and in the main 
is the system employed at the present time except that mules have in 
general been displaced by tractors.

To repair flood damage after the 1927 flood it was necessary 
to supplement the station forces with a 20 team wheeled scraper outfit.  
This outfit was disbanded in 1935 and replaced with the much more ef-
