Jokes

A lady went in to a butcher shop
and asked the butcher if he had
any chops. The butcher said yes. So
she took all of them. She asked
for several other cuts. He gave them
to her and roped up the bundle.
She asked him if he would deliver 
it, because it was so heavy.
He said "no". She said why not, your
cart is out in front.
He said I know lady but you just
bought my horse.
