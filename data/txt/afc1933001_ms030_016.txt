page; they really ought to be referred differently; by number and letter respectively, or some other method. 3). The various signs not used in our musical practice are explained in my remarks now. If you think it would be wise to explain each of them also with a footnote the first time they occur in the music, I should enter these footnotes. I am leaving for Europe on the 9th of July, from New York; will be in New York between the 7th and 9th, and will be very glad to look in on Macmilliands and add these details or check on whatever there is anything to check. You may let me know what you think about points 1. 2. and 3.

                                                    Unfortunately there are still a few things to be sent in to you which I must do from new Haven where I shall be again in a few days. These are: a transcription of 30 days in the Workhouse, Mr. Tom Hughe's Town, and another record of Hoday, Ol' Man settin' in the Corner Dyin' and Green Corn. Alan suggested changes in these but I left his letter at New Haven and must check them against the letter. After these last details are out of the way, I shall be ready to send the record wherever you wish to have them. 
                                                        I shall be very interested in your Cowboy Cylinders and very glad to look them over whenever convenient. I will be able to look them over before leaving for Europe and to write you about my findings, suggesting what I'd think might be done with them. Whatever I can do with them I will be more than glad to do, in the Falls will be back in the states beginning of October, and can tackle them then before thinking of anything else. 
                                                            i seem to have taken up all matters of detail and will take up what I may have forgotten with a less sluggish mind and a more readable script, on my return to New Haven, sending the last transcriptions.
