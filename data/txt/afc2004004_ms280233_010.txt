8) O then if I had you back again
I'd never let you go to fight the king of Spain,
For I'd rather have my Ted as he used to be
Then the king of France and his whole navy.
9) All foreign wars I do proclaim
Between Don Juan and the king of Spain,
And, be heavens, I'll make them rue the time
When they swept the legs of a child of mine.
