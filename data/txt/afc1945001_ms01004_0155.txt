Mr. Robert Redfield   August 26, 1942

If we finance only the student project, this might leave
(provided we get some appropriation for this type of work) $1,000.
or so from the study of minority group opinion, particularly German,
Italian, Pole and Hungarian, for execution by your people at some
future date. In any case, there will be no financing for the September 
1st starting date suggested in your letter.

I am sorry that this response is so negative. That it is,
is due entirely to the limitation of funds and to the consequent 
necessity of keeping a few first things first.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
