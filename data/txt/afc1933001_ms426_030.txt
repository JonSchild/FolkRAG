THERE'S HOPE FOR AGRICULTURE
Tune--There's Springtime in the Rockies.
Oh, there's hope for Agriculture,
In union there is strength.
There's a brighter day a coming,
And we'll win out fight at length.
There'll be sunshine in the farm home,
But without a sacrifice.
There'll be music round the hearth stone,
When we get an honest price.

There's a flag floats o'er our nation,
It's the red and white and blue,
It has always waved for justice,
To protect both me and you;
It was bought by many battles,
To set the prisoner free,
And 'twill never cease its waving
Till it wins us liberty.

There's a union made of manhood,
And of womankind so real,
'Tis a band of faithful farmers,
What a mighty power they weal.
They will fight to save the farmer,
And make the nation free,
And erect a monumental,
To the Statue Liberty.

STICK TOGETHER
Tune--Moonlight and Roses.
Union together brings possible justice to you,
Co-operation will help make our big dreams come true.
Binding together we'll carry our market plan through,
Fighting together makes brethren of you.

Groaning together our problems grow bigger in size,
Fussing together our courage grows little and dies,
Knocking each other we end up with heartaches and sighs.
Gosh, let's stop kicking for good bye and bye.

Smiling together makes battle grow brighter each day,
Head up together puts black clouds father away.
Hearts bound together in courage that will not decay,
Melted together we'll win out some day.
