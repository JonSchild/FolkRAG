TEAR HITLER DOWN
By Huddie Ledbetter
dictate

Hitler started out in nineteen hundred thirty two,
Hitler started out in nineteen hundred thirty two,
When he started out he took the homes from the Jew.
(wants our homes now)

Chorus: We're gonna tear Hitler down,
We're gonna tear Hitler down,
We're gonna tear Hitler down some day.
We're gonna bring him to the ground,
We're gonna bring him to the ground,
We're gonna bring him to the ground some day.

He says, if God rule Heaven, he gonna rule the world
He says, if God rule Heaven, he gonna rule the world
But we American people say he will be shot down just like a squirrel.

Chorus
Mr. Hitler, we're gonna tear your play house down
Mr. Hitler, we're gonna tear your play house down
You been flying mighty high but you're on your last go-round.

Chorus
The Russians in the east and the [English] Allies in the West,
The Russians in the east and the [English] in the West,
We got you surrounded, Mr. Hitler, boy, we got you best.

Chorus
Russia's by our side and China's fighting too
Russia's by our side and China's fighting too
Tell you, Mr. Hitler, we're easing in on you.

Chorus
The war may be short or the war may be long,
The war may be short or the war may be long,
I don't care how long it lasts, I'm gonna keep on singing this song.
