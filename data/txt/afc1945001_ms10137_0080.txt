1. There were a group of men in a lifeboat after their boat had 
been destroyed and some one said that if three (3) men would 
jump overboard there would be enough room. So a Frenchman 
stood up and said "Long live France" and he jumped over. 
Then an American stood up and said "Long live America" and he 
jumped over. Then a German stood up and said "Long live 
Hitler" and he pushed an Italian overboard.
