Joke
"Calling all Smiths"

A group of ondoners were
huddled together in a shelter
during an air raid. The bombs
were falling at an alarming
rate but one lady, blessed
with a fatalistic philosophy,
turned to a little man beside
her, shurgged.

"It's no use worrying - if my
name's on a bomb, I'll get it."

The little man wasn't impressed.
"That's all very well for you. But
my name is Smith."
