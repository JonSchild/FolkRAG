Easter Wine          Continued

   "What's the matter, papa?" I asked.
   He paused, surprised that we were awake.
   "Sleep, little ones," he whispered, "sleep."
   We wondered. He tip-toed through the flat trying
the doors and windows. And I heard him saying:
   "Who's there? Damnnit who's there? - God - 
damnnit! who's there!!"
   The next day was Good Friday, and cold. I got
up with papa and mama, and sat by papa to have 
some of his hot coffee and fried eggs. As he was
dressing to leave for work I remembered his saying
how freezing and windy it had been on the 
scaffolds all week, so I got my leggings that I had
bought in the Army and Navy store, and suggested
he wear them under his trouser-legs.
   I wrapped the heavy woolen leggings from his
ankles to his knees. He stalked about and said he
felt like a soldier going to war. W-
packing his lunch I filled his corn-
tobacco, and held the match to-

face, picked me up in his fast st-

   "Our smart little American is-

   He gave me his handsome gust-
me down. At the door mama said
ful, "Abide thy step, Geremio, a-
he answered with his nonchalant, -

   I spent the morning helping-
flour, milk, eggs, yeast and spices-
from which would come the hot -
Easter festivities. I aided in the-
rough-formed animals that were-

while mama filled it richly and designed a -
crucifix on the top cover; and I rolled hundreds
of little balls that were to be fried and dipped in 
honey.
   The afternoon was chill, cloudy, and as I was
desperately playing cops and robbers with the
neighborhood kids in a sandlot hidden from the
street by billboards, I heard papa's whistle. It was 
that "Feeerrrr-EE!" no one else could do. I
halted, wondering why he was home so early and
wanting me. No, I thought, it must have been 
someone else who sounded like him, and I went
dashing into the game. Again papa's whistle
came, the long "Feeerrrr-" and the sharp upward
"EE!" I crawled under the billboards and
went out onto the street, but he was not within

sight. Just when I got back with the boys in the 
lot his whistle came longer and sharper. I knew 
it was him. And I went home.
   I found mama taking the big cheese cake out 
of the coal-stove oven, and the kitchen was 
sweetly heavy of baking. Mama put the rich cake
upon the table and contemplated it contentedly. 
She made the sign of the cross over it, kissed it, 
and gazing far far away she began to weep.
   "What are you crying for, mama?" I asked.
   She put her apron up to our eyes.
   "It is now that our Lord Gesu was crucified."
   I felt sorry for our Lord Gesu. I thought. I 
asked mama would He have died since if they had 
not killed Him; and I wanted to know why He 
was not Italian like us.
   She dried her tears and said children should

say anything to them. Downstairs, the street-door
opened. I could feel the draught come through the
space at the bottom of the kitchen door.
   There were people coming. Their movmeent
told me they were paesanos. They stopped in
the vestibule, and slowly began climbing the three
flights. There were men and women, and their
feet touched the stairs with light respectful tread.
It took a long long time for the people to come up.
They paused by the kitchen door. I could not
breathe.
   Mama pressed her head back against the rocker 
and quivered.
   There was a slight low hum of Italian voices,
and a soft resolved tone, and then the door opened.
