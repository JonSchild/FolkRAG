Dear Mr. Lomax,

Your radio program on the "School of the Air", on which 
you sand "Old Dan Tucker" and "Frog he would a wooing go", was 
one of the most thoroughly enjoyable I have heard in a long while.

I am writing to ask you if you have a source list for any 
general subject like Country Dancing or Folk Songs.  I have 
made a very rough shod list, which I'll enclose to save you 
time - in that these things I know of.  What I should especially 
like to know is where to get records of folk music suitable for 
using at square dances.  I have all the Victor records (there are 
only four) and I know of all the Decca albums except Fiddlin Pieces 
(all the other Decca records are made by a very un-countryish 
orchestra.

You must be very busy, and I hope you will not trouble 
personally to acknowledge this.  

One day last summer I called you up while I was in Washington, 
at a time when I was still considering working with Morris Mitchell 
for this year, in making a study of experimental communities in the 
south and their folk culture.  New Haven, however, doesn't 
seem much concerned with folk culture - and so it's useful 
to have your own records and materials to take with you.

Sincerely,
