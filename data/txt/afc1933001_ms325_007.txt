Collier's for August 12, 1939

nodded to him and said, "Hold on. Here 
we go for a dive." 
He shoved the control column for- 
ward, forced the nose of the ship down 
and the engines started barking with the 
acceleration of speed. After a thousand- 
foot plunge he jerked the control back 
and the ship violently snapped out of 
the dive to level flight. They could hear 
the metallic strain on the wing as it gave 
with the snap. They looked at the posi- 
tion indicator. The wheels were still up. 
The jar had failed to release them. 
Back in the cabin there were fourteen 
suddenly bewildered faces. The dive
and the the jar as the ship pulled out 
of it had snapped up every head in the 
cabin. They looked at one another, puz- 
zled looks, and at the stewardess--an 
inquiring look. She forced a smile and 
nodded to each of them and they re-
laxed. If she was smiling it must be all 
right. But what the devil was going on? 
And why was the pilot circling the field 
and climbing higher again? Maybe an- 
other ship was taking off and he wanted 
to get out of the way. 

CARLESON leveled out at five thou- 
sand, made a complete circle, then 
forced the control column forward again. 
He also opened the engines and the 
scream of the propellers to an enor- 
mouse whine as the plane lunged down 
toward the ground. At three thousand 
he snapped the column back and the 
great plane crashed back into level flight 
with a huge groan. The position indi- 
cator still showed UP. 
Carleson said to Benham, "Never
budged 'em. But I darn' near tore off 
the wing. We can't dive any steeper 
than that." 
"No." 
"I'll circle about for ten minutes, then 
try another two-thousand drop. I'd sure 
like to set her down on the wheels." 
"I wonder how the passengers are tak- 
ing it?"
The passengers, this time, were close 
to panic. Their ears are popping and 
their stomachs felt empty and sore from 
snapping out of the dive. They looked 
wildly about and every eye turned to 
Sissy Lewis. 
She smiled and said, "It's nothing im- 
portant, folks. We'll be on the ground
in a few minutes. Please be patient."
They climbed again--to five thousand 
feet--and circled the bowl between the 
two ranges of hills. Benham worked fu- 
riously on the emergency crank and 
even short more oil pressure into the re- 
tracting apparatus. The wheels still re- 
fused to bulge. He sat back and shook 
his head in defeat. 
"Okay," Carleson said. "No use try- 
ing another dive. We've got to land." 
He nosed the ship into a gentle glide, 
holding it to a rate of descent of not 
more than three hundred feet per min- 
ute. Ten minutes later they were within 
fifteen hundred feet of the field and 
spiraling even lower. 
Dr. Reardon looked at his watch and 
leaned tensely back into his seat. It was
already 7:30, 10:30 in New York. The 
body had been found, he had been lo-
cayed and the police were undoubtedly 
waiting for him on the field. So ended 
the career of Dr. Michael Reardon. For 
only a moment he thought of his wife, 
then he straightened his shoulders and 
stared at the blank wall before him. 
J. L. Dubois noted the time and a 
wave of nausea swept over him. The 
meeting was under way, had been for 
the last five minutes. They had prob- 
ably taken away the vote already. He was no 
longer head of the Tri-State Utility Cor- 
poration. Another had displaced him by 
now. Poor chump. 
Mr. Duboi suddenly smiled, then he 
sat upright and positively laughed. Poor 
chump. That expressed it exactly. Now 
he was out of the picture. He could re- 
tire. He could enjoy himself. He could 

be part of the family. Now that it was 
all over he realized what it meant. He 
gave vent to a low whistle of pleasure. 
Stephen St. Claire said to his wife, 
"Prepare yourself for a bad landing, 
darling. Something is wrong." 
"Oh, Steve, do you think..." 
"Nonsense. Just brace yourself, that's 
all. I have a hunch. And, before we 
land, how about your answer? Are you 
coming back with me?" 
Sue held his arm and whispered, "Yes. 
Please forgive me for being a tempera- 
mental food. Please forgive me." 
Stephen nodded and grinned, but he 
was too happy to say anything. 
Carleson came in over the south end 
of the field, fish-tailed the place down 
over the hangars, cleared their tops by 
a few feet and straightened out for the 
landing. The plane settled toward the 
ground and the sirens on the crash wag- 
ons screamed into the air and followed 
down the field after it. The pilot could 
hear them coming and was smiling 
through biting teeth. He eased back on 
the control column and the plane lost 
speed. Only a few feet now. Closer and 
closer. There was the soft dirt. They 
were over it. There was a slight grating 
sound for a second under the body, but 
the air pressure between the wing and 
the ground was still too great to let it 
settle and it lifted a few inches. 
Carleson yelled to Benham, "Hand 
on youngster. Cover your face. Here 
we go." 
He pulled back on the control, the tail 
went down, bit into the soft dirt beyond 
the runways, dragged through it and 
forced the nose down. The bottom of the 
ship touched the ground, at seventy 
miles an hour, a low rumble started,
grew in crescendo until it was a roar 
that seemed to fill the whole earth; then 
there was the snap of the props as they 
bent under, the sparks flying, the cloud 
of dust enveloping everything and the 
ship plunging and bucking through the 
dirt, with Carleson at the wheel fighting 
it, holding it down, now up, keeping the 
wings balanced and off the ground--
there was the danger--fighting it, finally, 
to a halt. 
He had been holding his breath with-
out knowing it, but now he let it out in 
a huge sigh and there were tears in his 
eyes from the strain of the fight. He 
reached down to the floor and jerked on 
the automatic fire extinguisher. The en- 
gines were immediately smothered with 
a chemical to prevent fire. The gas tanks 
had not exploded. The ship was safe on 
the ground. 
Benham said, "Damn' nice work. Al- 
bin, I have never..." 

BACK in the cabin the passengers were 
more bewildered than ever. The stew- 
ardess helped each of them out of the 
door into the arms of the men waiting 
outside. The police took Dr. Reardon. 
Dubois got out grinning like a young kid 
at a picnic. The St. Claires went out 
arm in arm, united again. Mr. Kraft was 
the last to leave. 
"I tell you, young lady," he shouted, 
"I have never experienced such ineffi- 
ciency and never have I seen such rotten 
flying. The nerve of that pilot landing 
us clear out here. Time is important. 
Time..." 
He stepped out the door and own to 
the ground and looked back at the plane. 
It was then that he noticed the wheels 
were still retracted and the ship was 
resting on its belly. It took that fact a 
moment to register, but when it did Mr. 
Albert Kraft fainted. 
Carleson and Benham helped Sissy 
Lewis out of the ship and went off arm 
in arm for a bar. They needed the bar 
immediately and they were arm in arm 
because Sissy could not stand up and 
Carleson didn't think it would look right 
for the field officials to see her that way, 
poor kid. 


"Gee, Mom, Were They All Poor People?" 

"Not exactly poor, Bobby. They had money. But they didn't have 
all the nice things that we have -- a radio, and electric lights, and a 
vacuum cleaner. They didn't have electricity, or automobiles, or air- 
planes. Most of those things hadn't even been invented." 

EVEN as late at 1900, only one American home in every seven had 
a bathtub; one in 13 had a telephone; one home in 30 had elec- 
tric lights. There were only 8000 automobiles. Manufactured prod- 
ucts were scarce and expensive. 

Today there are 20 million bathtubs, 18 million telephones, 22 mil- 
lion wired homes, 25 million automobiles, and millions of other 
manufactured products which were unheard of in 1900 but are now 
plentiful and sell at a fraction of their former costs. 

General Electric scientists and engineers, by applying electrical 
methods to the tasks of industry, have helped to provide us with the 
many products that contribute to our comfort and convenience, and 
to the hundreds of services which we enjoy today. 

G-E research and engineering have saved the public from ten to one hundred 
dollars for every dollar they have earned for General Electric
