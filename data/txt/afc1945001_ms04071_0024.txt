The man in charge of the sale of war bonds in the state of 
North Dakota at Jamestown, North Dakota, on August 7, stated this is one 
of the high ranking states in the Union as far as the purchase of bonds 
is concerned and further they are talking more of our men for the Armed 
Forces per capita than any other state. "The eastern states are not buying 
the bonds even though they have the war industries, nor are they furnishing 
their share of the men for the Armed Services."
