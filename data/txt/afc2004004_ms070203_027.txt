[A] Ye little of birds Erin [has] that's
crossed the [raging sea] Atlantic shore

Yr sweet & gentle music
lies in yr green abode

As we walk for recreation
down to the  the new [Ras] Raskey

I saw thee in this church
last nite bound for Amerikee

I overheard a lady fair
embracing a farmer's son

She says my dearest Johnnie
I fear that I am undone
