BJ: They didn't know what to say. They got to come forward.
Ya see? They didn't know how to bring it up, 'cause you see,
Sister Philip, she go to, she was supposed to be my bosom, an'
she was the only one who stood up by me when I got saved. She
stayed there, you know, untill I come through. But see through
Maggie talk, an' other talk, she just believin' what they say
an' listenin' to them an' lettin' them run 'er. 
All right. Sue Phillip say, "Well, I'll tell ya." She
said, "They been washin' my face..." You know what washin' your face
mean? That mean goin' to ya, talkin' to ya about things. "...Washin'
my face every day about Mother Jones not bein' married to
Brother George," she said, "So I, I, I knowed that this is
'gainst the rule and the law of the Church for it to be done
that way, for them to be together in any Church -- in this
Church -- an' not married. So, so, an' I decided that we would
see about it, see was she married."
So he said "Did you go to Mother Jones?"
Said, "Yes, I went to her."
"So what did she say?"
"She said she was married."
"Well, did she gi' you any kind of proof?"
She say, "Yes." She say, "She show me a duplicate from
Okachokee courthouse." Said, "But I told the peoples about that,
diffrunt ones, that tol' me, that asked me about it." She said,
"An' they tol' me that anybody can write out a duplicate. 'Cause you can
just pick up one from there."
He said, "Where could you get it from?" He asked her.
She said, "I don't know nothin' about it." Said, "They
told me that anybody..."
