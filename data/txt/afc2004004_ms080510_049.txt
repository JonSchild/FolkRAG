of mountain settlement and the rivers were 
clear and the lands were fertile [*\*]  and there 
was a big market for their hogs and they 
were turning the corn that they made into 
wondrous whiskey, that there was an endless 
market for it as well on the frontier and 
on the highways that fed the growing 
frontier so at the beginnings the mountains 
prospered and then as time went on various 
kinds of economic interests moved in and 
the timber began to be cut away and the 
best lands began to be grabbed and coal 
companies came and monopolized all the 
mineral rights and the miners were turned 
into underground slave heroes as we will

prosperity and the land grabs by big 
interests were terrible and so soon the 
whole area was turned into wage slaves. [*\*]   We 
have Ray Hicks and we should have him here 
telling the story about how he worked for 
$1 a day and his father for 50 cents a day 
and his grandfather for 25 cents a day and 
his father for a nickel a day. There is 
that long and bitter history and they had 
to walk, if they were going to be married,
