Davy Faa:
1) There was a wealthy farmer lived in the North country,
He had a lovely daughter who was always frank and free, 
And day by day and night by night she was always in my eye. 

2) So there was a jolly tinker lad came to this farmhouse. 
"It is have you any pots or pans or candlesticks to mend?
Or have you any lodgings for me, a single man?" 
The farmer he thought it nae harm the tinker for to keep,
And the lassie she thought it nae harm the tinker's bed to make.

3) But the tinker followed after her and he did bar the door.
He catched her by the middle small and he laid her on the floor.
He catched her by the middle small and up against a wall,
And it was there he's ta'en the wills of her before she won awa'.

4) The bonnie lassie blushed, and oh she thought shame.
"It's since ye've ta'en the wills o'me, come tell me your name."
He whispered in the xxxxxx lassie's ear, "They call me Davy Faa,
Ad you'll mind upon the happy nicht amongst the pile O'straw."

5) Six weeks had past and gone, this maid grew white and pale,
Nine months and better brought her forth a bonny son.
But since the baby's born, I will call him Davy Faa, 
And I'll mind upon upon the happy night amongst the pile o'straw.

6) For any man who weds my girl, for he'll get lands quite free, 
For any man who weds my girl, for he'll get farms free, 
For although she's lost her maidenhead, o whit the whaur is she.

The Laird of the Dentidoonbye.
1) For a lassie was milking her father's kye, 
A gentleman on horseback he come riding by,
A gentleman on horseback he come ridingby
He was the Laird of the Dentidoonbye.

2) "O lassie, lassie what would you gie,
If I were to lie a nicht wi' thee."
"Tae lie a nicht xxxxxx that'll never, never be, 
Suppose you're Laird of the Dentidoonbye."

3) For he catched her by the middle so small, 
He laid her doon where the grass grew lang.
It was a long, long time till he raised her up again, 
Saying, "You're lady of the Dentidoonbye."
