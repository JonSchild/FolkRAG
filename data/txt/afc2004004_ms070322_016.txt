Saturday - I cut tape all
day, very happily. End of 
day very weary - 1/4 of Irish
album well done. Then went
to big housewarming party at
Isla's where I was jealous
of Robin, unable to talk to 
anyone, sang badly, wanted
to be admired but wasn't,
came home in a fury &
dreampt evil dreams all
night. The Citroen wouldn't
hold the road.
