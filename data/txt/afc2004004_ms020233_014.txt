can stay on that side.  If you got children, be on this side;
your husban', be on this side; an' that side.  Make you git 'em

of rows.  That's the way that go.
TL: Bessie, when did you stop doing this?
BJ: Well, we stopped a long time.
TL: A long time ago?
BJ: Um-hum.  Long time ago.  Ever since my husband died.  Ever
since before he died.  See, I was in, I was in Maryland, you
know, an' ah, I was on that same kinda work.  But I had quit
workin' out in the fields; done work in the factories, about a
year, almost, in Maryland.  So, 'at wa' '48.  Jes' the time I stopped
in '48, the same year he died.  But I still was workin' in, in
the factories.  You see?
[*TOMATOES-IN FIELDS & FACTORIES*]
I would, I would go out in the fields sometime an' pick
ripes.  You know.  Ripe tomatas.
TL: They call 'em ripes, huh?
BJ: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Go out there an' pick them, sometimes.
See, they was, ah, 20 cents a basket, them lil' bit, small
baskets.  Me an' my children go out there sometimes.  There was
so many of 'em, we'd jus' go out there an' pick us [one] a few?
Sometime I pick 'em.  Fer, fer, fer the money they git out, I'd
[they] pick 'em to can.  Put up.  Ya can put up many as ya want.
It's up to you, 'cause they out there rottenin', ripe ones.
An' ya pick 'em an' carry 'em to the factory, ya know, to sell.
I mean, you know, for money.  Then [the people at] they take 'em to the factory, an'
they make tomata juice an' tomata paste.  See.  So after I work
in the factory, sometime the factory don't be runnin' that
day or sumpthin' that we can pick a lot a ripes an' put in there.
