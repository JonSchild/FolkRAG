Miss Gertrude Zwenig
1085 Anderson Ave.
Bronx, New York

Dear Miss Zwenig:

In reply to your recent letter, I wish to
state that no job is open in the Archie of American
Folk Song at present. I'm sure your interest and experience
would be useful and I suggest that if you
wish to apply for such a position as suggested in your
letter in the future, you write to Mr. Rogers, Personnel
Director, in charge of applications.

I'm glad to know that someone enjoyed the
classes at New York University as much as I did.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
