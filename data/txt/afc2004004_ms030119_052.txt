are like.  What you've experienced.)
     NOW.  You can always tell em, you know, that a boy's
not good to deal with.  (he sniffles and knocks out his pipe,
and during this interview, as in the others, he hawks and spits
continuously)  You can always tell me that boys is not good to deal
with.  An you catch em, you understand, in company of boys, git you
a switch. Let your switch do more talkin than your tongue.  Girls
should be kept very, very close an tight.  Until they git to a 
certain age.
     (When can you turn them loose?)
      when ever you can be able to ask them a
question that they can be able to answer.  The question you ask em:
"Now listen, if I low you a chance to enjoy yo'sef, will you be a
good girl an keep yo dress down?  Don't low no boys to ask you
no questions like that?  If they ask you, tell em no?  Will yo u
be able to do that?  If you can't, I think I have to keep you in.
     (Then if they said "Yes" could you let them go out?)
      Try em a little bit.
     (Where would you let them go?)
     Where would I let em go?  Well, wheresomeever they ask
yo u to let em go.  Yo u see to it yosef that it be a nice place.
Some people of your n eighbors that you know.  Sometimes your
chile git ruint among your neighbors, it's true. But if you
got any friends, they gon hep you br ing that chile up.  You can't 
br ing a chile up by yosef.  You can't raise a chile by yosef.
You can birth it by yosef, but you can't raise it by yosef.
     (You have to have somebody h elp you birth it.)
     Thass what I'm tryin to tell you now.  You took that out
of my mouth.  You can't even birth it by yosef.  You even got to have
somebody else to hep you git it!  (we laugh)
