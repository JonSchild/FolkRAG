WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON?

There's a great and bloody fight round the whole wide world tonight.
In the battle the bombs and shrapnel rain
Hitler told the world around, he would break our freedoms down,
United Nations gonna break those slavery chains, Great God!
United Nations gonna break those slavery chains.

I walked up on a mountain in the middle of the sky
I could see every farm and every town
I could see all the people in this whole wide world
That's the union that'll tear old Hitler down, down, down!
That's the union that'll tear old Hitler down.

When I think of the men and the ships going down
And the Stalingrad, the fortress on the Don
London in ruins and Paris in chains
Good people, what are we waiting on?
Good people, what are we waiting on?

So I thank the Soviets and the mighty Chinese vets
And the Allies this whole wide world around
To the battling British- Thanks! You can have ten million Yanks
If you need them to tear old Hitler down! Great God!!
If you need them to tear old Hitler down!
