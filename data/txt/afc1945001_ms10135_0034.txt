College Freshman
Negro - Female

I. I often wonder about the ending of the war
Just what conditions, we as Negroes will
stand. To me I feel great changes for a 
new democracy.
Joke: 
Just why does the boys join the navy?
Ans: To ride the W.A.V.E.S.

II. The war to-day changes habit patter for
most boys in the camps. Those who 
never smoke or drink think now
there is nothing more fitting as to "big
time" on their furlough.
III. It was not because I wanted to be a
selfish child. I dread very much in
giving up my toys I had saved from
a younger child to give to Uncle Sam
for scraps.
