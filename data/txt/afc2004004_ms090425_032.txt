Fisk, 21. 5,

Rock me, Shake Me.

(Manuel Casey)

You better mind, oh, sister,
How you walk on the cross.
Put in your slipper,
Or your soul be lost.

Rock me, Lawdy,
Shake me, Lawdy.
Don't let me sleep
Until too late.
Gabriel gonna sound his silver trumpet
In the mornin
Gonna swing on the Golden Gate.

Well, Sampson burntdown the fields of corn.
Well, they looked for Sampson,
But he was gone.
Well, found old Sampson dead three or four days,
They took and bound his hadns, his feet with rope.
While walking along, he seen
An ojo born,
Just moved his hands,
The rope popped like thread,
You got the hand 'fore thousands were dead,
Crying,

Rockme, Lawdy,
Shake me, Lawdy.
Don't let me sleep
Until too late.
Gabriel gonna sound his silver trumpet
In the mornin.
Gonna swing on the Golden Gate.
