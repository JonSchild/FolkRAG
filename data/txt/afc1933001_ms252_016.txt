Dear Father:
     The blanks and needles for you were shipped today. Next
time you are going to need anything, try to wire us in advance
so that we won't have to keep you waiting
     Miss Rogers has not been in the least involved in the delay 
of your payment.
     I would be personally very much embarrassed, and I think
it would be an affront direct, if you deposited your valuable
folklore manuscripts anywhere else but in the Archive of American
Folk Song. It would seem an expression of lack of belief on 
your part in the Archive which you have created. While Harvard
certainly helped you in the early part of your career, there
is no question that the Library of Congress ultimately did very
much more to make your work known and make you appreciated. I 
know of your recent unpleasantness about fiscal matters, but
the Library as such is not responsible for that. It's been a 
matter of pure administrative mixups due to the natural changes 
that took place when Dr. Putnam retired and a new man stepped
in to fill his shoes.
     I think you might discuss with Dr. Spivacke your obligation
to Harvard and inquire whether the Library would be willing
to photostat your manuscripts and give a photostatic copy to 
the Harvard Library.

                             Love,
