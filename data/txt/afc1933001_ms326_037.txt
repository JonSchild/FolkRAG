THE LITERATURE OF JAZZ
  Believing that a great many collectors are interested as well
as collecting the literature of jazz, we are now in a position to
offer a few items of interest -- mostly magazine articles and a book
or two. At present, we are getting together a stock of items on jazz
music. If interest warrants it, a cataologue will be issued later.
Your reactions to this venture will be appreciated.

AT LAST -- A REAL JAZZ PUBLICATION!
  We are glad to 'plug[?] Jazz Information, the weekly paper which
is devoted exclusively to hot music. Since its inception several months ago,
Jazz Information has been a hit.[xx] It is of especial interest to collectors,
since its collectors' column is a regular feature. Those of you who don t
subscribe can do so by sending [xx] $3 for a one -year subscription to
Jazz Information, Suite 900 B, 505 Fifth Avenue, New York City. You can
get four issues for two bits, four months for $1, or six months for $1.50.

The first page of this catalogue is dated November 25th[?]. Actually I
was unable to finish it until December 8th In case you were worried.
