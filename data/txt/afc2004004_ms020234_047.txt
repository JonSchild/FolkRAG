BJ TAPE 20, p. 44

TL:     Did he like that?
BJ:     Oh, ye-ah.  I was up talkin' -- He [liked] liketed -- He tol'
me on his dyin' bed, he was glad of it that. . .they know he, said,
I, I was the cause of him to be uplifted to the sky.   That was fair
enough.   Hah, that was fair enough!  You know I [mean] feel good
about that.   An' [then] yet alive.   An' then [alive] yet!  I feel good about
it.   Yessir.  He tol' me that same day he passed away.
[*BJ'S WORKING, GEN'L.*]
         He passed away so easily. . .Passed away on easy.   Yes, he did.
TL:     Well, have you worked all your life?
BJ:     Worked all my life?
TL:     Yeah, always had a job?
BJ:     Oh, yeah. . .
TL:     For ever and ever and ever?
BJ:     Um-hum. . .'Cause I, I could work when I wasn't workin'.   You
know, tha's all.   Then, when I wasn't workin', I didn't have to 
work, you know what I mean?   Like when I stayed in Maryland?   Ah,
ah, in the, in the, time when I, you know, when[there] they wasn' workin'?
I had restored (?) an' enough junk back in the house there for me
to last me a month                a long time, see?   If I didn't wanna
go out an' do some factory work.   There's plen'y a factory work.
There's chicken factories an' things aroun' there goin' on all the
time.   But I didn't never have to work in one.  I would go sometime
in there [to] an' see how it's done an' like that an'. . .wit' friends
I knowed an' like that.   But I never did have to if I didn't have
to do it.   See, I save [a nickle tooth] a nickle[, toe] or two back
an', an' I always had a way, somehow or nother, to live.
       'Cause I've known peoples to (share with snow?) to come to
come to my house an' bring food; I wasn't lookin' for 'em.   Wasn'
expectin' 'em.   So, it jest be that way.   Sit here an' go here
