of brother Gus. You, now brother Gus
is studying to be a preacher soon
in Baylor Community; and some
of you have heard him preach
until long past dinner-time on
a hot August Sunday. You
know and I know that Gus
is a good boy and ain't much
of a preacher. Somebody has
made a mistake, my brother,
and I have come here to tell
you how it happened:
The Lord called me to preach
and Gus answered:
"Shouts of merriment greet us
this rally. Andy sternly rebuked
this afterward and went on to describe
the dwelling of the damned

"Hell is deep and Hell is wide
Hell ain't got no bottom or side

And you are on your way there," shouted
Andy, "unless you quit doing what
you have been doing"
