Dear Alan:
First, to answer your question relative to the Rosenwald Project. Indications 
are that I will be able to devote considerable time to the Project, since registration 
of the College is much less now than in former years; therefore, I could devote practically 
any afternoon, all Saturday, and Sunday to the work, with the possibility that even more 
time might be given to it on occasions by arrangement with President Garrett--whom I 
think would be sympathetic with the plan. Let us say that I could average at least 
Saturday and Sunday and two afternoons per week in the field and do the other work, 
transcribing, etc., at other times, evenings and spare moments. You might be able to 
figure roughly how many records might be needed with this much time available, but 
certainly three or four hundred, provided subjects worth while are found. I feel sure 
that the College Administration will be in sympathy with the movement and would cooperate 
by seeing that I had time to do it. You know the field here is rich for no one 
can perdict exactly what may be found.
Perhaps I should mention it here that transportation problems will be a factor 
but by June 1943 things may be better in the rubber line, as I think now they will let 
teachers be allowed recaps, and if this work should be regarded in that category 
that problem will be solved. I think it probably well not to cross that bridge at 
this time.
The matter of a recorder, perhaps with a battery set is also a factor, but 
suppose you have that in mind. It might be possible to use the College recorder, 
but, of course, permission would have to be obtained for this purpose.
In regard to the duplicate Zema Hill's records, let me say, that I only wish 
one disk, two sides, of the sermon. The sermon runs longer than this, but there is 
no use of running it all. I took samples of about one minute each from several portions 
of the sermon. If this could be done it would be satisfactory.
We are all wuite well now, but Ruth has had pleurisy during the past month. I 
am back at work and I am quite busy until things settle into their groove. We remember 
your visit as one of the pleasant events of our summer , and wish you could come back 
and stay longer.
Our most sincere good wishes for immediate future , especially if this includes 
some service in the army.
Yours truly,
John Vincent

P. S. In a few days I am going to send you a card, asking that you look up some material 
for my "Folk Passion". One movement is already complete and an initial private performance 
convinced me that this is the strongest work I have yet done.
