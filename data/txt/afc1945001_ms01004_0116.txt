Relationship Between this Study and Whatever 
National Picture May be Drawn from Data Collected 
by the Various Field Staffs
Rumors are to be collected during the week of August 3rd by the
various field staffs on a national scale; the results of this 
study should be of considerable value in allowing a deeper 
interpretation of the total rumor situation. Obviously the 
extension of the results of this study must be made with great 
care, but it is believed that the psychological insights which 
are anticipated will more than justify such an attempt.
