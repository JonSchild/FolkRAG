New York -- Swedish fishermen have been supplying German
submarines off New Jersey.
These occur in all coastal areas.
Colorado -- Two saboteurs were caught putting explosives in
the cement of the Pueblo Ordinance Depot.
New York -- The boy yodeler formerly on the Philadelphia
Scrapples program is really much older (although dwarfed) and
he was giving information to the enemy through his patriotic
songs.
Illinois -- A German girl (sometimes Italian) working in a
local factory making gas masks is alleged to have been caught
puncturing all gas masks as they passed her. She had her
finger bandaged and under the bandage she had a needle used
for this purpose.
These stories are present all over the country, but are
found with particular frequency in the South and New England.

Atrocity stories -- tongue and stamp
Oklahoma -- An American mother received a letter from her son
in a Japanese prison camp. He said he was being treated very
well and asked her to save the stamp for his collection.
Underneath it his mother found written, "They have cut out my
tongue."
There are varying versions of this story. The letter is
received by a father or a wife, and the message sometimes
reads, "they are starving us" or "they have cut off my ears"
or "they have pierced my eyes".

Other Atrocity Stories
Minnesota -- An American mother wrote her son to get a Jap
and send her his eyes. After a while she received a box
parcel post from Japan and in it were the eyes of her son.
California -- The Japs are not keeping any prisoners, but
shoot all except those which can be useful.
Alabama --20% of our men in the Service are killed on
maneuvers and 5% of these have their eyes pierced out by
Nazi and Jap agents in Louisiana.
These are notably few, distributed thinly over the
entire country.
