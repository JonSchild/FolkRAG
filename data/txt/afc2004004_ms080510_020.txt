MAN [*02 : 05 : 15 : 07*]
  Well Stanley was went on to tell me
for example the story of the Black
Bull of Norway which was one of the
great epic dramas of Norseland.  He
had saved that up for me, that was
the next thing he did and then he
took me in the kitchen and gave me a 
drink of the best mountain liquor I
had ever had in my life, in fact I
used, when I was working that area I
used to drive about 60 or 70 miles
to go back to have another drink of
it, it was smooth and firey as love.

Well, he and I do everything,
Stanley did, he lost some of his
teeth so we put some of the stuff up
here in, what do you call it, we put
some captions up here so won't miss
a single jewelled phrase of Stanley
because everything he did is pure
the mountain spring water.  He makes
dulcimers, he carves hundreds of
different kinds of toys, he has
every kind of story you can think of
