Bernardsville, N. J.

Dear Mr. Allan-Allen:

I am sorry that I'll not be in Washington between the 
25 of December and January 1, but I hope it will be possible 
to arrange to meet somewhere at some time.  I think, perhaps,
you'll enjoy hearing the folksongs in the Archive of American
Folk Song in the Library of Congress and I'd like to make whatever 
suggestions I could, if I may be so helpful, for program
material.  Meantime, if you have any material for singing groups, 
I'd like to hear about it.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
