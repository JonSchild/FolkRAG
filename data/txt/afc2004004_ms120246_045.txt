There is a certain little bag that can protect
you from any wanga - if you have it on
you -

One day R. sat nodding - say a man
put a wanga on the road - he went
opened the package - put the 37¢ in his
pocket, tied the black handkerchief around
his neck, put the dagger in his belt,
threw the other things in the fire -
next morning fried the 2 eggs in
[the fire] & bought biscuit with
the 37¢ to eat with the eggs -

If a family makes $50 a year, they are
likely to spend $20 on Voudeu -
