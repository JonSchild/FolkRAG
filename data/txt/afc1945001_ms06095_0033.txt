In eight different quarters we have been told that Detroit
definitely will be bombed this summer. These reports are usually prefaced
with "Several people I know in the Detroit defense services tell me."   In
this connection a drafting engineer at the Ford plant heard from "someone"
at the plant August 5 that the guards at the plant were to be tripled and
armed with sub-machine guns in anticipation of an enemy air raid within
eight weeks.   [*Michigan  9   (Aug 3-8)*]
