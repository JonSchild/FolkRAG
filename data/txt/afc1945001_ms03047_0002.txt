From:  Vlad F. Ratay, Regional Research Consultant
Social Security Board, Region XII.

Subject:  Study of rumors.

The Regional Director's Office in San Francisco 
requested me to be one of the ten persons selected
to report on rumors heard during the week ended 
August 8.  During that period I was in travel 
status and had very little opportunity to hear 
this type of conversation. 

This is the only "rumor" I heard and 
according to instructions am reporting it 
to you. -
