6) So uncou' sweir I took them off the lassie for to please,
But aye my breeks they birkit up around my knees.
A rat gaed crawling up my leg in the middle of the psalms,
Never again will I ride the kirk without my nicky tams.

My Ain Hoose:
1) This is no my ain hoose, my ain hoose, my ain hoose,
This is no my ain hoose, I ken by the biggin o't.
Bread and cakes and my dour cheeks, my dour cheeks, my dour cheeks,
Bread and cakes and my dour cheeks and pancakes the biggin' o't
This is no my ain hoose, mu ain hoose, my ain hoose,
This is n my ain hoose, I ken by the biggin ost.
2) This is no way my ain wain, my ain wain, my ain wain,
This is no my sin wain, I ken by the greetie o't.
I'll take my kerchie off my head, off my head, off my head,
I'll take my kerchie off my head and wrap't aboot the feetie o't

The jealous Love of Queen Maive:
The tale of the jealous love of Queen Maive
For Freucht son of Friacht of the keen-edged blade.
Came love's sickness fell, fell to Maive the Queen of our flowing horns.
Straight on the heel of her desire; and search till I have
full palms of rowanberries from the cold pool.
If only they be pulled by Freucht.
Lay the monster in the cold pool, deep sleeping by the cluster of rowanberries. . . . 
Yet safe pulled he the fruit for Maive, the son of Friacht of the keen-edged blade.
Another bunch still craved the Queen and out upon the quest went Friuvht -
O the grief o' me - the breast of his fair white skin.
She tore his fair white breast till wounded. . . .
Came Maive's daughter of the white palms, fresh maid of the golden yellow hair,
The cry of a friend by the burial cavern, the keening low of women.
The tale of the love of the daughter of Maive, for Freucht son
of Friacht of the keen-edged blades. . . . .

This is a translation from the Gaelic by Alistair McMaster
Alistair, the greatest of the Gaelic bards of the 18th century,
and it's just as well known in English as in Gaelic. I found it
in Argyllshire from a fisherman who was the great-grandson of a 
bard called Sandy Grant.
