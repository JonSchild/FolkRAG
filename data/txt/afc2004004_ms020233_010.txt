BJ TAPE 19, p. 8

you got to dump into a sack.  Ya see.  I didn' understan' that.
I picked...I reached down an' caught that thing, them green
potatoes?  I said... Then I looked across the field an' see my husband
out there drivin' a truck.  I said, "Oh, no.  He don't want
me."  Said, "I'm leavin' here.  Him an' all."  I was so...Oh, I
was so...An'...
TL:  So you tried to pick up these potatoes and it was just too
much?
BJ:  It was too much for me.
TL:  What was the trouble?  Was it because it was too heav[e]y or
because you just didn't know how to pick it up?
BJ:  It was too heavy.  I didn't know how to pick it up
And then, it was too heavy.
TL:  When did you find out?
BJ:  Aw, a girl showed me.  Another girl, she showed me.  A
lil' later on.  How to use the sling of it.
TL:  The what?
BJ:  How to use it to pull it up, ya know?
TL:  How do you do that?
BJ:  Well, there's jus', jus' a way ya have to lif' it up.  Keep
from strainin' ya insides, ya know?
TL:  How do you do it, Bessie?  Can you describe what you do?
BJ:  Well.  Ya jus' pick it up on you, on your knee kinda like.
Let it come up to ya knee, then tilt it over.  An' it go on the
other side a ya.
TL:  You get right on the ground, actually?
BJ:  No.  Jus' kinda squat a lil' bit an' let it come, jus' bring
it up to ya knee.  It's a easier way she showed me how to do it.
Not easy, but it's better.  Ain't nothin' easy 'bout pickin' up
