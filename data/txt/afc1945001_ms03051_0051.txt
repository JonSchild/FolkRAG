We talked to Mr. Penland personally and his industrial
research men on October 5 prior to writing him a confidential
letter and sending him a self-addressed franked envelope.
At the time of our conversation it seemed that both understood
thoroughly what we wanted but were reluctant to undertake 
the job.

Dear Mrs. Miles:

I am afraid I cannot be of much help to you with reference to
the matter contained in your letter of October 5.


I have had absolutely no discussion of any of the subjects
named except that of racial relations, and you are fully familiar
with the rumors which were going the rounds in Memphis the early
part of this week.

I will keep this matter in mind and if I run across something
relating to the subjects you mention, I will be glad to communicate
with you.

Sincerely yours,
Clifford Penland
Executive Secretary
