WILLIAM, WILLIAM TRIMBLETOE
A counting rhyme

William, William Trimbletoe,
He's a good policeman to catch them hens,
Put 'em in a pen,
Some lays eggs and some don't.

Wire, briar, lemon, lock,
Sit and sing to twelve o'clock,
The clock fell down,
The mice went 'round,
And Y-O-U-T spells "out."
Old man Chatman's house.

I wend downtown the other day,
I met my brother Jim,
He had a hammer and he had a nail
And he had a cat with thirty-nine tails,
Some to the east and some to the west,
Some to the evers goo goo nest.
