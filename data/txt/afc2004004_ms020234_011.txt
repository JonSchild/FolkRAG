BJ TAPE 20, p.8

BJ:    Makin' it...Um-hum...An' so we sit there an' had lot a fun.
Den that was fun to me.  An' so, well, after one or two o'clock,
ya know.  So I wouldn't go home, I stayed out there.
        An' boy, [an'] 'at next day she was looking for me!  "Is
?"
         I says, "I thought y'all wasn't talkin'.   I was go where
peoples talkin' at."   Ha, ha, ha, ha!   That was funny. Ha, ha, heh, heh! An' so,
she did never did say nothin'...Never did say nothin' about it.
         An' so.  One day I wanted her to know how it was 'cause I
didn't know what Rosalie had tol' her.  You know, my daughter.
So one day I wanted to know how it was, and ah, so Ollie an',
an', it wa' Ollie an' Willie an' Miss Nancy.  All of 'em was
down there.  We was all laughin' an' talkin', jus diffrunt
things, about chirrun.  I got my little chance to come in there.
Then I tol' 'em about Rosalie, how she did that day out in the lot.
        Rosalie was settin' right there.  I said, "An' I jus' had 
ta whup 'er."  Ha!  So, I said, " 'Cause she was jus' gonna take
that corn out there, just anyhow, see?   I just had to give her
a good, a good whippin'."
         An'                           said, "You sure done right, 'cause
she'd a-did that, she'd a-kept on bossin' you an' kep' on."  An',
ah, an' so...I ain' heard no more about it.  I ain' heard a nother
word about it at all.  They knew the wust of it.
          I got a chance to tell 'em without any, you know, words.
'Cause I don't have no words with my parents, [an' so] you know?  An' it was
funny to me;  I got a chance to tell 'em.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Just 
how it was.  'Cause I didn' know how Rosalie had tol' 'em. [ya 
know.]  But that was funny.
           But, [ol' Ma] oh my, she was up to it.  An' she...
TL:       That's a great story.
