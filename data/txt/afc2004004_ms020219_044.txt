         "Won' gi'm (give them) much."   Catch his eye back there
at Bertha.   Said, "Bertha?"
         "Well, I mus' git out 'cause I don't [thing] drink at all;
I don't want any at all."   You know, she was jes', jes' was funny-
actin' way she act.
         Said, "Bertha, I want you to taste this.   This so-o good."
He kept on an' he beg 'er. Said, "Bertha, taste a lil' bit."
         Sayd, "No, I cain't.   I ain't gonna taste a bit of it.   I
don't want none of it.   I ain't gonna taste it."
         "Well, ya drink, Bertha."   She did drink, ya know.   "Why
wontcha drink wi' me?"   See?   Heaheard somethin'
'Cause                         she, she drink, ya know.   We all drink.
We all, jus' around there.   We all drink in that time.   So,
sumpin' or other she musta had said about [you know] it, she not
drinkin', you know, or sumpin'.   But anyhow, he said, "Well,"
he said, "Then nobody gonna get a chance to get off an' catch

         Bertha said, "Well," said, "I don't want none.   I just
don't want none."   There's something had been said.   I -- Lawd,
I wanted to tell 'er to take a drink, but I know she didn't
care about to talkin' to none of us                 We was
too little cats to say any thing to her about it.   Didn't try

         So, anyhow, he kep' on.   The train blowed, from the station.
         Miss Ross said, "Mist' Williams, we got to go.   Give us
our money..."
         Well, Bertha will jus' ha' to take a drink."   An' he
started to git up.   Ya know, he can't git up, ya know, he got
to wiggle when he go to get up an'          an'       .
