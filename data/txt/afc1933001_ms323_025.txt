FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA "SMOKIES"

Authentic, Valid and "Sure Enough Good Fun"

For the King and Queen of England, during their American visit in June 1939, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt presented at the White House, "A Program of American Music." Bascom Lamar Lunsford and The Soco Gap Folk Artists were invited to share the program with Lawrence Tibbett, Marion Anderson, Kate Smith, and others.

"Better than Broadway"

"It was hard for me to decide which numbers pleased me most, since all were so good in their line. - - - -- -

"After the show was over, I went back stage to tell the artists that I had enjoyed their program better than anything I had seen on Broadway. - - - - - 

"It is impossible to estimate the value of such an entertainment in the development of appreciation of the native arts." - - - - -

"Sure Enough Good Fun"

"Things speeded up when the North Carolina Mountaineers flocked onto the new Auditorium and Community Center's vast stage (St. Louis, to swing the songs and dance the dances that have been handed down for generations in the villages and on the rocky farms of the lower Appalachias.


Buck and wing and clog-dancing are sure enough good fun and so are square dances, and when a hard worker like Sam Queen of Soco Gap is caller, 'Ocean Wave,' and 'circle' and 'Georgey Rang-Tang' come thick and fast and a fellow has to step right along or he won't be where his 'lady partner' is scheduled to meet him next.

. . . "There's a Grand Evening Ahead"

"The amount of ignorance in the U. S. concerning folk dancing is appalling. We know all about pseudo Russian dancing, hypothetical rhumbas from 'Sloppy Joes's, in Havana, and dubious jotas from Seville (made in Toledo, Ohio), but few of us know anything about our American folk-art.

"Speaking as one who has judged these people and other native dancers, at White Top, Va., I can truthfully say that the Soco Gap (and Soco Gap does not mean Standard Oil, or any variant of Socony) Folk Dancers are among the best and that they are 'great fun,' and by fun, I mean they are exhilarating.

"I don't mind our being snooty (there's another and similar word substituting for that) about art, but I mind a deal about our being dumb and unaware about our folk background--aye, and fore-ground, and with the Soco Gap coming to show us, some of us feel we are going two steps forward in going one step backward.

"So dos ce dos - - - as the shouters shout, and there's a grand evening ahead."
