My dear Mr. Lomax, 

Your note of May 30 reached me this morning in New York. I had a talk yesterday afternoon with Mr. Garwick. He showed me photographs of the machine he proposes to build. His promises sound rather hopeful, and I trust he will realize them. I am to get the specifications within a day or two. Meanwhile, I have told him that we definitely want him to build us a machine and he assured me that he would lose no time. However, even with the utmost speed, it will probably take at least two weeks to have the machine in readiness. Then their remains the shipping of it to Texas, which will probably mean another three or four days. There-fore, it might be safe to say that the machine cannot possibly be in your hands for another three weeks.

Your note still fails to disclose whether the forwarding address given in it is also the one to which you would want the machine expressed.

Faithfully yours, 

Chief, Division of Music
