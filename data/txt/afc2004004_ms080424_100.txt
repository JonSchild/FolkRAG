Roll 63  Stan Hicks  3
(Stan) and (unint.) got her in the nursing home, and it's pretty hard
to get any help.  And my mother, she fell and broke her hip, she's
in the hospital awhile, and she's in the nurses home now.  And my
brother, he stepped on a 'tater digger, that one lookin' in his
picture over there, and it flew up and cut his head open.  So he had
to have that sewed back.  And my younger brother that preaches, he
don't no more, he's in the service. So he went to get in a soldier's
home, so they sent him back and he took too much dope, and he 'bout
went crazy.  He's in (unint.) hospital now.
AL:  But the real problem is that you can't get any response out of
Medicaid.
Stan:  No, can't get nothing, they just put me off, kept putting us off.
We spent everything we had, had a little saved up.  We've gotten
(unint) this month.  If we don't get something I'm gonna have to bring
her back home.  So that's it, you can't get nothing around here much.
AL:  What they charging you?
Stan:  They're charging me $1320/month to keep her in there, and then the
medicine's about $150 - $180.  And they let loose her  top teeth, so I
had to get some of them made, my son just went over there yesterday nad
paid for them, that's $280.
AL:  Well, where are your teeth then, why don't you have some teeth in
there?
Stan:  Well, I'd have some, but too much money, don't have that kind of
money to do it with.  They want $500 to pull these out and put the
other ones in, I don't have that kind of money, so I just have to gum
it.  I've got these jaws over here wore into the bone, and I can cut
it just like a knife. .  You know, it'll go by one, cut it open then
