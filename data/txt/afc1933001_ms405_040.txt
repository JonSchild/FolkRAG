                                    GEORGIA LAND

   This song is what is known as a sinful reel.  In the cool of the evening when a man has nearly finished his plowing, or late Saturday night rattling home from town with a jug under the wagon seat and the lines tied to the handbrake--these are occasions for "Georgia Land."  We have heard it all over the South on the lips of rural Negroes, but the stanza to which we cling still is the following:
                     Last year' was a very fine year
                     For termaters and pertaters.
                     Papa didn' raise no beans an' greens
                     But, Lawd God, them  'taters!

                                                    THE DODGER

   Mrs. Emma Dusenberry of Mena, Arkansas, sings  "The Dodger."
She learned it in the 1880's, when a farmer could still make a living,
" Just as sure as he was born."
