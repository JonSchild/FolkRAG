Dear Mr. Lomax:

I appreciated your letter very much. Of course, I have always
known that I have your friendship and good will. Our pleasant associations
in the past, and our mutual interest in Western lore and ballads
give us a great deal in common. It's too bad we don't live nearer
each other, so that we could visit once in a while. I always enjoyed
our too rare chats, when you stopped in at the office. It just occurred
to me, in casting about for some solution of my present difficulties,
that you might be in a position to put me on to something, and so I
did not have any hesitation in writing to you.

I do not consider that you are or ever have been under any
obligation to me. You were most generous in allowing the use of
material from your anthologies in the old Song Corral, and it was
by way of making the transaction slightly remunerative to you that
I was glad to purchase the little stories behind the songs. These items
were well worth the small amount that my editorial budget permitted
me to pay for them.

It is too bad that the present editor of WILD WEST WEEKLY has
dropped the Song Corral. It was a means of bringing to light many
interesting bits of Western folklore and cowboy balladry -- the most
worth-while feature in the whole publication, in my opinion.

It was nice to hear from you. I hope you are keeping in good health,
and enjoying life these days, in so far as enjoyment of life is possible
in these troubled times.

With all good wishes and kind remembrances,
Sincerely yours, Ronald Oliphant.
