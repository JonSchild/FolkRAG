THE WHITE HOUSE

March 7, 1941

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Just before leaving Washington
 yesterday, Mrs. Roosevelt asked me to acknowledge
 and thank you for your letter of February 
twenty-eighth. She appreciates your
 courtesy in letting her have the statement
 which you enclosed, together with the check
 for the unexpended sum of money.

Very sincerely yours,

Ralph W. Magee

Administrative Officer,
