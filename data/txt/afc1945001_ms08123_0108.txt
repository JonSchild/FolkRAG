A soldier had a horse in the 
sandy part of a censored place.
There were mosquitos with beaks
a foot long.  The horse was stand-
ing out eating when a swarm
of mosquitoes came up to him.
The soldier had turned to go
into a tent, on returning he
did not see the horses. Only
the spot in here he had stood.
On going to the spot, Mr. Sol-
dier saw only the giant mos-
quitoes pitching horse shoes to 
see which one would have
the poor horses bones.
