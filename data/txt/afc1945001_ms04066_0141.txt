            "When they rounded up the Japs, they got in the locker of one 
Jap who had been a mechanic for the S. P. (Southern Pacific Railroad) for 
20 years. He had all kinds of maps. I know this for a fact because I saw 
the maps. They were all done in Japanese letters and it would take a 
translator to make anything out of them, but he was one alright. No doubt 
about it. Smart devil, too. Couldn't understand English, except when he 
wanted to. They asked him, 'Are you for Japan or the United States?' .. 
'No savvy.' .. 'Do you want the United States to win the war?' He said 
'Ya, Ya.', but he wasn't very enthusiastic about it. They've taken all 
those birds off the railroad now."  [*Salt Lake City, Utah*] [*21*] [*8-5*]
