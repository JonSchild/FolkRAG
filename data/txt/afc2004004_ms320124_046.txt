BARRY ANCELET   -45
Cajuns are sort of, the Cajun country was a sort of a 
melting pot of its own.  Cultures came here, people,
different kind of people from all over came here.
Americans, Germans, Spanish, Irish, Scotch.
LOMAX  And the, and Indians here, too,
no, American Indians?
ANCELET  They were, there were very few
Indians when the Arcadians came.  By the time the Arcadians
got out to the prairies there were very, very few.  There
were the [Homa] Indians.  There were the [Chitmocha]
Indians, the Arcadians had some interaction. . .
:  [INAUDIBLE]
ANCELET  They had, the Aarcadians had in,
interaction with, along the [Bayou Tesh], the Chitimochas,
the [UNCLEAR].  And all of these people sort of cooked in
the same pot.
:  Yeah.
ANCELET  And it's kind of like when you
make a gumbo, you know.  You put in water, if you boil some
water and some onions just by themselves it won't taste very
good.  But you put in bell peppers and celery and chicken,
and maybe some sausage and salt and pepper, and [arue]
and. . .
