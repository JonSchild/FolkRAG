he never had got nothin' on [Bill] him.  An' he liked him.  
So he looked at Bill Martin an' 'gin to think what he's 
gonna tell him.

L.B. Sings:  Bill Martin wring his han's an' he started to cryin'.  
Judge said, "I won' hang you , but I'll give you life-time."
[*repeat*]

L.B. Speaks:  The judge looked at Bill Martin an' he 'gin to talk to him----

L.B. Sings:  "Think about your dirty deed---
Cold-blooded- murderin' the po' girl, Ella Speed."
[*repeat*]

L.B. Speaks:  Bill Martin was an['] awful good gambler.  A good coon-can 
player an' dealer of monte.  He sit down after de judge 
give him life-time an' he fouled his hand.

L.B. Sings:  Bill Martin sat down to play coon-can,
Po' boy couldn' half play his han', 
Thinkin' 'bout de woman that he murdered, 
had gone away to some far, [distaunt] distant lan'.

L.B. Speaks:  They taken Bill Martin out de jail to de freight depot-- 
where they gonna bring his po' wife's dead body by-- so 
he could look at her.  See what a low-down deed he had done.  

L.B. Sings:  They taken Bill Martin to de freight depot,
The train come on [esin' by] easin' by; 
Waved his han' at de woman that he murdered,
Po' boy hung down his head an' he cry.

"She's gone, she's gone , she's gone,
An' cryin' won' bring her back [?].
She's the onlies' woman dat I ever loved.
She's gone down some lonesome railroad track."

De women all heard dat Ella Speed was dead,
They all went home an' they reragged in red.
[*repeat*]

They taken Ella Speed to the buryin' groun', 
They was all singin' wid a doneful soun'.
[*repeat*]

Twas on the twenty-sixth day of December,
Bill Martin said, "I will always remember."
[*repeat*]

The last word that Bill Martin said, 
"Po' girl, Ella Speed, Lawd, she is dead."
[*repeat*]

"I love Ella Speed six feet in the groun',
Lawd, Lawd, an' they ain' no hangin' [aroun'] aroud'."
[*repeat*]
