Without the influence of the Negro, America would have lost
half her music, would have lost (OLD DAN TUCKER) - would never
have owned this song about death and the man it celebrates (MAN GOIN' ROUND).
The Yankee slave-traders, the Southern Plantation owners, the
abolitionists, the rebs, didn't know what was going on underneath
the barriers and the prejudices. Negro and white folk singers
were constantly collaborating, swapping, and stealing from each
other. Out of this process of mixture came
The Negro hoe-down
The White minstrel show
The Negro spiritual
and
The Music of Foster

The Negro Blues
The White Hill-billy songs

Old Man River
Negro work songs
