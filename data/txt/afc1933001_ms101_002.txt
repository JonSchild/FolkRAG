January 6, 1947

Dear Mr. Lomax,

Your letter of November 14 has gone unanswered for so long because of a case of virus pneumonia which kept me away from the office for several weeks. I am still somewhat weak but am gradually getting back to normal. At any rate I have arranged to pay the bill for the Sellers Company and they should receive their check in the immediate future. I have also asked our Recording Laboratory to prepare a set of duplicates for Mr. Devall and send it to him. Will you want duplicates for Mr. Devall and send it to him. Will you want duplicates for yourself also? If so please let me know at once so that I can have them copied at the same time as the ones for Devall.

I was surprised to read that you were disappointed with the quality of Devall's singing. Dr. Emrich and I listened to a few of the records recently and liked them very much. In fact we are giving very serious consideration to the possibility of including one or more of them in an album we are preparing this winter. His style of singing is a peculiar one, and there were many traits which reminded us of the southern Appalachians. Do you happen to know where he was born?

As you probably know it is practically impossible for us to get expense money for singers, and I fear that I can not arrange this at this point in the proceedings. On the other hand, if we do put any of his records in our albums he will receive the special fee which we pay to the singers. I shall let you know as soon as we come to a decision on this point. In the meantime please accept my gratitude for your continued interest in our collection. We are very pleased with what you have sent us.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
