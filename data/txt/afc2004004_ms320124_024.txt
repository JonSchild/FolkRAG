English began to be enforced in 1916.  And that coupled with
the effects of World War I which took away a generation of
young Arcadian men and for the first time in their, in the
history of their culture it forced them to realize that they
weren't a majority.  That they were instead a minority in
America.  They'd always, you know, the world ended at the
[Sabine] and the Mississippi for them.  And so to be brought
out to camps and then off to Europe was a, a traumatic
thing.  New roads and highways during the, Hughie Long and
Earl Long '30s opened up this area greatly.  And, for, for a,
for once the, for the first time the Arcadian, the Cajun
country wasn't isolated.  And all of those things came
 together at a, at a, in an unfortunate barrage of sequences,
you know, that, coupled with the mass media, you know, radio
and television were invented and began to import culture
from the outside and it was all too, it all came all at once
and it was all too much to handle.  And the Cajun culture
really went on the wain in the '20s and '30s and '40s.
      And by then it was enough to stop somebody
from doing, from doing something to simply say don't do
that, that's Cajun, you know.  No, nobody would speak French
in the streets if they could help it.  Parents avoided like
the plague speaking French to their children so that they 
wouldn't have to suffer the same woes that they had at
school writing a thousand times I will not speak French on
