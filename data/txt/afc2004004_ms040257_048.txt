There came three Jews
From the land of Spain
To call upon
My sister Jane.

My sister Jane
Is far too young
I cannot bear
Her chattering tongue.

Go away Corkscrew
My name is not Corkscrew
I stomp my foot
And away I go.

Come back,  come back
Your coat's so grey
And choose the fairest
One you see.

Come back,  come back
Your voice is true
And choose the fairest 
One you knew.

Come back,  come back
Your coat's all green
And choose the fairest
One you've seen.

The fairest one
That I can see
Is bonnie wee Jean
Will ye come to me.

Now we've got the fairy queen
The fairy queen,  the fairy queen
Now we've got the fairy queen
E,  i,  o,  sir.

Now I've got the Prince of Wales,
The Prince of Wales, the Prince of Wales,
Now I've got the Prince of Wales,
To help me with my washing.

Jack be nimble
Jack be quick
Jack jump over 
The candlestick
Stick stick
Candlestick.
