San Antonio, August 3
Rommel telephones another German general for assistance, saying
he desperately needed reinforcements; the other general (whose name I
have forgotten) replied that he had no more troops, tanks, planes, or
other equipment than were essential to protect his own position. Rommel
waited an hour, telephones again saying he would have to retreat if the
English attacked and if no help were available. The English then tried
to attack, falling into the trap set for them and losing 240 of the 300
tanks. Given, although sympathetically, as an illustration of the lack
of astuteness on part of Allies. 38
