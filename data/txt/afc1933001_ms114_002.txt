Dear Alan and Elizabeth,
We were alld delighted with the Santa Claus that we 
found on the table upon our arrival,and we had it all thoroughly
assigned and examined befroe ever we put down our bundles
or told Mike where to set the bags. Thank you heartily for your
thoughtfulness. Shirley stayed over till Tuesday under the impression
that Chris had gone fishing. Bess left the next Sunday.
Meantime my little nephew from New Mexico kept me busy keeping 
him employed. We miss you and Corey and hope you will not 
postpone so long coming this way. It turned out that Margaret
had to go back to bed with cold packs and sulfanilamide before
her feet came back to normal size. Johnny reports her all right
now. We ramble [rabe] off to Colorado this week, I suppose, via Lubbock.
Your father is not very well,but he seems to thrive better when his
mind is occupied with other thoughts than his [his] physical ailments.
Dr. Neighbors seems to think he knows what ails him but has not explained
details to me. He does say that his teeth do not require extract in
Again thanks for the pretties. Are your living quarters comfortable?
We have had only three or four hot days. Much Love
Deanie
