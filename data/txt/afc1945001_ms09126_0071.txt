(1) About 2 weeks ago, I was told that dresses were to be rationed on a Sunday at midnight just as shoes were. This rumor started in a beauty shop, so far, it hasn't occured. 

(2) I heard that a girl living in New York has acquired almost a crate box of "[?] sugar". This habit started when she was in her teens. She happened to remember the last war, that is, the rationing and decided to save sugar so, if their was another war, she'd have sugar to use. Now she says, "Mama, I told you so". (She told her mother there was to be another war & she'd need sugar)
