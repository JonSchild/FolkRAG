To Alan Lomax

Mr. Spivacke
Dear Sir:
Along last summer
there was a gentleman by the name
of Lomax out in this country making
phonograph records of old time songs.
He made a record of a couple of
songs by my wife and myself.
Amazing Grace on one side, by my wife
and me and the Roving Gambler on [wife]
the other by me.
If you can reproduce them and send
me two records of them, I would appreciate
it very much.
If you will send them C.O.C. I will
gladly pay for them, if you please.
With a great deal of thank thrown
in.
Yours Very truly
W. V. Braley
