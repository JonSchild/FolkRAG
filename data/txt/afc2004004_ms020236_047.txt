You see?   You know, to carry it to his house.   So, that was fair 
enough; I didn' know where to carry 'em, ya see.   [But] So the chile 
come late that evenin' an' I took 'em -- some of 'em wasn' quite 
dry an' I piled 'em on top of 'em -- the two boys came an' they 
had wheelbarrows an' I just put 'em on the big tubs an' put 'em on, 
ov' that.  So.  [*(THE NEXT A.M.)*] Then I had to go to his house to iron.  I said, 
"I dunno where his house is."    So they tol' me where his house.  
was.   So I went ov' to his house; nobody had opened my eyes yet; 
I didn' know.   I went on to his house.   This woman was there.  
An' three lil' chilruns.   An' they had 'nother great big chilruns 
but they wasn't there.   Jus three lil'-sized ones, like.   An' ah, 
I ironed.   She tol' me she knew I was comin' to iron.   An' I 
spoke to 'er an' she asked me about breakfas'.   Well, I didn' 
want no breakfas'.   She fixed dinner.  Well, I didn' eat no 
dinner.  I eat some cookies.  I 'member well, I eat some 
cookies an' I boiled a aig (egg), 'cause I didn' like her cookin'.  
Lookin'.   I didn' like lookin' at [her] the kitchen, ya know.   An' I 
jus' didn' like it.   Ya know.   It make me sick.   In my min'... It 
jus'. . .me. . .I boil an aig an' I eat some cookies.
TL:        What was wrong with the kitchen?
BJ:        Jus' nasty, you know, I didn' like it, those nasty chilrun, nasty lil' 
bits of things. . .So anyhow, I was ironin'.   I ironed an' I ironed 
and I ironed.   Had flat irons, ya know, heat to the fire.   You 
know.    An' ah, I ironed an' I ironed.   So later on [that] the evenin', 
no, not so later -- no, at dinner time -- a boy came in, a big, man-
lookin' boy.   See, that was the chilrun he had by the woman in 
New York.   He had two grown sons.   An' this big boy come in; I [said,] thought it
 [That] might be the man, ya know.   But I looked an' see he wasn't.
'Cause he wasn't the same man that asked me.   He said, "Daddy 
says, if you don't get through ironin' -- "  Said, "Don't rush 
to get through ironin'."   Said, "He'll take you home."   I said, 
"Oh," I said, "Thank ya, cause I really got a pile here to iron."  
Said, "I was thinkin' I had to come up tomorrow."  
An so he said, "Don't rush."  He said, "Daddy'll take you home."
