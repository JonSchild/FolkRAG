"There's fifty-two switches in Cool King" I said, "Now, you
can get down to where I can't block you", I said, "But if you
get down anywhere at all", I say, "I'm gon put you in a ten
card hole, or I'm gonna (tirol?) you."  "You can't do me
that!".  We played three games, we tabbed two.  And the last
game. . --I put im in the ten card hole. . last card I hit im
with was king of spades.  He had from the ace to the king.  I
said, "Now, what is you gon to win with?"  I say, "You got
six-a-clubs in your hand" I said, "That would be my folding
card if I didn't have the five and four of clubs"  I said,
"I'm gonna (pay the stake?) when it comes" I said, "There may
