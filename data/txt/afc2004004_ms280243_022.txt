3)  We all arose, put on our clothes, our hearts was full of grief,
Our friends who stood around the coach could grant us no relief,
Our parents, wives and sweethearts, their hearts were broke in twa,
Tae see us leave the hills and dales o' Caledonia.

4)  Here's to my old father, amongst the best of men,
Here's to my young sweetheart, young Catherine is her name,
But here's to my old mother, it's when I'm far awa',
Far, far frae all the hills and dales o' Caledonia.
