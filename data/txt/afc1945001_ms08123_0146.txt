There rationing sugar, 
There rationing fats
There rationing meats
But I be darn if they're
rationing those wacky Japs.

There rationing Beans
    "         "    "       Shoes
There rationing all foods
And isn't it find that
they can't ration the
 Japs [and his brothers.]

You can shoot one
   "      "        "     two
You can shoot any amount
and you don't have to be chosie
who you choose.

You can shoot with an ye open
   "      "        "        "    both eyes close
But it don't make any different
As long as you shoot them off of
there toes.
