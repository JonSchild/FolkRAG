     (I don't want you to say anything that makes yo u feel
nervous.)
     Naw. I ain't said nervous.  But yet an still, I don't
want to die.  Not be killed.  I ain't nevah wanna be killed. 
     (This will never be used in any way that would be
harmful to you.  We hope that we can use parts of your story to
help put an end to discrimination.)
     I tole you, though, the only thing that would help.
We that don't believe in discrimination will have to git togethah
in prayer.  Prayer will take keer of all of it.  Can be many
things multiplied between you and God, don't nobody nevah have to
know anything about.  No wondah the old poet-writh said:
     "Prayer is the soul's sincere desire
      Unuttered and unexpressed
      Emotion of a hidden fire
      That trembles in the breast."
     Yo u can always pray an talk to me all the same time,
an I won't nevah know what you're doin.  I'll think you're doin
nothin but jes talkin. . .That's the ole poet-writah that wrote the
song.  I did know what sone it is, but anyhow, I've heard it sung
in churches many times.  (He blows his nose)  Yes, has a tune.
     (People cannot always say everything that they feel,
can they?)
     Naw, but you can always think.  So deeply.  If you feel
like that you wanted to express yourself an couldn't, you
could think right deeply.  A deep thought is much more than jes a 
speakin a thing. . .If yo u see a thing that you wish you could git
in session of, that you jis wish you had, you wouldn't say nothin
to em, would you?  You'd jes git in a deep thought.  Jes bout how you
could enjoy us.  An jes thinkin of it -- how it would be if you could
reach it -- done you as much good as if you got in session of it.
