Chief, Special Services Division 
Office of War Information
Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Katz:

You have kindly sent me Copy 167 of the Confidential Report Rumors 
in Wartime, and invite me to comment.

Recently I wrote comments on Special Study 21 issued by Program Surveys, 
and most of my critical remarks are already on record. Regarding 
the present report I will record a few additional impressions:

(1) The Report seems a bit diffuse, headed neither toward a specific 
intelligence program of further study, nor toward an action program.

(2) Most of all do I miss any account of the control of rumor (See 
Knapp's reports of the Boston operations).

(3) Since in point of fact, some localities (at least the Boston 
area) have proceeded so much further in efforts at rumor control than have 
Washington agencies, I think a report on these decentralized operations 
is in order. Until your office has made this investigation I challenge 
the vague assertion (page 18) that "Local campaigns to counteract rumors 
have a limited usefulness. There is danger that they may, if carelessly 
directed, spread the rumors which they seek to scotch. They need careful 
supervision and coordination with federal policy."

In Boston within the past month we have had 150 requests from all over 
the country for help in establishing "rumor clinics" or else campaigns of 
local education. Likewise on the basis of our work Life, Time, the Reader's 
Digest and the American Magazine will within the next few weeks carry 
additional stories designed for public education.

Since we have most carefully directed this activity toward control
and education we do not yet accept the statement that "There is danger that 
they may, if carelessly directed, spread the rumors which they seek to scotch. 
They need careful supervision and coordination with federal policy."
