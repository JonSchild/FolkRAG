Rumor Report
Attached you will find special Intelligence Report, dated
9/30/42, subject - Rumors.

Perhaps no single subject has engaged the fancy and the
attention of more information men in the government than rumors.
In fact, the study of rumors has itself been the subject of rumors.

This first Bureau of Intelligence canvass of the subject
will, we feel, put an end to a good many half-truths which have been
circulated among us about rumor and, more important, will indicate
certain directions in which positive work can be done to neutralize
rumors.

One additional thing this study makes plain: "Don't talk" 
and "don't rumor" are quite different as informational themes. Careless
talking may give valuable information to the enemy.  Careless
rumor mongering, this study shows, isn't calculated so frequently to
give valuable information to the enemy.  Its danger lies in its harmful
effects on Americans themselves.

The material embodied in this report may suggest to the 
Bureau of Publications and Graphics several treatments of the subject
of rumor, such as magazine articles for both the class and the smooth
paper magazine publics, pictorial treatment in the picture magazines,
such as LOOK, LIFE, PIX, CLICK, etc., and perhaps graphics treatments
of the kind clearly distinguished from that used in the security
campaign for circulation in places where more articulate and better
informed people gather - night clubs, bars, country clubs, social
clubs, hotels, theatre lobbies and the better department stores.

Obviously the personnel of your Bureau will be better able
to determine the adaptability of this study to its problems than we
are.
