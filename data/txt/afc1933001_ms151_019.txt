Dear Alan (which is a swell way to
begin a letter to you when I'm not sure
that you even remember me!) I've just
replied to [Geo. Herzog] D.H. Daugherty's
request for information about my collection
of spirituals, etc, from back country
churches in Ala. & Miss. Do you remember
hearing some of 'em when you came in on
"my audition" with Herzog & the man then in
the "lib. of Congress"? I had 'em all on acetate
records. You stayed late to hear more, and
we had a lunch date afterwards.
They're still on soft records, tho hardly
played at all--75 spirituals at least that
I haven't been able to find in any collection
of "words & music"--I went thru every book on
the subject in N.Y.C. library as a 10 hr day, 1 mo.
