Dear Bill:
Here is a tentative program for the 'shebang' on
March 1.
1. Introduction .......Lomax
2. Get Along Little Dogies.....Lomax
3. Old Joe Clark.........Pete Seeger (with Banjo)
4. Darling Corey or The Golden Vanity...Pete Seeger
(with banjo)
5. Four short pieces by Burl Ives (in medley form)
a. Po Wayfaring Stranger
b. Haul Away Joe
c. I Gave My Love a Cherry
d. Cotton Eyed Joe
6. Jim Crack Corn....Burl and Golden Gate
7. Man Goin' Round [xxxxx]....Joshua White and Golden Gate
8. Frankie and Albert......Joshua and Gate
9. In the Enening....Joshua
10. JohnHenry.........Joshua
11. Ham and Eggs........Golden Gate
12. Let Me Ride.......Golden Gate
13. You Better Run.....Golden Gate
14. Noah.........Golden Gate
15. Roll Em ........ Pete Johnson
16. Sunshine ...........Sidney Bechett & Group
17. Careless Love .........Entire Cast

Of course, we can change the numbers a little but the
last one I'm particularly enthusiastic about because we can
give the tune to Pete,, then let Joshua try it out on the
guitar, ,then the Gate, then Sidney, and in the end with a group
rendition with the audience. Item Jim Crack Corn is a minstrel
number with definite white influence and it is therefore appropriate
for the Golden Gate to sing it with Burl as leader.
Musically, it's simply delightful.
Sincerely, 
Alan
