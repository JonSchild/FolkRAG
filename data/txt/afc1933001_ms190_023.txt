From letter of December 8, 1942 - from Willis Lawrence James.

     I would like to make studies of folk songs of this
period in general (the war) and, if it is possible, to work
in some camps with the soldiers--especially those in Georgia.
. . . . I would collect, also, any Negro material which I might
find--particularly in Fort Valley festivals*. . . . . 

     I know of two Negroes who have written or composed
songs about the war effort. They are both in the Fort Valley
area. I can procure records of their work and at the same time
I can engage some folk singers to aid in the production of these
songs. I have a wide acquaintance with some folks in Georgia
and Alabama who may be of help. However, there are many
itinerant songs, for instance:

     "Trains use' to run by schedule
      Now dat ain't wort' a dam.
      Since Hitler start' to raisin' hell
      Dey runs by Uncle Sam." etc.

     I got this from a group of selectees who were waiting 
for a train long overdue. It is a good song of several
stanzas. I made no effort to acquire data on the song because
I could not at the time. However, my ears have been trained
to grasp things, so that I learned it on the spot and set it
down as soon as I could. I learn to sing it with the folk, also,
so that I can sing scores of songs which I acquire under conditions
where recording is not possible.

     While the language of the above song is rather
forthright there is a strong note of patriotism in the song--
it seems to say that what we are accustomed to, in the way of
conveniences, must be put aside or adapted to [cause of] stop[ping]
Hitler (from raisin' hell).


* The music which Mr. Bond and Mr. James have produced at
   their festivals is, in some respects, quite unique and if 
   Mr. James can produce, say, a hundred records of equally
   unique material, his time will have been well spent.
