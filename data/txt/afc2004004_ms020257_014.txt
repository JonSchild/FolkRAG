     So the last night that we was there, we played -- She had
a, ah, two-storey thing.  But, uh, uh, up in the one part a it.
she wasn't usin' it for nothin' but fruits.  You know, to put, to
stow away fruits.  You know, one part of [it was jest for a] this two-storey building.
'Cause that's the way they did up there, ya know; they
back, ya know, from year to year.  All kinda fruits an' stuff up
there, ya know, blackberries, peaches, plums; anything that they
can can, ya know, was up there, too.  An' so we was up there an'
Mama said, wasn', wasn' gonna let me play up there.
     So anyway, the last night, they askted Mama to let 'Lizabeth
sleep with them.  You know, "'Cause she, she gonna leave tomorra."
     I, I didn' like that a bit.
     An' Mama say, "Yeah!"  Say, "She can sleep with ya all."
     An' I, I said it, I didn' say nothin'.  Put on my
clo'es' I went to bed; an' time for us to go to bed.  An' ah, I
didn' go to sleep.  I cried;  I fussed; I fussed; an' I kicked;
an' I won't let 'em tech me; all kinda things.  It went on for a 
long time.  They didn't call nobody; they didn't say nothin'.  An'
I went on.
     The ol' winds curtain, there was a -- the pane was broke out up
on the other side.  An' the wind blowed on it.  An' it made it
flop.  So Aunt Lilla heard it.  So she come in there to stop it
so it wouldn't keep us from not bein', you know, awaken up.  An'
while she was tryin' to fix that, she heard me sniffin'.  An'
she wonder what was the matter.  An' I tol' 'er I didn' wanna
sleep with these ol' yalla chilren.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  I wish
I could see 'er.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
     She say, "What!"
     "I don' wanna sleep with [these] the ol' yalla chilluns an' they 
stink!"  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
