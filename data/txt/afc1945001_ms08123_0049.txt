Rumors
I heard a rumor a couple of weeks ago concerning 
work in war plants. 
It seems a woman was working in a gun powder 
manufacturer plant. After work one day she decided to 
go to a beauty Shop and surprise her husband by
looking lovely when she went home. 
While the operater was in the prossess of curling
her hair with an electric curling machine
the woman's head exploded killing both the operator
and the woman. It was discovered latter that the 
lady had gotten some gunpowder in her hair and
t had not been washed thouroughly.
