Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am glad to learn that it will be possible for 
you to appear on the program of our April 2 meeting here.  The 
programs are being mimeographed, and I shall see that one is 
sent you as soon as they are finished.

So far as I know at present, I shall be able to 
get away for a few days (perhaps a week) during the first part 
of April, and can act as your "contact man."  As to the number 
of tunes that can be recorded at that time, I can't be at all 
definite, as I shall have to do some corresponding before your 
arrival.  However, I believe that I can safety promise you 
thirty or thirty-five.  If Lady Luck smiles on our efforts, we 
may secure many more than that.

Professor Thompson asks me to say that he and Mrs. 
Thompson shall be glad to have you as their guest during your 
stay in Bloomington.

Sincerely yours,
Paul G. Brewster
