The Weaver and his Gruel.,
1) There was a weaver of the North,
And oh, but he was cruel,
The very first night that he got wed
He sat and grat for gruel.
He widna wint his gruel,
He widna wint his gruel,
O the very first night that he got wed
He sat and grat for gruel.

2) There is nae a pot in a' the house
That I can mak your gruel.
O the washin' pot it'll do wi' me,
For I maun hae my gruel.
For I maun hae my gruel,
I canna wint my gruel,
O the washin' pot it'll do wi' me,
For I maun hae my gruel.

3) There is nae a spoon in a' the house
That ye can sup your gruel.
O the garden spade it'll do wi' me,
For I maun hae my gruel, etc. .

4) She gaed ben the house for cakes and wine
She brought them on a tray,
O gae wa', gae wa' wi' your falderals,
For I maun hae my gruel, etc. .

5) Come all young lassies, take my advice
And never marry a weaver,
The very first night that he got wed
He sat and grat for gruel.
He widna wint his gruel,
He widna wint his gruel,
O the very first night that he got wed
He sat and grat for gruel.
