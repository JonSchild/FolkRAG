HENRY TRAVILLION page 4

Lightning - the black Apollo -  whose beautiful body resembled an Apollo in

bronze - leads the axe-cutting song.  He has been called Lightning by his

mates because of his lightning-thinking in getting out of verbal difficulties

when he becomes involved with the White boss.  He claimed that his real name

was Washington and that he was a nephew of Booker Washington - the great

Negro who was for many years President of Tuskeegee Institute in Alabama.

When I went to Tuskeegee afterwards - I inquired about Lightning's claim.

The Vice President of the school told me that President Booker Washingtion

never had a brother.
