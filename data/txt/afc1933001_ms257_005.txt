Dear Magdalena
How are you and how
is your work getting on
As you will note by
this letter that I am as
yet in the Capital and
that this little note comes
to you with the kindness
of my good friend Alan
Lomax who is coming to
pay a visit to your beautiful
Mexico.  Mr. Lomax is in
charge of Archives of American
folk music and knowing that
you are much interested
in Mexican folk music I 
am curious that you will 
enjoy meetting my friend
and to talk to him about Mexican
folk music and surely he
will enjoy meeting you.
I wish I could be coming
to Mexico myself at this
time but perhaps later in
the season. I hope to come
and say hello to you and 
beautiful Mexico.  How
is our friend Montenegro
?.... Magdalena have my
friend Lomax meet Montenegro
and some of our other friends
I am sure they will enjoy
him.  So Magdalena good
luck to you and god bless
you with good hope to see
you soon  Bein aminca
