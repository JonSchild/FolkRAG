the same reasons.
The reason these
mice are called spinners
because the spin
so much. They remind
you of a dog chasing 
its tail. Spinners
are used in hospitals
for children who have
St. Vidus Dance and
other nervous people.
While watching these 
mice you forget everything
else. Our dog
even forgot to bark
while she was watching
the mice and someone 
knocked on our door.
Spinning mice will
probably be used a
great deal after the war
is over when soldiers all
over the world will be 
home and will want to 
forget about the war.
