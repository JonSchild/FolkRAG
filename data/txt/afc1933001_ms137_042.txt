Dear Dr. Spivacke,
I discovered yesterday [that] after I sent you my last letter 
that the brake lining was completely finished in my car and that 
besides new linings I shall probably need a new set of drums. That
makes the matter of an advance a little more urgent than I had at 
first thought.  Also I think you had better hurry along a shipment of 
discs as fast as possible.  I have fifty left and I hope my luck 
will be good for the next few days. My schedule will be as follows 
so far as I can plan it:  Ironwood Michigan, 26th and 27th, Oct. 1st
Duluth, Minn.. Let me know in Ironwood how long it will take you 
to ship me 75 discs and I will airmail you instructions as to where 
they should meet me.  Would it be possible for you to arrange the 
advance to meet me in Ironwood?  Sorry this has come up, but how 
could I know I would have twenty dollars in repair bills so soon.

Yours,
Alan
