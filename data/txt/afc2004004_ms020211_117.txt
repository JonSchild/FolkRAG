Dear Miss Jones:

It has been suggested that you would be interested in presenting a children's
program at the Walker Art Center on Sunday, February 9, following your C.A.C.
engagement.  I would be delighted to have you appear as part of our program
for children, ages 5 through 12, with any selections you feel would be of
interest to this age.  The programs are scheduled for 3 p.m. and last one
hour; they are usually held in our Lecture Gallery and seated in an informal
manner.

Our standard fee for a special Sunday event would be seventy-five ($75)
and would be mailed to you after the program.

If you are interested in this possibility, please let me know as soon as possible.
Sincerely yours,
Nancy Forte
Assistant Curator
