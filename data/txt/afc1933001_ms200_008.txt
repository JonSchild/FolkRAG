June 22, 1964

Dear Alan:
Rae is presently on leave for three weeks, and
will answer your letter of June 17 as soon as she returns.

We were sorry to have missed you on your recent
visit to Washington. The Archive offices are now comfortably
air conditioned, which is especially welcome on hot
days like this.

With very best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Joseph C. Hickerson
Reference Librarian
Archive of Folk Song
