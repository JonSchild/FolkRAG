Bog Trotters Play For
National Radio Audience

Southwest Virginia's mountain songs, stories, and square dance tunes
went out to the nation yesterday over Roanoke radio station WDBJ as the
local studios fed the Columbia Broadcasting System's entire nationwide
hookup on the regular Tuesday folk music program of the American
School of the Air.

Play Dance Tunes

The program, attempting to interpret
to America's school children
the part played by the square dance
tunes in the social life of the nation,
particularly the eastern mountain
sections. The Bog Trotters,
string group from Galax, was chosen
as guests on the program with Alan
Lomax, folk music specialist of CBS.

The Bog Trotters were on the air
twice yesterday from the local studios,
and both times WDBJ broadcast
the program. The morning program
went to east and central
portions of the country, the afternoon
broadcast to the West.

As a studio audience at the two
broadcasts were members of the recently
created educational advisory
committee for WDBJ, and two
classes of school children.

Members of the WDBJ production
staff assisted William Fineshriber
of Columbia and Mr. Lomax in producing
yesterday's show and Paul
Reynolds, studio director and announcer
of WDBJ, handled the announcing
on the broadcast. Henry
Francis, local trumpeter, played the
trumpet fanfare which introduces
the School of the Air programs.

The Bog Trotters are composed
of Uncle Alec Dunford, first fiddle,
Uncle Davy Crockett Ward, second
fiddle, Fields Ward, guitar, Wade
Ward, banjo, and Dr. W. P. Davis,
auto-harp.

Besides playing several old dance
tunes and ballads, the Bog Trotters
enacted the famous old incident of
"The Arkansas Traveller," and Uncle
Alec told one of his humorous
stories such as are part of every
mountain neighborhood frolic. Lomax
was commentator on the broadcast.
