I now quote you a letter which was received by the Editor
of the Times-Dispatch from Mr. John M. Gandy, President, Emeritus
Virginia State College for Negroes, Petersburg, Virginia.

"Many thousands of Negroes make their living by working as
domestics in the homes of white people.  It would be a very
sad occasion for the Negroes if the white people should be
inclined to believe the false rumors circulated by these ill-designing
persons.  However, these rumors are going the rounds
at a time when it is most propitious for those for whom they
are intended most readily to believe them.  It would be quite
an injustice to the Negro if these rumors should upset the
thinking of the white people and lead to the loss of the
domestic jobs the Negroes now occupy.

The Negro domestic and his employer have for many  years
known each other and neither would be inclined to believe
rumors that seem to have no foundation in fact.  No fifth
columnist should be permitted to destroy the good will and
understanding between the races at such a time as this when
the peace and happiness between the races is very much needed.

It is quite natural that any domestic worker would welcome
a chance to earn larger wages so as to enable him to live better
and take care of his responsibilities.  These domestics have
children to be educated and other responsibilities to be taken 
care of, and the South as well as the North should realize
these conditions when the pay checks of the domestic care are thought
of. Similar conditions obtained during World War No. 1. 
Domestics moved from private homes to industrial plants, camps
and so on as they could earn a larger wage. There does not
seem to be any reason they should not do this at this time.

There are some conditions under which co-operation between
Negroes and white people is far from what it should be, but
every effort should be made to correct these defects as fast as
possible, for we are all anxious that nothing will get in the
way of America's winning this war.  Do not let either the
Negroes or the whites rock the boat during these critical times."

I am here quoting an editorial taken from the front page of the
Norfolk Journal and Guide, which is a Negro newspaper.

Rumors Fantastic, Unfounded

"The rumor, false and vicious, was that colored women were
being organized under the name of "Daughters of Eleanor."
