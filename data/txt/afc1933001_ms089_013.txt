sick business.  He then went to work with the Chicago Flexible
Shaft.  They were a hard boiled institution without any college
men and they did not think he could make good.  Fortunately
there was an Irishman in Cleveland named Daly who liked him
and asked him to go down there as his assistant.  He was the
only junior salesman that got on the office bulletin twice a
year ago, and he would had his own territory if it had
not been for the war.  But the important part of it was they
asked him if he could get one or more college men to come
into their sales force.  They have a perfectly darling little girl
of four, who missed my birthday by only two hours.  They expect
another baby in February.  He has been an isolationist, but I
feel that somehow he can make a living.  I may state that all
of them are still on my payroll, which doesn't make it any
easier.

Yours sincerely,
