THE READER'S DIGEST

bolding the bag qualifies easily; Thomas Jefferson used it in 1801.
  Among the lushest sources of D.A.E. material are the books by Mark Twain, which contain more than 12,000 Americanisms, and reveal that Twain used whoopee half a century before Walter Winchell re-introduced it, and gave currency to such poker-game phrases as passing the buck, four-flushing, sitting pretty and new deal.
  For many of Mark Twain's Americanisms his wife deserves part of the credit, Mrs. Clemens permitted no swearing in her home or in her husband's books, so that Sam was reduced from cursing to cussing. Among the Americanisms engendered by Mrs. Clemens' taboos were all-fired, Caesar's ghost, great guns, doggone it, suffering Moses.
  The D.A.E. has many uses. When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was filming Gone with the Wind, the question arose: Did youngsters shoot craps in pre-Civil War New Orleans? In 1843, according to the D.A.E., a man named Green wrote: 
  The Game of Craps. . . is a game lately introduced into New Orleans, and is fully equal to faro in its. . . ruinous effects.
Impressed, M-G-M purchased a D.A.E. of its own.
  The history of some typically American words is surprising. For instance, baseball was not invented here at all; Jane Austen used it in Nortbanger Abbey half a century before its first American appearance. And cowboy was not originally a Western word. Before the days of dude ranches most cattle-herders thought of themselves as cow-punchers, or cowbands or buckaroos (from Spanish vaqueros). The word cowboy was in fact an Eastern word, used to describe George III's fifth column in the American colonies. The cowboys of those days were Tory sympathizers who wandered through the woods at night ringing cowbells. Unsuspecting American patriots sallied forth with lanterns in search of the straying bossies and were promptly shot.
  Words, like hats, readily succumb to changes in style. Take the many words our ancestors used to describe a hurried departure. Our great-grandfathers absquatulated, as in the sentence: "I absquatulated away from that vicinity in a hurry." Our grandfathers skedaddled. Many of us in our younger days vamoosed. Youngsters today simply scram.
  Common words, however, constitute the bulk of the D.A.E.'s contents. When you get up from you rocking chair, button your vest, put on your rubbers, dash for the elevator, reach the sidewalk, and make a beeline for the automobile which you carelessly parked in front of a hydrant when you came downtown, you are using words of American origin all along the way.
