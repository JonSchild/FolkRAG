Mrs Hall and Dack Reed, who claimed [???] 
to be cousins (one day when they both
tired of singing she sat in his lap), 
sang many spirituals together.  
Dack lived in the country.  Vera in town.
When I could get Vera away from 
Dack I could persuade her to sing 
"sinful" songs.  One afternoon
she was sitting before the microphone
in the back yard of the home
of Mrs. Ruby Dicken's Fortt
Livingston, Alabama when she suddenly 
broke out
"When I wo' my apron low
couldn't keep you from my jo', 
Fare-you-well, oh, honey, 
Fare-you-well"
