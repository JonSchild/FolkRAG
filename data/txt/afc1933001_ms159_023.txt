Dear Dr. Lomax:

I am at work on a book about the Southern
Highlands, for which I have done a good deal of research. 
I am anxious to have a chapter on the folk
songs, spirituals, and ballads of the mountaineers.

Could you give me any suggestions as to 
where and how I could procure material?

If I could get enough material, I would
like to have a chapter on spirituals of the Southern
Highlanders, and another on folk songs and ballads;

I would be glad of any suggestions you
are willing to give me. I have worked among the
mountain people in Tennessee and in Kentucky.

Sincerely yours,
Harriet G. Brown
