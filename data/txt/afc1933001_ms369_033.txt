Students of the ballads can be roughly divided into
two opposing groups: those who believe that the folk derive their
best songs and poems from skilful poets of the upper classes,
that they make no very positive contribution to these poems and
songs except in a degenerative sense; those who believe that ballads
and folk-songs grow up out of the homogeneous folk group and that
the best qualities of these songs are attributable to that
origin. The latter point of view has from the eigthteenth century
to the present day been the most generally accepted. It has been
given precedence in the "Cambridge History of English Literature"
in encyclopedias, and in text books. It has been the
attitude of most collectors of English and American folk-songs---
which as we shall show later on is likely to predjudice the evidence. 
In Thus the field has been defined by what we shall call
the "communalist" theory and until that theory has been presented
at least in putline we shall hardly no what we are talking about.
