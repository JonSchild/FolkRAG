BJ TAPE 2, p. 7

BJ: (Cont.) He said, "I ain't thought about you no more. You
don't know what you're talking about." Ha, ha!
So I said, "Well, man, you don't know. I had it in my mind
to put the ol' knife through you." Ha, ha ha! Said to myse'f,
you know, "You, you don't know I had my whole mind to put that knife
through you." Ha, ha, hm. Well, Lord, I was so angry. Great 
goodness! I never see --
An' I said to myself, "That's the way some people let Satan
rule them." You know, the devil say, "Oh, he done so-and-so; he
shouldn'ta done so-and-so." Goin' by thoughts, you know, and
foolishness. It jus' ain' no good. It ain't nothin', Ain'
nothin' to it -- not one thing.
An' it goes on to read and see where God made the whole
world flower, every tree, every bush, an' then makin' them --
had to make diffrunt flowers to make a bo-kay (bouquet). You see? Tha's
for us to pick an' gather. An' we's for Him to pick an' gather.
He said to make diffrunt colors for, for a bo-kay for Him. See,
'cause we's His flowers. He pick us as He want to [, ya know].
AL: Sure.
BJ: An' so tha's what that is. You never can tell. But, you
see, I didn't know that, didn't see into it, didn't know nothin' 
about it.
We used to have a word, say "Nigger." Great God! Some
people, a lot of folks in the grave today on accounts somebody
called 'em "Nigger." Ya see? Ya know, 'cause, 'cause they, they
got made about it, didn't understand.
An' ah, I 'member a white lady, my -- ah, I got a letter;
I want you to read it for me, too -- my white lady tol' me, say.
