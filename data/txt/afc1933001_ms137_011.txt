Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
Charlevoix,
Michigan.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
                                  I sent the check to you by airmail special delivery as soon as I received it yesterday. I was therefore surprised to get your wire this morning. I hope it reached you in time to save you from starvation.

                                  The three boxes of discs will be sent you by express today. I have asked Mr. Morgan to order the films for you. 

                                  I took up the matter of an advance with Mr. Rabbitt but he seemed unwilling to grant it. In fact he seemed disappointed that you had made no effort to liquidate the advance which you have already received. Upon further investigation, however, I discovered your voucher for $205 and found that by exerting all pressure and influence at my command, I could probably rush this payment through within a short time. I did this and the voucher is now at the account office with instructions to be rushed there.

                           Mr. Rabbitt, however, called my attention to the fact that $101 of this voucher was for subsistence and should therefore be deducted as partial liquidation of the advance. This would leave you almost $100 which could be sent you very soon. If this arrangement is satisfactory and will relieve you financially for the time being, I shall do nothing further in the matter. If you want more money, however, please let me know immediately by airmail letter and I shall try to argue Mr. Rabbitt out of the deduction of part or all of the subsistence item. I hope that I have made the situation clear to you. 
                                   
                                                 Sincerely, 
                                                                  Harold Spivacke
                                                                  Harold Spivacke
                                                                  Chief, Division of Music
P. S. I have read your report carefully and find it most interesting. I regret, however, that it will be necessary to cut out some of the nicest parts for reasons of state. (Part about buying votes, for instance.)
