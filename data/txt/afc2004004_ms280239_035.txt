Verse 2     REEL 45      (No. 2)
John Strahan

O! Rhynie's wark is ill to work
And Rhynie's wages are but sma'
And Rhynie's laws are double strick
And that does grieve me maist o' a'.
     Linten lowrin, lowrin linten, etc.

Ryhnie is a cauld clay hole
It isna like my faither's toon
And Rhynie it is an ugly place
It doesna suit a Lowland loon.
     Linten lowrin, lowrin linten. etc.

And sair I wroucht and sair I faucht
And sair I've won my penny's fee
And I'll gang back the way I've cam'
And a better bairnie I will be.
     Linten lowrin, lowrin linten, etc.
