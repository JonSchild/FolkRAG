Dear Miss Hutson:

I was very pleased to receive your
most interesting letter of November 23 and
to note your plans for recording folk songs.
Unfortunately, the Archive of American 
Folk-Songs has no funds which we could
place at your disposal. We hope, however,
to install in the very near future a machine
whereby we can make duplicates of records.
As soon as this is in operation, I shall
communicate with you again and trust that
you will allow us to copy your records for 
our files.

Sincerely yours.

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
