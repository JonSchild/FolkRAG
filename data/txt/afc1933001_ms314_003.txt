A GREAT MOVEMENT IN WHICH EVERYONE CAN HELP.
By C. ALPHONSO SMITH.

   English and Scottish ballads. - One of the greatest pieces of research
work ever done by an American was Prof. Francis J. Child's 
edition in 10 parts of "The English and Scottish Popular Ballads"
(1882-1898). He found that there were 305 of these old ballads, 
and nobody has yet succeeded in increasing or diminishing this
number. You will find all of these ballads (except 5) and many 
variants of them in a single volume called "English and Scottish
Popular Ballads," edited by Helen Child Sargent and George Lyman
Kittredge (Boston, 1904).
     English and Scottish ballads surviving in America. - An interesting
discovery made in recent years is that many of these old
ballads were brought by the earliest settlers to the United States
and have been kept alive through oral tradition ever since. Prof.
Child made no studied attempt to collect these American survivals, 
noting them only incidentally. He reports, if my account is correct, 2 in Maine, 2 in New Hampshire, 10 in Massachusetts, 5 in New York, 1 in Pennsylvania, 1 in Maryland, 4 in Virginia, 4 in North Carolina, and 1 in South Carolina. If we omit duplicates, the total is only 17. Now, however, at least 56 1 of the ballads in Prof. Child's list have been found in the United States and the search has hardly begun. Mr. Phillips Barry of Cambridge, Mass.; Prof. H. M. Belden, of Missouri; Prof. George Lyman Kittredge, of Harvard University; Prof. John A. Lomax, of Texas; and Prof. Hubert G. Shearin, of Kentucky, have been the leaders2 in this work of recovery, and have thus made every American citizen their debtor.
Importance of collecting American survivals. - Sidney Lanier did not overstate it when he said of these old ballads, "I know that he who walks in the way these following ballads point will be manful in
