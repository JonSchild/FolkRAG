Rest-room, Government Office 
(Two girls speaking) 

"You know that woman where I take my meals said 
she heard two soldiers talking about the situation, 
and they said it was expected that the western and 
eastern coasts of the United States would probably 
be attacked at the same time by the enemy!" 
[*1*]

"Wouldn't that be something.  I believe I'll look 
me up a dug-out right now and be ready for it."  

"You'd better be saying a few prayers for the boys 
who are here at home, while you are praying for those 
abroad."
