Dear Mr. Hobden:
Dr. Spivacke has handed me your letter for comment.
Your project seems to me an extremely intelligent and
creative one and I shall be glad to help in any way that
I can.
It seems to me basic that you buy for your project a group
of the best books of material available and see to it that
the boys absorb as many of the old tunes and old songs as 
possible. Trust them to supply their own improvisatory
decoration. I might suggest the following books for their
use:
"American ballads and Folk Songs" by John A.
Lomax and Alan Lomax
"Cowboy Songs" by John A. Lomax and Alan Lomax
"English Folk Songs from the Southern
Appalachians" by Cecil Sharpe, Oxford
University Press (This is in two volumes and
is the best single source for old and authentic 
mountain songs.)
"The American Songbag" by Carl Sandburg
"Thirsty and One Mountain Tunes" by Baskin Lamar
Lunsford
"Lonesome Tunes" by Lorraine Wyman
"Singing Cowboy" by Margaret Larkin
I should like to add to this preliminary and fairly basic
list of books two or three books of fiddle tunes, but I
am away from my office and their titles slip my memory.
I will send them to you when I return to Washington.
