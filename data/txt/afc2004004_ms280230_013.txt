Whip Jamboree & Pay Paddy Doyle for his Boots.

Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd & South Australia.

1) The pilot he looked out ahead
With a hand in the chains a-heaving of the lead.
And the old man rose to wake the dead,
"Come and get your oats, me son."
Chorus:
Whip jamboree, whip jamboree,
You long-tailed blackman come up behind,
Whip jamboree, whip jamboree,
Johnny get your oats, me son.

2) O now we've passed the Lizard lights
And the start, me boys, we'll heave in sight,
Soon be abreast of the Isle of Wight,
Come and get your oats, me son. (cho.)

3) O when we get to the Blackwall Dock
Them pretty young girls come down in flocks,
With their short-legged drawers and long-tailed frocks,
Come and get your oats, me son. (Chorus.)
----------
Paddy Doyle.

1) To me way-hey-ay-ay (roar) (or should bit be spelt "weigh"?)
We'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots.
To me way-hay-ay-ay (roar)
We'll all drink whiskey and gin.
To me way-hay-ay-ay (roar)
We'll all shave under the chin!
