Late on a rainy wintry Saturday evening Alan and I stopped Sugarland, Texas, a[n], and took from the express office a new recording machine that had just come in from
New York City. Then we drove out three miles to Central State Farm of the Texas Penitentiary
System, where Captain Flanagan kindly allowed us to bunk in the dormitory with
