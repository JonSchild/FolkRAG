Joke. 

A soldier took his girl out for a ride
at night. He stopped and parked 
along a road. He said to his girl, "Are
you a Chesterfield or a Camel?  She asked 
him what he meant. He said "Do 
you satisfy or do you walk a mile!"

I have heard that the moral standards 
of the men in the armed services are not
very high.
