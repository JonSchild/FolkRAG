said, "My little honey."
So the tee little warrior, youknow, pulled down in and said the wrong
thing. The preacher didn't said nothing but turned over and got off
of the same side he got in on. Got into his pants, walked right on
out the door after putting his pants on. "You have to come back,
Reverend." Say, "No. Uh-uh. Oh, that wasn't nothing but a trap."

The Woman Who Couldn't Count.
M. C. Orr.

That fellow come right in. So he wanted to make a date with the
girl. And he said he didn't pay the girl, just the amount they
could count to he's gonna pay um for that. "All right," the old 
lady says, "That's the chance to get rich, naturally (Laughter).
Then she called us in. "All right, Foke. I git the oldest one.
All right. Count." "Count you tell me? One - two - three."
The most she can count (laughter). The old lady, that made her mad.
"Three! You didn't make but three! You git out of here."
"All right. Count. Go ahead." "One, two." All right - two as
far as she could count. So she called the youngest one in there.
The old lady had a fit there at the end, boy.' she had't made but
$5 then (laughter). So they called the youngest in there and got
her in and she couldn't count but to one. So the old lady said,
"Have to git out of heere and let me show you how to make some
money." (laughter) So the old man put it on one side. Say, "That's
not it." He put it on the other and then put it back. Say, â€œThat's
not it." Bub-bub-bub-bub. She couldn't count. Bub-hub-bub-bub.
