BJ TAPE 3, p. 36

[*AVARICE*]
BJ:     Tha's, tha's one main thing I know.   An' the next thing, ah,
I believe, is the love of money.   Ya see, that's [what] a great sin,
see, the love of money.   I don't mean the money, the love of, of
money.   A person that love money so much, those folks, they don't
care nothin' 'bout me or you or [any] nobody else.   They'll kill you,
they'll take [you'll] your life for what little you done made an'
worked for.   I think that's one, one of the meanest things that
the devil can pound in a person's heart.
AL:     Do you think that people in business that get very, very
wealthy are in love with money?
BJ:      Ah, no, I don't, not, not if they spend it.   If they spend
it out.   I knowed a man in ah, in ah, in ah Florida was a lover of
money.   He died to prove it.   Hum-hum, hum-hum!   He wouldn't feed
hisse'f.   An' he had, oh, thousand and thousands of dollars in
his back yard, buried.   He loved it so much so that he wouldn't
let nobody else keep it.   He jus' [sat] there an' counted, days
an' nights an' counted it.   Wouldn't even let -- he died, so
the doctors say, for the need of food!   An' he wouldn't marry
nobody, [to] scared he would have to take care of 'er.   Ya see?
An' he wouldn't give nobody nothin', ya see what I mean?   So
he natchully loved his money.
AL:     Well [the Lord is very]...an ordinary person...
BJ:      Well, [he] now, he loved it to hisse'f that way that he had,
in that way; I don't care what [name they]
then done given it (?).   But a lot of folks will love it so much
that they mean with it.   If the devil with it, he mean with it.
An' they walk alongside you an', an' knock you in the head, take
your money.   Well, you, tha's just a bloody spirit, you know.
So, that's, I think that's the great sin -- one -- ['cause] co'se ah,
