Roll 57  Frank Proffitt  3

(frank)  I heared the story passed down, he helped her off the mare, and
had a jug of moonshine liquor hid in the bushes.  He helped her off, and 
offered her a swig of the liquor while she was sittin' in the shade of a
tree, restin' after a long ride.  And when she tilted her head back to take
a swig, he crammed a rag down her throat, or a handkerchief or somethin',
so nobody couldn't hear her scream.  Anne Milton came runnin' out and stabb
her about 3 or 4 times in the chest and the stomach with a big old knife
while Tom was holdin' her.  And they had a grave dug, they hauled her on
the mare to, a little shallow grave. . . .and I'll just get off of the sordid
stuff and get on down how my greatgrandmother, . . .they had his trial and he
was convicted after appealin' it 2 or 3 times throughout 1866 and they
continued it during 1867 twice.  They moved it from Wilkesbury (?) to
Statesville, Governor Vance did, ex-Governor Vance was defendin' him.
Anyway, he was convicted and hung on May 1, 1868, and my greatgrandmother
went to his hangin'.  She said she heard him singin' this on his way
to the gallows, this song, this way. . . .the way it was passed down thru
my family.  And it must have sounded pretty pitiful. . . .but I'm gonna go
ahead and sing the ballad, in my own way, the way if feels inside of me
to sing it, if I tried to do it like my father done, I'd just mess up. . .but it's
close, sounds old. . . .he done it in a different tunin' on the banjo. . . .some
strings. . . .(plays,)
