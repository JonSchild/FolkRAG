Dear Mr. Secretary;

    In furtherance of the development of our Archive
of American Folk-Song, Mr. Alan J. Lomax of our staff is
about to proceed to Haiti, sailing by the S. S. Pastores of
the Columbian Line on December 10. He will have to carry
with him certain apparatus, including a recording instru-
ment which is the property of the Library of Congress, and
will be brought back by him.
    It would be a convenience if he could be furnished
with a note form the Department to the American Consul, as
well as the Minister at Port-au-Prince, which would assure
him not merely ready admittance of the apparatus without duty,
but also any assistance he may require in making evident the
nature of his mission as scientific and in the interests of
the Library.
    If such a note can be vouchsafed, will you kindly
have it addressed to my care, and oblige
    Yours faithfully,

    Librarian

The Honorable
 The Secretary of State
  Department of State
   Washington, D. C.
