AL: Well, tell me about that. How did that all happen?

BJ: What you mean?

AL: Well, how did [it] you, how did it happen [?] that you had a child
at twelve? Was this your boyfriend?

BJ: It was a man Never have had a boy...Never have been courted
in my life...Never had a 'sire to. An' I ain't had yet. I don't like boys --
you see, I like 'em, but not for me. Always figure I...I don' know,
I musta been born a bull spirit or sumpin' or other. What I mean,
over that type of doin', I never liked no boys. You know, used to be
boys called (caught?) themselves cou[r]'tin girls, an' I watch 'em how they
co't girls. They shoved the girl around, you know, an' that kind
of thing, and, man, I said "Whoo!" Give me the fits; I couldn't
stand it. I said, I know you wouldn't do me like that, see? That's
why I didn't like no boy, see? A man walk a long with you, he talk

I was already at the gone, you see? Know what I mean. Jus' startin' I was already
gone. Well, it come from man. I run around an' tell people
about men. Man is tough on, on; they ruin the girls. You see?

I started to say, when I was that way, I didn't know it; I didn't
know what it was. An' Mama was puttin' a cosset (corset) on me;
they used to wear cossets, you know, one Sunday. She had went to
town and bought me a dress -- a beautiful dress, embroidery -- to 
wear that Sunday. An' I was goin' show my dress off that Sunday. 
An' I didn't know nothin' about nothin' bein' me (?), you know;
