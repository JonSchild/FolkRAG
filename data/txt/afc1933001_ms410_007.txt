Dear Sir:

We are in receipt of your communication of July 7th
and regret very much our inability to grant you the
privilege of reproducing "THE SANTA FE TRAIL" in conjunction
with your "Cowboy Songs" publication.

Contracts with composers prevent this possibility.
Secondly, it is not consistent with our policy to
permit others to reproduce our material in published
form.

Regretting our inability to be of service to you,
we are

Very truly yours,
J.J. Bregman
General Manager
ROBBINS MUSIC CORPORATION
