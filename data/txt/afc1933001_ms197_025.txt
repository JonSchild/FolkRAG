SUBJECT: Method of handling requests from commercial recording companies for master tapes

Following our recent discussion, I am writing to suggest
a new method of handling requests from commercial recording
companies for master tapes of records intended for public
release. In the past our practice has not been wholly consistent.
In the folk song field we have so far insisted that the recording
company get in touch with the folk singer and invite him to come
to the studio for commercial recordings intended for release. The
main reason for this was that our records usually made in the
field are very seldom of a quality good enough to be considered
for use in making commercial masters. The one exception was the
Jelly Roll Morton jazz records. In this case, after receiving a
court order instructing us to make copies available to Circle
Sound at their expense, we were asked to make the actual discs
for which we charged $15 a side with the result that the laboratory
did receive a substantial sum for the work. I should add however
that it was not very profitable because it proved to be a terribly
time consuming operation.

In the case of poetry recordings, however, our practice has
been quite different. First of all most of our recordings were made
in our studio and are at least acceptable if not always of "high
fidelity" quality. In the case of poetry, when we receive written
authorization for the copies we simply sold the recording company a
tape copy at our usual moderate prices for such tapes.

It seems to me that we might consider a new policy which would
involve two points. First of all, I think we should insist the
labels and jackets clearly state that the recordings were originally
made by the Library of Congress. In several instances, poetry
recordings made from our tapes were issued commercially without any
acknowledgement to the Library of Congress whatsoever. The other
point equally important is that we should try somehow to recover the
original cost of getting the recordings for the Library of Congress
collection. Inasmuch as it would be very difficult to ascertain the
actual cost in each separate case, I think that this would best be
handled by setting a flat fee for these recovery costs. We might
even consider an amount of $100 for each 20 or 30 minute side or if
