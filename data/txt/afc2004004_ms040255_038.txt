"Yarmouth Hornpipe". Again, at the
"King's Head" at Worstead, Norwich, you
will find a character in the landlord -
Elijah Flaxman. He, too, is a singer
of old songs as are one or two of his
"barmates".
     Yes, indeed, they are characters
and I'm both proud and happy when I'm
with them. If you are interested and
would care to call on them, I can
assure you that if you mention my name
you will be received most royally and 
will receive every kindness and help.
     "Songhunting" may be a bit removed
from my lengthy BBC work of beekeeping
and Norfolk dialect stories - nearly
eighteen years now - but one seems to
acquire the habit of looking for suitable
programme material.
     Again, many thanks, and with warm
regards,
Sincerely yours,
(signed) Rep. Gamble.
