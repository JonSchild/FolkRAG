Henry O. Tanner: THE BANJO LESSON

THIS is the first comprehensive
survey of the Negro in art. PART ONE deals
with the Negro As Artist, and gives a pictorial
review of the work of Negro artists
from the earliest Colonial pioneers to the
latest young contemporaries.

PART TWO, The Negro In Art, traces the
treatment of the Negro subject as a theme
in both American and European art generally,
emphasizing the changing attitudes
involved. It thus furnishes an important documentation of the varying social conception of the Negro as reflected in art from the period of early Colonial contacts down to contemporary times.

PART THREE, The Ancestral Arts, briefly illustrates the representative varieties and the principal regional styles of African art and indicates its influence on modernist art.

Brief critical introductions and extensive biographical notes on all the artists make this portfolio a study manual as well as a de luxe album of the best in the art of the Negro. It should thus be useful to students, schools and libraries interested in the study of the artistic and cultural contribution of the Negro, as well as to those artists, art-collectors and art-lovers, more professionally interested, who desire the first comprehensive collection of fine reproductions of the work of Negro artists and of the Negro subject in our art.

Alain Locke, the editor, is professor of philosophy at Howard University, and has for years written extensively criticism and appreciations of Negro and African art. This portfolio is planned also as illustrative material to parallel his highly successful Negro Art: Past and Present, BRONZE BOOKLET No. 3, which the ASSOCIATES IN NEGRO FOLK EDUCATION issued in 1937; a new edition of which is announced for January, 1941.
