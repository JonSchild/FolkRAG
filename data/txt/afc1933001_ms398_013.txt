If they could speak like you an' me,
They'd pronto make it plain
That they've got feelin's we can't see
Who hold the bridle rein;
So saddle them with gentle hand
And in the very start
They'll try to make you understand
The love that's in their heart.

Bur the cowboy must have his joke - even about his best beloved friend. So

and advertisement read in a western paper,

Lost, Strayed or Stolen

"One round horse, round as a ring,
A baldfaced horse, straight as a string,
Eight years old, nine in the Spring,
Left eye out, right eye glass,
Three white feet, a star of his class;
Head bulged out, behind caved in,
But a darned good hoss for the shape he's in."
