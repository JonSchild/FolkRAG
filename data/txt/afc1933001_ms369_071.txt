Bouki cracked them and when they had
picked themselves up they began to dance, 
looking over their shoulders. Then the lion
roared. He shook the house. When Bouki
saw his bushy head (looking out) stick out from beneath
the bed slats, he sung out;
"Jump for the rafters."
And in a second all the Boukis
Papa, Mama (??) the nineteen
little Boukis were hanging from the rafters
by their hands. The lion sat down below with 
his mouth open and waited. Presently the
littlest child began to whimper.
"Papa, (I'm getting) my hands are
getting tired."
"Let go and get a fresh hold," said
papa Bouki.
The lion swallowed Bouki's littlest
child without even gulping. Thus one after
another Bouki's 19 children went down the lion's 
throat until Monsieur and Madame Bouki
were hanging by their hands, childless and alone.
