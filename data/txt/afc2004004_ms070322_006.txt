London - Feb. 27, Tuesday
I'm very tired. Spent the 
day working on the final BBC
broadcast - a panorama of America
with songs. I'd done it before &
it sounded tired to me, but
actually it had a lot of eloquence
or I no one else could have done 
it.
Ended up 10:00 very tired &
wishing I had never come. Robin
got telephone calls & I was very
jealous. Then we went to the
Mandrake Club to find the
empty chatterers all assembled
again in the smoke. The gaptooth
Colin Davis forced me to sing
and I forgot words, sang
badly and [I] was furious
at the end, quarrelsome
