Tape: #892 Nimrod Workman
Nimrod:... Matty Groves and Lord Daniel.
AL: Where does that song come from?
Nimrod: I don't know. I've heard that song ever since I
was a kid. I don't know where it really did come from, but
I think it was like a ... handed down from England... that's
where I understood it came from. Handed down from England.
AL: You think it's a true song?
Nimrod: Yeah, Lord Daniel, he was a great warrior (?) you know.
It was pretty well a true song I think. (he sings)

"Well, first to come down was dressed in red,
Next come down was green,
Next come down was Daniel's wife,
Fine as any queen, queen,
Fine as any queen.

Well can I go home with you, little love,
Home with you this night?
I can tell by the rings you wear
That you are Lord Daniel's wife, wife,
You are Lord Daniel's wife

And the little foot(path) was standing by,
Heard every word was said
If I don't die 'fore the break of day,
Lord Daniel shall hear of that, that,
Lord Daniel shall hear of that.

Well he had about sixteen miles to go,
8 of them he ride
Rode til he come to a broken down bridge,
Fell to his breast he swum, swum,
Rattled on the door and he rung.

What is the matter, my little footpath,
What is the matter now?
'Nother man's in bed with your wife
And both of their hearts in one, one,
Both of their hearts is one.
