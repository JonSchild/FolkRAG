Mr. H. C. Darnell

Camden, N. J.

Dear Mr. Darnell:

This morning I talked with Mr. Robert Gordon, one 
of the leading authorities of Folk Songs in the United 
States of America, and he told me that Rosamond Johnson 
told him that he (R. J.) had picked up the refrain of 
" Didn't He Ramble" in Jacksonville, Florida.  This 
tallies with W. C. Handy's statement, with my father's 
testimony that he has known the refrain " Didn't He 
Ramble " all of his life and I now can present you with 
a printed version of the Ram of Darby with the " Didn't 
He Ramble refrain dated 1888.

The reference is p. 157, No. 5 of Publication 
of the Texas Folk-lore Society.

To recapitulate.  L. Rosamond Johnson picked up the 
Didn't He Ramble refrain and wrote new lyrics and a new 
melody for the stanzas.  2.  The Didn't He Ramble refrain 
had been for a long time been current as the chorus of 
the obscene ballad about the Ram.  I can furnish you 
versions of this from Texas, Kentucky, and Michigan, 
all dated before 1900.
