Any form of dance may be used, but the footwork is important.  One
form of a dance to do would be to step out on the heal on "shortenin',
shorteninâ€™ etc." and then step in on the whole foot.  The toe is
pointed at the beginning of each verse for this dance.  It can be
done in a circle (actually a square) by four dancers, by two dancers
side by side, or in lines.

* An alternate last line is "Somebody peed in Mama's bed."  BJ advises,
"You don't say that, though."
