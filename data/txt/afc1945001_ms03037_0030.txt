#5 -- Missouri

many theorists back there and not enough real technical
experts. That's what is the matter now in this synthetic
rubber row. They don't know what they're doing back there.
It would be cheaper for the public to hire real brains than
to rely on dollar-a-year men who can't get the job done.
  Liberty, Missouri, August 6 ---- People are plenty
disgusted over this synthetic rubber deal. One big shot
in Washington says one thing one day and the next day another
big shot says something else. They don't know their ear
from their elbow. Somebody with a big stick better take
charge and get the job done or they will have a fight on
their hands if they try to take tires away from people. 
  Kansas City, Missouri, August 7 ---- Defense plant
workers are being pampered by the administration, paid big
wages and overtime as a part of the administration's poli-
cy to keep labor placated.
  Kansas City, August 7 ---- Donald Nelson has bungled
the synthetic rubber program, failed to get expert opinion
and contributed to widespread public confusion and irrita-
tion. Why doesn't Roosevelt delegate more authority to
people who can get the job done instead of trying to run
the whole show himself.
