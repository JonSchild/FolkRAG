[*Blues - sung over mom's [? ? ?]*]
Vera Hall, reel 11, page 1.

About Blind Jesse--not taken entirely--
A: What is the main reason people sing?
V: When anybody sings the blues, it's just some blues that
fits yo' case. Just like if t is man that I go with in
Tuscaloosa--I like him pretty well--well, if I goes back
home and somebody tells me he's been  comin to see somebody
else, you know? or somebody tells me he's been making trips
up there and was out, maybe, carryin' somebody else aroun'--
I like him, what I'm tryin' to get after-- well, that would
hurt him, you know, for him to do that and maybe I'd be feelin8
awful bad, if I'd get at home there today and hear that tonight,
tomorrow I'd be awfully blue on the job thinkin' about it,
so I would sing kinda hum around and sing a little. That's the
onlt thing that would consolate me. Well, now that part of
life will make a person sing, will make me sing. And I
won't have much appetite, ruther do that little singin' and
I8d ruther continue to work than to stop and eat. Seem like
I get along better just continually do something all day
and it's because I'm kinda worried about what he done.
A: Whatwould you sing on an occasionlike that?
V: If you in love with a man, it's just bad for him to mistreat
you. It-it just hurts. And I know a woman's just cried just
like somebody was dead just because her frienddid something like
that. And you just sing some kind of blues, sumpin like
Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always
Babe, the sun gon shine, babe
In my back do some day.
