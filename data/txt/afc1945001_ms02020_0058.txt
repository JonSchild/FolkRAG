The dentist, Labor union official, Chamber of Commerce official,
and the drug-store owner commented that there is a noticeable
lessening of rumors within the past two months. They attribute 
this to a greater awareness of the War on the part of the public
and because there is a marked decrease In anti-British feeling.
The labor union official is of the opinion that news stories and
news reels telling what the British are doing to help win the War
have stopped much criticism.

There is no doubt that, the rumors have decreased since the last
rumor reports were made. There is a noticeable change. it is our 
belief that the continued campaign of "Button your lip"; "If you
must talk, tell it to the Marines," etcetera, has done much to
drive home the value of secrecy. The "first-hand" information that
one may hear from people returning from Hawaii is serious thing
and it may be that returning people could be double impressed with
the value of silence.
