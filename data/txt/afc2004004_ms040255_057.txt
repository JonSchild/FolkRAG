of Jimmy's most recent letter. 
And while I think of it, 
here's Willie's full address: 

William Matheson, 
c/o Macpherson, 
Castleton Cottages, 
King Edward, 
Banffshire. 

Bert Lloyd wrote me the 
other day, asking for collier's songs 
and saying he'd seen you in Paris. 
All the best 
Hamish 
PS
I'll try and assemble some 
photos for you. But is this a 
thing I do 'pour les beaux 
yeux de Columbia' - or do you 
pay me anything?
