"He was a good singer, too. He called his horse "Doney
Gal," his sweetheart. None of us ever saw him again."

[We're alone, Doney Gal, in the wind and hail,
Got to drive these dogies down the trail.

We'll ride the range from sun to sun,
For a cowboy's work is never done;
He's up and gone at the break of day,
Drivin' the dogies on their weary way.

A cowboy's life is a weary thing,
For it's rope and brand and ride and sing;
Yes, day or night in the rain or hail,
He'll stay with his dogies out on the trail.

It's rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are on the go,
Yes, rain or shine, sleet or snow,
Me and my Doney Gal are bound to go.]
