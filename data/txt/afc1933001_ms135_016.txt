Dear Alan -
Received the song material in ship-shape. Thanks.
If there is any further material you would like me to send you,
simply say the word. Possibly, you might let me have some franked
envelopes which, I fully understand may only be used for official 
business and which I would use only to send you material requested.
I am sorry about the song-list. I was under the impression
that Esther Peterson was going to send that to you. She
has been away the past ten days, returning tomorrow I hope, and so
I had no idea that had not been done or I would have attended to
it long ago. Enclosed you will find such a list - not skilfully
arranged, incomplete in a number of details such as dates, etc.
which I have not had time to track down.
Miss Carter has promised to ship the bathrobe. I gave
her your Washington address. Let me know  if she needs reminding.
I leave Bryn Mawr on the 25th of this month for the Southern School
for Workers. I'm not sure of the address yet, but I believe it is
in or near Asheville, N.C. It would be splendid if you should happen
to be in the neighborhood and drop in. Ditto for Chicago, after
September 1st. I am looking forward to meeting Charles Seeger. If
he's anything like Elizabeth and yourself, he's O.K with me.
Sincerely,
Bill Wolff
