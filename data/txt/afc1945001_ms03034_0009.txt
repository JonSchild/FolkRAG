OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION

June 27, 1942 

Dear Mr. Knapp: 

Thank you for your letter of June 24. 

I have been much interested by your "morale warden" 
plan and should greatly appreciate your sending us whatever 
summary reports you develop from the responses to your questionnaire. 
We appreciate your generous offer of the panel 
for our use, and whenever the need for intensive material from 
the Boston area presents itself, you may be assured that we 
will call on you. 

Thank you for asking Miss Sweeney to send us the 
reports of the American Irish Defense Association. I look 
forward to reading them. 

Sincerely yours, 

R. Keith Kane
Assistant Director
In Charge, Bureau of 
Intelligence
