     He says, "I do."  He said, "But I'm not lodged at your
house no more an' I ain't gonna go there."
     "I don't care what nobody say, you come to my house!"
     He said, "I ain't gonna do it."
     You see, she was goin' with a chain gang boss, a white man,
see?  An' that man tol' him if he catch 'im there again what he
gonna do to him.  See?  But yet she was gittin' one out the white
man to take ker of him.  See?  She sure was.
     An' he said, "I ain't goin' to your house no more."  He
said, "An' I don't think I'm gonna bother with that nohow.  I'm
gonna take care a myse'f.  I like that."
     An' she tol' 'im, "You ain't got to work.  You ain't got to
hit a lick at nothin'."
     He was out this world.  That was a good-lookin' man, tailor-made
from A to Z!  That was a man, ya hear?  I said, 'cause I
said to myse'f, "That mus' be him," when I walked in the
door.  An' there one mind said, "I hope it is him."  That was a
good-lookin'. . .That was a cat, hah, I'm tellin' ya!  He was a 
cat, I'm tellin' you!
TL:  That was the piano player, huh?
BJ:  Yeah.  Yeah, that was him, um-hum. An' so.  I wen' on an'
I listened; I heard what he said.  Then I could talk with him.
I knew I could talk with 'im then.  If I'd a-heard him tell her,
"I don't mean nothin'; I'm jest down here d --"  Some kinda mess,
ya know, kinda throw-up, I'd a-send him out a the house when
I got back in there, see?  But I eavesdroppin' an I heard how
he talkin'.
     He said, sh-- "I ain' never even talked with her.  But if she talk[ed]
[with Susan] to suit me, I'm sure comin' to see her."  Said,
"If she don't, I'm git' somebody else."  He sure told 'er.
