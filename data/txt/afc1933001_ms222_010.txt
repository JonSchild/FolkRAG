I'm disappointed.  Therefore here
is your round trip air mail
ticket.  Come on if you can
stay only one day.  I shall
tell no one you are coming and so make you
my Christmas gift to [Dennis?]

me when you get to [D?]

for you.
Lovingly
Father
Send me a "strictly [?nd]"
letter c/o of the Republic Bank just
as soon as you find [?]
