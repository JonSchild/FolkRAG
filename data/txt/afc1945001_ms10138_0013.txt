M. COLORED.

I.
You can tell what branch of the service a
baby will join when he grows up. Put him
on the floor & put a toy battleship
on his right side then put a plane on his
left side, if he grabs the battleship he
will be a sailor, if he grabs the plane he
will be a pilot, but if he grabs his
nurse you will know he will be a marine.

II.
One sailor said to another, I joined the navy
to see the world.
The other sailor replied; yes, what's
left of it.
