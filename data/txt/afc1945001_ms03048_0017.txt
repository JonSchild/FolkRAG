Rumor Report - Second Section
KOB 7/31/42 and 8/5/42

In accordance with your letters of July 31 and
August 5, there is enclosed herewith the Second Section of
our Rumor Report, which includes rumors heard up until 
noontime today, August 15, 1942.
On the First Section of the Rumor Report which
was sent you yesterday, on Page 11, the next to last
paragraph should read:

"In addition to the rumors listed as of August 3
to August 6, we picked up many in regards to the trial of
the eight saboteurs. We feel that, in light of subsequent
events, these rumors can now be entirely discounted."
