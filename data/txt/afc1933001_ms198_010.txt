Dear Rae;
      I am quite disturbed about the time element involved in getting copies 
of the tapes of Texas Gladden and Robert Smith. As I mentioned in my previous 
letters, it is most important that these records be made at once.
    Regarding the Laboratory fee, I wonder if there wasn't a mistake made in 
the fee you quoted.  It is $150 an hour, or $1.50?  It does seem to me that the 
former is unreasonable.  I wish you would clarify this for me and let me 
know if there is any chance of getting the tapes soon.

                        Best regards -
                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Alan Lomax
