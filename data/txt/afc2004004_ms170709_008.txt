They said, "Would you ast huh to come out?" I had jes come from work an 
had kicked my shoes off.  I was tryin to git my shoes on but he thought I 
was too slow movin.  He got out of the car an he had his git-tar in his han. 
Lawd, I jes grabbed him.  He an me jes wrung one another.  He came on in.  He 
tole me bout how he had been treated.  Peo ples didn't act jes right about 
him since he had been out of the penitentiary.  The girls he was with they 
didn't take time to bother with him, fix his food an stuff.  I went on wid 
him then over to my sister-in-law's sister's house.  An we came back.  I tole 
him I said, "Well you don't have to stay theah.  I have thi s whole house 
heah alone.  You can jes come right heah an stay."  He on with those peoples 
an the next evenin he came back an told me, "I've come to stay." 
I said, "All right, come right on in."  H e stayed there an I went to work 
every day. When I came back he'd be there.  He'd clean the house an everything 
else he could do around there, you know.  Mmm-hmmm.  So then by the time 
time that was goin long all right Mr. Lomax wrote him an tole him he was 
comin by for him.  (laughs)  So then we never got away from each other no 
mo. 
(Was he thinking about you all those years too) 
It had to be or he wouldn't a come out lookin for me.  So he finally found
me.  From then on we jes never got away from each other.
H e was jes a wonderful person.  I think how peoples can brang up some 
little sumpin how quick you can git in trouble.  I was so glad when I 
got with him I didn't know what to do to try to keep him where he couldn't 
git in no trouble.
An I did. He jes got in this one little thing up heah in New York.  Now 
you know, it's hard for somebody jes to walk in your house an tear it 
apart.  When I left I had done tole the man, I said, "Lissen.  You go out 
an don't come back in here no mo."  So he left.  He didn't come back.  I guess 
he was lookin out of his window when I left.   An he went right back down 
there.  See, we was goin to a dance, but Huddie sposed to play next day.
