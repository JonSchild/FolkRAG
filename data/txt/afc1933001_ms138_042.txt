than a few lines.  While all begin
the way this does, it is possible 
then the original does not begin 
with these words.  Some sing 
& some write, I rather see all 
it as having been sung, etc. 
Of course it ends with a shriek 
or groan which must have 
sent shivers down the small 
backs of the children who
heard of it.  Fancy such a 
tale being told now to a 
child!
Thanking you for any 
aid you may be able to give 
me in locating the tale I am, 
Your truly, 
Anne Scott West
