Lomas: Tell me where you were born
DAVY: I was born at a place called Peterhead - that's in
Aberdeenshire.  1901, a place called Windmill, Street, Peterhead.
And my father, he did everything.  He hawked, he made tin, he
played the pipes for a living, but mostly hawking through
the country with a horse and cart.  My mother also, she went
hawking, too, and her father was of the Irish and her own
name was McGuire; and my father, he was Scotch.  He was born
in Aberdeenshire at a place called the Gorbals, that's about
twelve or fourteen miles from Aberdeen.  Well, when I was wee
boy I remember the days when I used to go with my bare feet,
begging, sometimes to farmhouses and getting some potatoes
and milk and bread and what we call oatcakes in Scotland.  Sometimes
I'd get a shot at the practice-chanter myself, and play
bits of tunes.  Then as I grew up, I went away mostly on my
own, on the roads.  I went to school in Aberdeen - started at
the age of four year old and left school.  I didnt go back
because there wasna much restriction in them days at school.
So I went away, mostly with other boys older than myself -
cousins of mine - I've often been alone with a cousin of mine
called Blind Robin.  He lives in Aberdeen now.  He's an old man,
a blind man.  He's a good piper and I used often to go along
with him to fairs and markets, and I used to lead him around.
Learned mostly all my songs off him.  He'd be a man about 70
now, stout man, blind, used to wear a kilt, play the bagpipes,
and then if he weren't playing pipes he was out gathering rags
and trying to make a living some way.
As I grew older I went away on my own, hawking, selling
writing pads, going to the moors of Scotland to get some heather
for making scrubbers for pots, and besoms for clothes and
sweeping out - brooms.  I've often made artificial flowers and
still to the present day I make artificial flowers very well.
And I can play the pipes myself, the accordion, sing, tell
stories - lots of different things.  Well, being a tinker or
traveller on the road, I mostly go to any farm-house or any
place - never be stuck.  Sing a song - anything at all for a few
coppers.  So, at the present moment I live in Dundee - settled
down now as I get older.  I'll be 57 on the 1st day of April,
and I've spent some useful times on the road, happy.
Well now, I often go away when I'm at home for a Saturday
night's playing up to Aberdeen -- catch the football match
there and get a few shillings - and then go round the town at
night playing picture hall queues, go to the public houses
to entertain people.  The best of the lot is along with the
farm servants.  I always like to be in the bothy along with
the farm servant ploughmen because I do alot of Scotch bothy
ballads to them and old songs, and they like to hear you
singing.  Crowds around me at night and they tell me to go on
and sing another song, when I get tired I justo stop and
