Dear Alan:
Thank you for your reply to my letter
of inquiry. I had an idea that the texts
you have did not differ greatly from my
own. I am interested in the West Indian
folktale versions which you mentioned. I
shall greatly appreciate your sending me
copies of these as soon as it is possible
for you to have them transcribed.
Again my thanks and good wishes.
Sincerely yours,
Paul G. Brewster
