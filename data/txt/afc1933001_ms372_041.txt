By ELMO SCOTT WATSON

RECENT news stories about the
progress of the government's
Missouri Valley Authority flood
control and irrigation program
lends interest to the reissue of
this biography of Capt. Grant
Marsh, steamboat pilot, which,
first published in 1909, has be-
come one of the classic accounts
of the exploring and military ex-
peditions which opened that re-
gion to settlement and made the
modern MVA possible.
    Marsh's river career began in
1846 (another appropriate reason
for republication of his life story
exactly 100 years later). At the
age of 12 he became a cabin
boy on an Ohio River packet at
Pittsburgh and for the next 63
years he was never long absent
from the waterways of the West.
    As mate of a wood-burning
sternwheeler, which plied between
St. Louis and New Orleans in
1858-9, he became the good friend
of a young pilot named Sam
Clemens. During the Civil War he
served on a boat which ferried
across the Tennessee River the
vitally needed reinforcements
which enabled Gen. Grant to win
the Battle of Shiloh and he later
performed similar services for the
Union cause on the Lower Mis-
sissippi.
    But the most interesting--and
most valuable historically--part of
the narrative tells of his career
as a pilot on the "Big Muddy"
from 1864 to 1881, during which
time he was intimately associated
with such frontier notables as
"Yellowstone" Kelly, "Liver-
Eatin'" Johnson and "X" Beidler,
and was a witness to or a partici-
pant in many a historic event in
frontier history.
    Outstanding was his connection,

From "The Conquest of Missouri."
Sitting Bull, as photo-
graphed by S. J. Morrow.

as pilot of the steamer "Far West,"
with the last expidition of the
famed Indian-Fighter, Gen.
George A. Custer. It was on the
deck of this boat that Curley,
the Crow scout, sobbed into the
unbelieving ears of the white men
the first news of the tragedy that
had taken place on the Little Big
Horn and it was the "Far West,"
skillfully piloted by Marsh, which
made the epic voyage from the
mouth of the Big Horn, down the
Yellowstone and the Missouri, to
Fort Abraham Lincoln and Bis-
marck, Dakota, bringing the
wounded survivors of Reno's fight
and the first complete account of
a defeat that was to shock the
whole nation.
    In fact, "The Conquest of the
Missouri" is not only a "must"
on the reading list of anyone who
tries to understand the con-
troversial "Custer's Last Stand"
but it is also an important source
book for the history of this whole
era in the annals of the frontier.
A latter-day steamboat captain,
Donald T. Wright, editor of the
Waterways Journal of St. Louis,
has contributed an introduction
to the new edition which repro-
duces in new form the illustra-
tions, mainly pictures by S. J.
Morrow and other pioneer pho-
tographers, that were an out-
standing feature of the original
edition.

Her Years Are Only Junes
Mrs. Richard Burton Writes an Amusing Autobiography

THREE PARTS SCOTCH. By
Guthrie Burton. Bobbs-Merrill.
288 pp. $2.50.

By E. DOUGLAS BRANCH

INSPIRED obviously by the title
of this mellow-tangy book
(which refers, really, to Mrs. Bur-
ton's lineage), the jacket writer
praises "a potent intellectual cock-
tail." Any tot old enough to lisp
knows that Scotch in a cocktail is
a barbarism. But there are no
gaucheries in Mrs. Burton's writ-
ing--urbane, amusing, graceful, is
this informal autobiography.
    The memoirist carries her dec-
ades gallantly, she speaks of her
kinship with Noah's Ark, for the
coquettish pleasure of being con-
tradicted; subduing the inevitable
heartbreaks of life, she makes her
64 years seem so many perennial
Junes. "Guthrie," born in Wyo-
ming Valley of Pennsylvania,
married to a barrister of Pater-
son, N.J., and after her widowing
to Prof. Richard Burton shortly
before that beloved man of let-
ters removed to Winter Park, Fla.,
has a sensitive feeling for place-
characteristics--and perceptive
antennae that flick lightly but
surely the personalities of many
interesting people. "So true!" the
reader will say of those he himself
has met, and "So that's how he
was!" of others.
    She knew Ambrose Bierce
underneath his icy exoskeleton,
his bruised idealism as well as his
heroic mold; Sinclair Lewis sat on
her lap for hours, while her leg
was needled with anguish; Wil-
liam Gillette claimed her plaid
topcoat to drape the great resi-
dent of 221-B Baker Street. To

her pleasant memory-gallery Mrs.
Burton adds little discursions on
her prejudices and predilections--
none unique, but all illuminant.
    She is an ailurophobe (benight-
ed woman!); but, of course, her
own cat is very special indeed,
having naught but genus in com-
mon with other sheath-toed crea-
tures. She despises mathematics
and deplores telephones; for her
most "New Poetry" induces urti-
caria, but as both a poet and a
scholar of prosody she may write
with assurance.
    Meet also the writer's daughter,
Jane, whose caul foretold her
clairvoyance; who in her seventh
year had the priceless infelicity to
select for her mother's birthday a
card with the message: "Thank
God you were born among us
while I was still upon earth." In
all, have a pleasant time.
