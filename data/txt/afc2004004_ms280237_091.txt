3) "Do you want any milk, sir?" pretty Betsy did say,
"Oh yes," said the squire, "Step in, pretty maid.
It is your fine body I much do adore,
Such love as I never endured before."
4) "O no, sir," said Betsy, "How can you say so,
In love with the milkmaid and in such poor clothes?
For there are fine bodies well  built up for you,
Not wed a poor milkmaid from the side of a cow."
5) Then a ring from his finger he instantly drew,
And right in the middle he broke it quite through,
One part he gave to her, as I have been told,
And they both walked together down blackberry fold.
6) As they were a-walking this young squire did say,
"There is one thing I warn you, my pretty maid,
If ever I force you in this open field,
The first time I force you, I will cause you to yield."
7) "Oh no, sir," says Betsy, "Pray let me go free,
I will have you now play no such game upon me,
I love my sweet virtue as I love my dear life."
And out of her bosom drew a long-handled knife.
8) Then out of her bosom this dagger she drew,
Andinto his body she pierced it quite through,
Then home to her master with tears in her eye,
Saying, "I've wounded the squire, I'm afraid he will die."
9) A carriage was fetched and the squire sent home,
A doctor was sent for to heal up his wounds,
His wound being dressed and in bed he did lay,
O Betsy, O Betsy, was all he did say.
10) Now Betsy was sent for, and shivering went on,
"I'm sorry," said Betsy, "For what I have done."
"The wound that you gave me was all my own fault,
So don't let such things stillremian in your thoughts."
11) Now a parson was sent for this couple to wed,
So happy they joined in the sweet marriage bands,
It's best to prove virgin, be you ever so poor,
And make you a lady ten thousand times o'er.
Lomax: Well, I'll be damned. They don't get any better than that.
Isn't that marvellous. The whole thing. Not a word missing. Well,
Harry, where did that come up from ? Under the grounds?
Cox: Buggared. . . I'll sing you another one, shall I? This here is more 
a farm song. This is the Rap-A-TAp-Tap song. . .
