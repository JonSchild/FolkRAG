The petits of Pont Beudet certainly know
the facts of life, if the chaille-o-pieds
songs they sing are witness.  The bawdiest
song I have ever heard [of] with a 
range of descriptive interests that is
frank enough not to be embarrassing
And these songs are shouted in loud 
and triumphant tones into the face
of all the world.  As a matter of fact
Revolie and others make no bones but
much flesh about saying that the petits
play sexually to their hearts' content,
but then with the approach of adolescents
the girls and boys sheer off from one
another and there are virgins at
25 here according to reports.  It's a matter
of practical economies in terms of the high
cost of children and responsibility -
Navvine who was here this evening, trembles 
with vitality, a delicious lithe
well-fed body - dances like a young
kid - narrow rounded hips - 
impudent in a jaybird's spirit
- a perfect gamin.
