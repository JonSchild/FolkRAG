Dear Alan:  As you and I heard
the Negroes in the deep South sing,
and as I continue to feel about
their singing, your own interpretation
is far more accurate and sympathetic
than your Golden Gate Quartette.  Their
Samson was machine-like and insipid
in comparison to your own
singing of the same song a week 
ago.  The Quartette had no feeling in 
their singing of that song. I venture
they didn't want to sing it.  No Negro
ever got religion and shouted over 
the two spirituals they sang.  They had 
zip and precision in their rendition
