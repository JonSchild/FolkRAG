A. LOMAX
I'm sorry.
CANRAY
Sweet potatoes and stuff like that.
A. LOMAX
When you were a boy-how long ago was this, about?
CANRAY
Oh, that's uhh. . .oh let's see, no less than-I'm sixty years
old and I was born and raised with that.  that was many
years ago.  Everybody had a-everybody would plant so many
acres of cotton, whatever they could afford to plant.  Like
if, like my daddy there, he was a sharecropper.  He had his
own team, so like if he made-he would give the third.  And
some people that had their own team, well, they would
sharecrop on half.  The bossman would furnish the team and
the feed for them horse or mules, whatsoever they had.  And
they would-they would divide it in half, but like my daddy-
like, let's see:  you make two wagonload, three wagonload of
corn, my daddy would get two and the landlord would get one.
And that's how I was born and raised up:  pickin' cotton,
gettin' corns and sweet potatoes.  They had a little bit of
everything in them times.  They didn't have too many
tractors and machinery.
A. LOMAX
Did anybody ever sing when they were working in the fields?
Did they ever sing like songs to help 'em work?
CANRAY
Uhh, not around, not around the house.  But it was so
unusual.  I remember like in the neighborhood like a man who
owned-the one my daddy was working for, them old fella
there.  If somebody would go and sing a song at night,
sometime they would go and visit somebody at night.  T'was
always on foot though, or horseback; something like that.
Man they didn't want to hear that old, that old, that old,
that old-they wanted to find out who was singing, or
whistling.  They was pretty strict about if you was working
