letters from the Library or from Governor
to help me along.  We have found 
more charming Negro ring
game songs.  Here, as I said, we 
are surrounded by treasures.
Mrs. Tartt is going to travel
with us for a week through
Alabama.  But Livingston will 
remain our headquarters until 
we get one more letter 
from you.  We'll move next 
to Atlanta Georgia.
We heard your last program 
in Northern Mississippi
in a roadside garage.  Excellent
I though except again too 
much tensions and feeling at
haste - as if some one was 
saying to you constantly "Hurry 
Alan, hurry." May I beg again that 
you sleep regularly eight hours
each night.  Lovingly, Father
