BJ TAPE 10, p. 11

AL: Steps.  Didn't they have different steps in Florida?
BJ:  Ah-ha, they did, they did.  But you know what?  I don't care, 
singin' -- dancin's just like singin'.  I notice, um, when some

that kinda thing.  Man, they'd, ah, was doin' the same then.  But
just the move, in the step.  So tha's jus' way it is 'bout singin'
the same way, I guess.  I know . . .
AL:  What was that other song that your uncle had, honey, that you
were telling me about?
BJ:  About how he used to pick the gitar an' make 'em -- an' make 
Aunt, Aunt, ah   -- Aunt Louisiana come back?  I can
pick, ah, that, too.  A lil' of it.  Ar, he used to sit down an
pick it, um, it go:
