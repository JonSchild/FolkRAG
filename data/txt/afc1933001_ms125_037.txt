Hyden, Kentucky

Dear Alan:

    Many thanks for your very interesting report. I
showed it to Mr. Vance just as he was leaving for Kansas 
City. He expressed great interest in it and, at
my request, wrote a note in your behalf to his sister-in-law, 
Mary Breckinridge. You may have already contacted 
her but I thought Mr. Vance's recommendation
would be of great aid to you.

    Please keep me informed.

    Sincerely,

    Acting-Chief,
    Division of Music
