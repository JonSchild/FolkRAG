Alberta*

This is an old song, says Lead Belly. [It is certainly
a] A favorite with him, I repeat[ing] the old complaint of a man
who is dissatisfied and lonely without his woman. The melody
Is distantly related to "Roberta" and the whole song a half-sister to [a more
generally known song about about Alberta:] the popular jazz-blues:

Alberta, Alberta,
Where'd you stay las' night?
Alberta, Alberta,
Where'd you stay las' night?
Yo' shoes ain' buttoned, babe,
[Clo's] Clo's ain' on you right.

* Pronounced "Alberda"
