in it. Then they have a swiming
pool, a nice sized one too. The
ground is just covered with flowers,
[lil] tiny yellow ones that grow
so close together that is looks
like a carpet of gold. They
have lots of [dr] wild ducks there
too, and, as the man won't let
any one shoot at them they are
almost tarne. The man let us
ride in the boat and we had so
much fun! If you would turn
Mary Ann and I loose in that
place we wouldn't come home for
a month! I must stop now and change
the water in the goldfish bowl. Love,
           Your youngest daughter,
