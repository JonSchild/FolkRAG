3. On Tuesday, August 4, five men were killed and two were injured, one fatally, in a plane crash at Columbia Air Base. On the following day a man on a Columbia bus was heard telling a man beside him that "That isn't the only accident they've had at the Air Base in the last few days. In fact, they've had lots of them they just haven't let people know about." [*South Carolina (Aug 3-8) 16*]
