Chain Gang Negroes           Page Nine

with an aisle between. The two chaplains, one white and one black, preach on
alternate Sundays. Probably because they are more easily controlled, nearly
all the road gangs I saw were made up of Negroes. Doubtless also, they have
better training and more physical endurance for such labor. I saw no examples
of discrimination in food or quarters between the two races. In Mississippi
and in Arkansas, Negro trusties with high powered rifles guard the other Negro
convicts, white trusties watch the white convicts.

Being more adaptable, the Negro convicts seemed far happier that the 
whites. Certainly they were easier to talk to. They were always willing,even
eager, to sing into my microphone. And some of their songs were touchingly
beautiful. As they sang in groups with resonant powerful voices, they seemed
to forget their plight, the iron bars, guards on watch with guns in their hands.
And when I played the records back to them, they would shout out their delight,
greeting with merry laughter some vocal slip of their companions caught by the
machine. At such times they seemed light-hearted, happy men. Perhaps, however,
as one of their songs goes,

"When you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' to keep from cryin'."

For indeed to the Negro especially, loss of liberty is a punishment not a method
of reformation. One singer complained,

"Well, de Captin called me a nappy headed devil,
Dat aint my name, it made me mad."

Describing the shifting changes of Chain gang life another song says,

"Some on de right of way, some on de farm,
Some on de Chain gang, some goin' home."

But the prevailing note of the long term man is

"On a Monday I got 'rested
On a Tuesday I was tried
On a Wednesday I got my sentence
On a Thursday hung my head and cried
I'm a chain gang man, aint got no home."
