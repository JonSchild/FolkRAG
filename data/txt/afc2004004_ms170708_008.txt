"My father had no learning. He could write his name -
that's all he could do - just put Robert Cox.  He went
fishin' for 17 years alongside an old skipper in Yarmouth,
he wouldn't write nor yet read.  Yet he learnt these
songs - and the different tunes they got now are all wrong.

1. On the 14 of November from Yarmouth we set sail
The wind being East - Nor' - East my boys, with a sweet & pleasant gale,
Until it did blow harder, the seas rolled mountains high
And at night when we did shoot, my boys, how dismal looked the sky
etc.

"The old fishermen made that - what they went through
when they were fishing.  That time of day there were
sails - not steam.  And it was hard.  My father didn't
get enough when they made it up at Xmas time hardly
to get home.  And there weren't no train ran; had to
walk home.  Well, they got a little spending money. Sometimes
they earnt nothing.  The weather'd blow'em about.
[*take ? perhaps a week to get anywhere, ? I hear*]
Sometimes it blows for a fortnight.  But I never did
hear him say he didn't like it.  He went as a young 
man, & they never come back to Yarmouth harbor till
Christmas time.  There was no running away.  They used
to take the fish out ferry them into the harbour, as the ship
lay outside.  Then off they'd go again. That's how it was then.
[*that was his life*] I've heard him say he'd be standing
there his eye full of salt water on open deck - 
just nowhere to get. Then - a ton of water over you!
Poof! Smothered head to foot. That was his life
But he took delight in it.
