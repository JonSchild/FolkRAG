STANDARD FORM NO. 64

Office Memorandum   UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

DATE: July 2, 1958

To: 
1. Mr. Gooch [*RDG*]
2. Mr. Rogers [*RDR*]
3. The Librarian [*LQM*]

From: Julius Davidson [*JD*]

Subject: Dr. Spivacke's proposal for increasing our revenues
from commercial recording companies

ADMINISTRATIVE DEPT.

Any reasonable method proposed by the Music
Division to increase the revenues of the Recording 
Laboratory would obviously have our approval. Since
there is no simple way to establish the actual cost of
recordings supplied for commercial exploitation, the
$150 seems to be as good a figure as any. I cannot
understand the reservation indicated by Mr. Stevens.
This is not normal reference service, but presumably
a business operation which should recover the costs.

CAL'S. OFFICE

I see no necessity at the present time for
establishing separate accounts to provide for a 
revolving fund within a revolving fund. We tried this
for several years on poetry and it merely complicated
the record keeping without even getting close to the
original objective of providing funds for additional
new titles.

RECEIVED
JUL 7 1958
LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE

We shall be more than pleased to make suggestions 
on accounting once the Laboratory pays for the 
many costs which are now charged to appropriated funds.

[*LQM: This subject came up at Ref.
Dept. [Division Chiefs] meeting with Cline & Spivacke
at which it was pointed out that the Library has been
exploited by commercial companies which have obtained
saleable material for practically nothing. I think
it is fair for us to recover some of the costs of this
operation when the  materials are being commercially
exploited.
RDR 7/3-
It is an interesting proposal. Let's
arrange a meeting to discuss.
