Dear Mr. Wheatley:

I will be in Washington on the 
31st, and delighted to follow the procedure
suggested in your letter. I am a little
confused by the second Frederick appearance
unless he plans to review books at that 
time. Could you let me know what he's 
going to say so that I can make my comments
make sense after his? The content you 
suggest seems to me all right. 

One question: do you want to
pick up theme from me in Washington at
the beginning? That's perfectly all right
if that's what you want to do. Thanks for
the invite. 

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
