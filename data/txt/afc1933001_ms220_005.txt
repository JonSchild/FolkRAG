Mr. Putman writes that the book measures
712 pages! They wont at this time print
more than 400 pages - the uncertainty of
the war, etc. I'm surprised that they are
willing at this time to print this sort of
book at all. With your assent (and
Mrs. Megan's) I think I will have
the manuscript sent on here. I'll indicate
where I think the cuts should
come and then forward it on to you
two. Tell me if all of Aunt Molly's
stuff comes out. And please reply to
this part of my letter soon.

We are putting your old
stuff and Johnny's in your room
for your disposition. I thought you
might wish the enclosed letter now.
That was a rare mother the good
fairies sent to you.

The Sharp's are as nice as
ever.

Lovingly,

Father
