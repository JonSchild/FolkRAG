way of life.  One of them is reported to preach sermons against formal
education: he points out to the congregation how much better things
were in the past, "when men and women wasn't out searching for idolatry
and education."  Another, is known to say, whenever he sees an educated
person walking into the church: "I may not know Greek, and I don't know
no Latin, but I know the Bible."  When asked by others why he makes such
a remark, he replied: "Have you ever heard of people in a community arming
themselves against a mad dog, well maybe I is just doing the same
thing."  Still another preacher is known to attack anything new.  Once a 
county agricultural agent tried to improve the quality of the hogs within
the area by new breeding, but to this the minister replied: "Blood
Don't Make Meat."
        In a feeble effort to stem this inevitable tide, some ministers are
adapting secular means.  But this causes conflict within the church.
Some of the members interpret these innovations to mean a decline in the
spiritual values of the church: especially is this true of the older
generation.  Matilda Mae Jones, fifty years old, reveals her attitudes
of disgust toward the changes.  She says:
         [*X*] 
            Songs they sing in church now feel like fire burning.
        What do I mean?  Well you know how fire burns: all fast and
        jumpy, and leapy like.  Well that's just the way these
        swing church songs are now.  Yes sir, most churches now call
        themselves getting on time or something the other.  Getting
        so some churches got people that don't pray like they used
        to.  Praying, I'm telling you, seem to be getting out of
        style.  Just now, they got the Lord's prayer set to notes.
        Long time ago people used to sing, rock, and moan.  Call
        that "rocking Daniel"; but now they only want you to rock
        when you rock up to put that money down.  They done put a 
        new touch on "Give Me that Old Time Religion", and now they
        got it in another tune.  They don't have time to bring up
