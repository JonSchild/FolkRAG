send on to Johnny, 
please.

Dearest Father and Deanie, 

CBS sent me over the enclosed letter in their
latest batch of fan mail, so I thought I'd send it on to you, not knowing
how to answer it myself. I feel sort of sorry for the lady; I wonder if
we are any relation to her?

Last night Mr. Sinclair and Miss Anderson and I 
went to a Texas Ex banquet and then on to the Fred Allen broadcast to hear
the winning Texas student. The boy did very well I thought, although I 
didn't enjoy the rest of the program too well. I think there are better plums
for the picking than Fred Allen. Dick Fleming was at the dinner, came over
and spoke to me and sent you his best and warmest. He certainly is a nice
man. He invited me over to his place for dinner and the evening some time--
an invitation which I think I'll take up soon. The only untoward incident
of the evening was that I called Miss Anderson "Mrs. Sinclair" by accident;
it comes very natural to me to say that because the Assistant Head of the
Music Division here, who works in our office, is a Mrs. Sinclair. I was
quite embarrassed by the whole thing.

This is theoretically a business letter being 
written during business hours and carried under a CBS stamp, so I guess I
must quit. This is my fan mail day and I hope to get off [several] twenty 
letters or so this afternoon. As always, my dearest love. 

Bess
