DINK

"I looked all over the whole corral,
Lawd, I couldn't find a mule wid his shoulder well".

      But Dink, reputedly the best singer in the camp, would give me
no songs. "Today ain't my singing day" she would reply to my urging.
Finally a bottle of gin, bought at the plantation commissary, nearby,
loosed her muse. She sang as she scrubbed the dirty clothes of her 
man, the pathetic story of a woman deserted by her lover when she needs
him most - a very old, a too common, a moving story; and with a refrain 
which Dink ended with a subdued cry of despair and longing - the sobbing

     "One o' dese days, an' it wont be long,
       You call my name an' I'll be gone.

       Now my aprons up to my chin,
       You pass my do' an' you won't come in.
       Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well!

       If I had listened to whut my mamma said,
       I'd a-been sleepin' in mamma's bed.
       Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well!
