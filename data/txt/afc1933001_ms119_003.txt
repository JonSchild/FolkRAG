Dear Mr. Lomax:

I received yesterday your two-page letter* from
Port-au-Prince, undated, but written just as you were departing 
for the north. Although you give your address there for the
next ten days, it seems better to address this to Port-au-Prince.

It is particularly to say that we approve your continuance 
into April, as you propose, leaving the exact date
in April to your own judgment. 

As to the camera, we are instituting an inquiry as
to cost and the possibility of purchase of one that might be attached 
to the Library, but shipped to you for temporary use.
Within a couple of days, Mr. Strunk or I will let you know the 
result.

With best wishes for the new estate,

Very sincerely yours,

*Libn has

Mr. Alan Lomax,
Box A 32,
Port-au Prince,
Haiti
