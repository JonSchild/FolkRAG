Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax,
The Railway Express Agency in Corpus Christi informs us that the copy of The Chisholm Trail which we sent you had not been delivered for the following reason: "Consignee not registered. No response to postal notice." Since our mail memo was dated June 13th, I cannot understand why the record did not arrive in time for your talk on the 20th.
We are instructing the Railway Express to forward the record to you at your Dallas address, to replace your worn copy, and hope it will reach you safely.
With best wishes,
Faithfully,
B.A. Botkin
Assistant in Charge,
