As for me I'll own all the
annual income from sales
or reproduction in literature manuals,
 royalties etc. You will be
left free to arrange for
radio reproductions, etc.

Such an arrangement will free your
hands in all radio and reproduction ventures
Also it will free you of debt
to me. You know my theory of the
psychology of such a situation. I
want us both relieved of that particular
shadow. While you are
writing on this subject tell me, in
case you harbor such a feeling, of
any instance where in your
judgment I have treated you unjustly
in matters of finance.

Affectionately,
Father
