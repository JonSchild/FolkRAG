At the end of that period, or in 1955, the minimum tax of 2c
per acre and an advalorem rate of not more than 1/4 mill will
probably be ample to take care of all levee requirements. 
This is predicted on the assumption that the U.S. Government
will continue its present policy of flood control.
The engineering department of the Levee Board is charged with
the proper maintenance of the levee and with the care of all levee
property, and with surveys and other details in the matter of acquiring 
rights-of-way, house moving, drainage and various other problems
incident to levee operations.
The engineers must in all matters cooperate constructively
with the Army engineers and lend their assistance to the end that
both the interests of the district and the government may be promoted.
The personnel of this department is now of course comparatively
small and it may be noted that its cost is much less than in former 
years.
In 1914 the item of engineering expense amounted to $30,157.02.
As may be noted by reference to the report, the comparable expense 
in 1940-41 amounts to $13,140.00
No statement outlining the activities of the Board would be
complete without reference to the Flood Control Act of August 18, 1941.
This set provides for the protection of the backwater area of
the Delta, the provision of a free-board differential of two feet in
favor of Mississippi over Arkansas and Louisiana, and further provides
that for future loop levees or set-backs the Levee Board will be reimbursed
the cost, to a reasonable amount, for the right-of-way.
Your Board and the Board of the Mississippi Levee District 
working with other interested organizations and our able representatives
in Congress has no small part in ironing out the controversies
that have for more than ten years existed between the interests of 
the Eastern and Western sides of the Mississippi River and in
