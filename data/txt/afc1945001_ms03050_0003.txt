SPECIAL REPORT ON RUMORS HEARD FROM  AUGUST 3 UNTIL NOON AUGUST 8, 1942
During the period covered by this report rumors heard in the
Columbia territory have been less numerous than during any similar period
since the United States became an active participant in the war. Immediately 
after Pearl Harbor rumors were so prevalent that as many as half a dozen 
could be heard within a twenty-four hour period. As time passed, however, 
there was a marked decrease in the number of rumors heard on the streets 
and those which were circulated were less fantastic than those heard 
during and immediately after December, 1941. 
Since August 3, six rumors have come to our attention and some 
of these have been heard several times in different sections of the
Columbia territory.
