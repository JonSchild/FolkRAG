World of Music
Suffers From
European War

Producers Hostile
To Americans in
Seeking New Field

By GLENN DILLARD GUNN

Our world of music is shrinking.
It suffers from undernourishment.
The sources of supply which 
have served us in the past, not
always to our advantage, are drying
up.

Europe Makes War, Not Music

Europe is making war, not
music. It can send us nothing
new and a great many of us are
tiring of the old.

When that condition arises in
commerce or industry, executives
seek new sources of supply. They
prefer to find them near at hand
and do not scorn to discover them at home.

Such sanity does not obtain in
the world of music. That is a
crazy world where millions are
spent at the bidding of a few
selfish men who have commercialized
all its activities.

Victims of Own Talks

They have been importers so
long, have preached European
propaganda so earnestly, that they
now find themselves victims of
their own sales talks. They have
no more European music or musicians
to sell and so vigorous have
been their protestations of European
superiority in music that they
can't sell the fine native product
without stultifying themselves.

They have sold us alien conductors
of symphony and opera,
men trained in the arts of other
lands, indifferent to the art of
this land, afraid that if they discover
a fine native opera or symphony
they will by that much
damage their own prestige.

Now Europe is no longer in a position to interest itself in the

examples of folk song. Purposely
they have not been defined as to 
source. But it can be asserted
with confidence that no Teuton,
Latin or Slav could have composed
them. The reader may amuse
himself by identifying them as to
origin. He also may compare
them with such German, Latin
or Slavic songs as he may know—
for example, "Holy Night" (German),
"O sole mio" (Italian), the
theme from the finale of Tschai-

choose, does his local duty first
and then goes farther afield, often
with good results.

Brahms. let me state that there
are no substitutes for these
geniuses and never will be. But
I have heard six performances of 
the Brahms first, and 10 of the
Beethoven fifth in the past year
and that's enough. The world of
music can't go on forever with
Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven
and Brahms, though they often 
seem to think so at the Library
of Congress chamber concerts.

The most individual of our
contemporaries
is Eric DeLamarter,
for 20 years associate conductor
of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Stokowski and the All-American
Youth Orchestra established
him as a humorist when
they played his overture, "They,
Too Went to Town," at their Baltimore
concert. This quaint piece
takes New England hymn tunes
as its theme and gives them brilliant
treatment.

Writes of Symphonies

It is DeLamarter's only adventure
with folk tunes. He has
written four symphonies of which
one bears the title, "After Walt
Whitman." It will do DeLamarter
little good to tell Washington,
Philadelphia, Boston or New York,
that Chicago received this work
with affection and respect and
that Kansas City endorsed it last
year. Yet all his music—he has
composed many suites and overtures—
are usually by reason of
their treatment of harmonic and
orchestral resources. DeLamarter
is a conservative modern with a
gift of melody that is intensely
personal. It is wistful, a bit aloof,
sometimes derisive, never sentimental,
often strong.

Another Michigan composer,
well known to organists but
ignored by most Eastern symphony
conductors is Leo Sowerby. Kindler
played his overture, "Comes Autumn Time," last season and
could repeat it with profit. He is
one of the few Westerners to storm
the Koussevitzky citadel in Boston
successfully and really needs no boost here.

Howard Hanson is not only a
gifted composer but he knows how
to promote his own works and
those of other Americans and uses
his influence unselfishly. Among
the older men is John Alden Carpenter,
who much resembles Taylor
and whose d e l i g h t f u l
"Perambulator" suite should be
heard here again. And, of course,
there's Roy Harris, whose admirers
are fanatical and whose op-
