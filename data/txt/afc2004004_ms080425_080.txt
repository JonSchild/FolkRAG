Tape: #225 Sacred Harp  p. 6

[*Roger*]
AL:  Tell me about the milk screener (?) one more time.
MR:  When you keep cows on the farm, you have a churn, and
you use this to strain the milk when you're milking
the cow, before it goes in the churn.
AL:  What about that lantern?
MR:  That was called a railroad lantern, I don't know why.
This one here was a more popular one than that one. . . .
(Nothing)
MR:  This particular area of this part of the country was
settled by small farmers, about 50 acres to the farm.
That way it made up a good community, you had people that
weren't movin' about, they were just on a small farm, they
tended the land themselves. They were more interested in
school and church, so it developed a better neighborly
community than if it had been a community where it was
large plantations. So we've had a community like that
all my life, and it still is predominantly that way here.
And we've always been near Alabama here, and we sing in
Randolph County. I know about as many people in Randolph
Alabama as I do in my home town!
AL:  And it's Sacred Harp all the way out there.
MR:  There's been Sacred Harp people all the way through
Alabama.
AL:  What about square dancing?
MR:  There was a lot of that goin' on when I was young,
my father didn't let me attend and I didn't get to do
much of it, I don't know why I got to attend a few.
It was a very popular sport, very popular.
