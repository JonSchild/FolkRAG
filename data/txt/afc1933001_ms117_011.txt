President, The Sound Specialties Co.
31 Beckley Avenue
Stamford, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Thompson:

    It is unfortunate that the shipment of discs to Alan Lomax
has been delayed but I hope that he has received them by now.
I have referred your last letter enclosing the cable, to the
Chief Clerk who will try to have you reimbursed for it in the
near future.

    We are trying to discourage the use of ten inch records
because of the difficulties involved in shelving two sizes of
records. In fact, we still have about fifty ten inch aluminum
discs from your last shipment to John Lomax and would like to exchange 
these for twelve inch. Will you please let us know if
this can be arranged and on what basis such an exchange can be
made?

    Very truly yours,

HS
