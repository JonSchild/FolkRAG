"Ever notice how many army jeeps are parked around these beer 
joints? Sometimes they try to hide them from view along these highway joints, 
but I see soldiers all the time bounce out of the beer joints and go hell 
bent for election down the road, all of them tight as ticks. Hell of a lot 
of rubber going to waste that way and how can those guys get away with 
getting all boozed up like that?" [*Salt Lake City 8-6  21*]
