And standard French doesn't exist, nobody speaks standard,
it exists in the grammar books, it exists in the
dictionaries, but every locality has certain expressions
that are more frequent than others.  You know, words that we
use.  For instance:  "lache".  We talk about when you let
something go you "lache" it.  That's a perfectly good word,
it's in the French dictionary and every Frenchman knows what
it means.  He doesn't use it every day, he going to "laissez
tombe" whatever it is. . .

Or "echappe".
TEACHER #2
Well, we also use "echappe".  But those words-it also is a
question of frequency of certain vocabulary.  You know, in
Minnesota they might carry their water in a pail, and we
carry ours in a bucket, but that doesn't mean we don't know
what "pail" means, and that we can't understand each other.

That's right.  And even from one community to another there
are differences of vocabulary.  For instance, our friend
Richard Guidry is from Gadon, and his daddy was a hunter and
a trapper and fisherman.  Richard spent a lot of time out in
the marsh.  Richard knows an awful lot ov vocabulary I've
never come in contact with, many nautical terms-what's the
word "to tie", "amare"?
TEACHER #2
"Amare"
TEACHER #1
Now what's the other standard French term "to make a knot"?
TEACHER #2
"Noue", yeah.

Some people in other communities wouldn't know. . .
