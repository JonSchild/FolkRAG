and under the able direction of Mr. Ford L.
Lemler, we are supplying films and records
to the public schools, service club, and 
libraries of the Inland Empire, including 
not only all of the state of Washington, but
also eastern Oregon, northern Idaho, and 
western Montana.
 
                We would welcome the opportunity
to act as the distributing center of films 
and music recordings of the Congressional
Library, if you desire that we serve in this
important capacity.
        
                               Very sincerely yours,
                               E. O. Holland
                               E. O. Holland, President
