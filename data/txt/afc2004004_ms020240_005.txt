[*CONFIDENCE IN PEOPLE*]

BJ:   At all. You got faith. An' then ya got to love yourself 
first before you come to anything. Ya got to first love 
yourself. You got to first have confidence in yourself before ya have it in
anybody else. If you don't love yourself, ya don't have confidence
in nobody an' no feelin' for yourself or none of that, ya can't 
have it for nobody else. Ya see? Because you, you just out,
yourself; you don't believe [in] nothin'. Ya hear folks say, "I
don't believe in nobody right." Well, he don't believe hisself
right. Ya see? He know he not right. So that' all. 

TL:   How do you come to learn that?

BJ:   Well, ya come to learn it th-through by self control, ya
know.  Jus' sayin' of yourself.  So, brother (??) -- Jus' say for
an intrance (instance) you say, well, ah, ah, ah, if somebody at the
house an' you got some, some valuable clo'es there or valuable
jewelry.  An' you -- an' someone says, uh, "You better not leave 
that here."  Ah, ah, an', "Do you leave your jewelry?"

Say, "Yeah."  You, you do that because you got confidence 
in yourself, ya see. Although that person may not be confidently,
but sometime you make folks have confidence in, in, you know, in
them because, they say, "Well, they trust me. An' ah, an' I want
them continue trust me." Ya see?

Jus' like I work on jobs an' I know people got fine jewelry
an' all that stuff around an' money throwed around, I don't want
jus' anybody to come in there.  You know, where I work at.  Because
I know that they got confidence in me, an' if somebody come in there
an' destroy it, why, they may think I say, ah, in they mind, they
lose faith, ah well, "Maybe she didn't git it," or "maybe" somebody 
will say, "Well, she told them to git it."  Or either, you know,
jus', it's jus' bad to have, ah, ah, ah, you know, to have somebody
