Dear Bessie:
I hope you can stay with me at least a couple nights while
you're in New York.  I have a spare bedroom.
I'll try again to get some records for you.  The other time
the company simply didn't reply.
The book Bess wrote has not been published yet.  Give everybody
my love, and I'll see you after Christmas.
Much love,
Alan Lomax
