KEEP MY SKILLET GREASY IF I CAN
I'm goin to my track,
I'm goin to my tra[k]ck,
Clean to my back,
I'm gonna mke them shiny if I can.
If I can, I don't care when,
I'm gonna keep my skillet greasy if I can.

In the town, walkin down the street,
And I chanced to have a meat,
I'm gonna make it shiny if I can.

If the po-lice holler Halt!,
I'm gonna run right back 
And grab a sack of salt,
And I'll keep my skillet greasy if I can.
If I can, I don’t care when,
I’m gonna keep the skillet greasy if I can.

My brother got mad at me;
I'm just as fat as I can be,
Cause I keep my skillet greasy if I can.
If I can, I don't care when,
