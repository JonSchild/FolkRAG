Dear Alan: CBS accepted your offer
[to f] and will pay $175 for a year's
use of material from our book on
their [sustaining?] program. Fine! I have
asked Macmillan to send you a
statement of what the overcharge is on
your text changes; Ruth's for music
changes. They will ask cash from
us. As soon as this item is settled I
will remit my balance due you
a/c Our Singing Country and CBS. I have as
yet not received payment. The book
goes well in Dallas.

Always I wonder why your
study of Philosophy and Mathematics
so poorly developed your logical
powers. Perhaps you just perversely
wish to disagree with me. You have,
you know, at times! At the end and always,

over
