Your special airmail to Shirley just arrived.  I opened it, 
assuming it was from you about the camp.  Am sending it on airmail, 
to General Delivery, Charleston, S.C.  You might write the Rosses or wire the
them what had to be done with the letter -nad why.  Maybe you'd better not
name the port in a telegram to the Rosses.  I could get along fine with Susan
She and I fir together well and your father is fond of her too. 
She mad good friends with Josephine's little girl, Barbara, and Virginia is
fond of her too; so any time your father and I had out of town business 
that would prevent our taking her, we could leave her with on of these
or take her to MRs. Mansell.  I do hope Shirley can make it.  As for the
money part and your father's helping, I just can't say.  I'll wait to mail
this until he wakes up.  It would be [w]ell for Shirley to have that information
with this same letter.  I seem to remember that he offered last 
summer to send Patsy to camp because he thought she needed it, but of course
 our finances are much more limited this summer.  This next is my personal
and confidential opinion:  if Patsy goes to camp with Shirley and you
I think it would be much better for her to be under some one els's 
supervision.  She is smart enough to take advantage of her mother's 
presence, - I mean she knows that her mother is not as so strict a 
disciplinarian when they are not at home, because she doesn't want to stir
up a fu[s]s in front of other people, and Patsy takes advantage of that fact
I think Shirley realizes that too, but if Patsy c[o]uld be just one of the 
children, as I imagine she would be, it w[o]uld be better for her and for S.
