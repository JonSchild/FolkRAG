[*(FISH FRIES)*]
       Ah, we have great fish fries.  Days [that] we'd be off; some
times, [an'] we don't wanna go to work; we all get together, a crowd
of us -- who want to, ya know -- friends together.  An' go out
on the, on the cannells (canals) an' have great fish fries.  That's
[the way it is.] really nice.  [Now they'd] Fish awhile, catch the fish,
clean im' while he's livin', ya know?  Ho, Ha, I mean!  And, ah. . .
TL:    Sure tastes good.
BJ:    I'm tellin' you.  And, ya know, sometimes ya wouldn't wanna
fish, my husband would take the net and just dip down, one time,
and got enough to do.  He'd catch them big, ol' perch runnin'.
He'd jus' throw that net out there an' bring up some fish.  An'
we'd jus' set out there.
       An' the white peoples that we lived with, sometimes they'd
wanna go with us, an' we all would go out.  She fix up everything
that night an'. . .oh, that she'd think we'd need.   Next morning,
early, we'd go out.  An', oh, boy, we. . .Her husband was a kin--
He's a very fine white man.  I never seen such a. . .guy.   An' he. . .
old fella.  An' he would, ah, couldn't see good without his
glasses, [jus'] like myse'f, an' he'd take his glasses an' look at
the fish:   "What kinda fish is that, George?   What kinda fish is
that, now?"   We'd have a lot of fun.  'Cause we'd catch them ol'
stray fish [that] done run out a the salt water, run in that, in that
water an' got lost.   Ah, ha, ha, he looks funny when he stay in
there a long time!   Ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha, hu!   But we'd catch
some fish an' then we'd have a big time on the water.  An' eatin',
I'm tellin' ya.  Then another. . .
