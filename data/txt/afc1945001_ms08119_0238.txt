I Heard a rumor that all beaches
would be closed this summer be-
cause there wouldn't be enough men for
life guards + that the defense factory is
using the water for defense and a thru
that there is a chemical (poisonous) in the
water.
I also heard a rumor that people
should not invest in war stamps because
maybe if we lose the war well then
I aslo read an article in the paper about
a former general of Hitlers army had
a niece which hitler liked but the
niece like her piano teacher which was
a jew. Some how or other hitler found
this out + killed the jew the niece +
the general.
Also I heard that food is rationed
because of the stortage of tin that
is needed now a days
