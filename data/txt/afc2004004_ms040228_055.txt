THE BARD OF ARMAGH

O list to the strains of a poor Irish harper,
And scorn not the strings for his old withered hand;
Remember his fingers could move once more sharper
To raise up the memory of his dear native land. (emblem,
'Twas long before the shamrock, our green isle's loved 
Was crushed in its beauty 'neath the Saxon's lion paw,
I was called by the colleens around me assembled,
The bould Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.

How I longed for to muse in the days of my boyhood;
Though four score and three years have flitted since then;
Still it gives sweet reflection, as every young joy should;
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of owl men.
At a fair or a wake I could twist my shillelagh,
Or trip through the jig wid my brogues bound with straw,
And all the pretty maids in the village and valley
Loved their bould Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.

Although I have travelled this wide world all over,
Yet Erin's my home and a parent to me;
Then, oh let the ground that my old bones shall cover
Be cut from the soil that is trod by the free.
And when Sergeant Death in his cold arms shall embrace me;
Lo, lulled me to sleep with sweet Erin-go-bragh;
By the side of my Kathleen, my young wife, oh place me
Then forget Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.
