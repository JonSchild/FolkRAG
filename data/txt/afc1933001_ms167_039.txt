New Orleans music*]

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The senior class in Art Education at Pratt Institute
is presenting a New Orleans sequence in a pageant to be
given at the Eastern Arts Association Convention in April.

For the background music, we would like some authentic
folk music of New Orleans on records. Would you please
suggest music you would consider authentic and appropriate
for a Mardi Gras scene. Could you tell us where we can
get the records, their cost, and whether it is possible to
rent them?

Also could you inform us about copyrights in reference
to the records you suggest? Is there any restriction in
the use of these records before a non-commercial audience
with no admission?

We will appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.
Thank you very much for the information.

Respectfully
Margaret Kennard
