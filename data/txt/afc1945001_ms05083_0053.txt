"Letters are being written by soldiers who are consiously or unconsciously 
sympathy seekers who write how tough conditions are so that they will have the sympathy 
and admirationof the recipients of their letters for the tough things they have to
endure.  A lot of rumors get started that way about conditions at the camps."  Same
as above.  [*8-8-42 Iowa 8*]
