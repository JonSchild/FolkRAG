Rosedale, and they sent me to Parchman.  And I went to
Parchman, man, and that's whens the trouble just begin.
They gone left.  I got something down there at Lymon, I stayed
at Lymons awhile.  They needed somebody to carry water up
there on the highway, up there.  Between, --no more than- uh,
Drew, right off a Drew and Rome, between Drew and Rome, you
know where that's at.  And, man, they put me behind a plow
drivin a white mule --you better not hit a white mule, better
not put a spot on it. (laughs)

A.L.:
What would happen?

J.S.:
You go back to that camp.  They swell your
behind up (rubbing his behind). (laughs)  And they, ah ,that
mule -he was contrary.  The Sargeants had pity on me, you
know.  That mule would  take me and lead me all across that
field, anywhere he wanted to carry me, boy --and I couldn't
hit 'im.  I wanted to hit 'im so bad, I was scared to hit 'im.

William S. Hart:
He had a leather line?

J.S.:
Yeeeaah!  --had a leather, he was wore --he
wore rope lines, all rope lines.

W.S.H.:
I thought he had a leather line. . .

J.S.:
No - we had them old plow rope lines.  But I
just couldn't. . .

W.S.H.:
Leather line throws back -hit im up under
the. . .

J.S.:
I just couldn't hit 'im.  I was afraid to hit
'im.  I better not have to hit 'im, every time I go in, in the
evening, (that day noon?), they check 'im --they have a
'spect at it -check 'im- see if I had a whip on 'im.

W.S.H.:
Well, ain't have none on his back. . .
(laughs)

Walter Brown:
Hit 'im on his ankle.  Hit 'im on the ankle.
Right between his shoulders.
