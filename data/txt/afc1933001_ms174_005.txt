Dear Harold,

We decided to come on back to Fisk University and work on the development of 
our field method a couple of days, rather than to spend any more time in the
actual recording at this moment.

We have made some extremely good records and the Model Y recording machine
performs nobley. We'll probably leave here on Saturday and after four or 
five days of recording in Western Virginia, we'll be in Washington--I hope 
about the tenth. I will return here on the twentieth for two days of work
with the students who are going to carry out the survey, and then we'll
leave the Fisk people to carry out the project until the last week of October 
when I'll take the machine into Coahoma County for a final two or three
weeks of work.

I was delighted to hear of Mrs. Shwartz's appointment, but sorry to learn
that you had forgotten my request that she be set to work straightening my
files, and putting my papers in order. I believe she has enough to do to
keep her busy until my return, and I think that she won't get very far with
cataloging the records without my assistance. I hope you will find it possible
to let her drop the cataloging project until I can get there so that the 
work will not have to be done over again.

I hope by this time the trip for John A. Lomax and Ruby Jackson Tart has been
initiated. They are anxious to go to work and the longer we delay, the harder
their problems will be, as the weather grows worse.

Enclosure 1 -- The enclosed letter from Doty at the University of Texas refers
to the field trip which I have suggested for Brownie McNeil. It seems now
that they will not need to borrow our equipment but only want records from
us. Perhaps we could send them 150 records for their field use in recording 
the Mexican songs along the border of South Texas. He has plenty of material
to keep him busy all winter long. I know you'll be amused to see our delicate 
friend from recreation going down to Texas. He'll have a hard time I fear.
