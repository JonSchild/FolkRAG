Dear John:
    I have just read your article on "Will Hogg" in the May issue of the ATLANTIC.
'Tis a fine job you have done, "mw lad." You have drawn a beautiful picture of an out-
standing, dynamic character who was mellowed and made lovable with the human frailties
which of course were undertoned. Any one who knew not Will, after reading your article,
will lay it aside with the thought that there was a real man. I will have to make a
confession however. In reading the article, several times I had to pause while I cleared
my throat and cleared my glasses of moisture which had accumulated thereon. Each time I
did it, I used language of which Will would have approved, cursing and damning you
for stirring up within me most unmasculine emotions which boiled up and out of me.
    Your friend,

Dear Mr. Lomax,
    When my ATLANTIC came yesterday I glanced at the contents to see if there
be anything I was particularly interested in. There was,-- and I read it without
further ado.
    I want to congratulate you. It is a fine bit of writing, and I realize your
heart was in it. It is very complete and to me very moving. I knew Will Hogg just
casually, never more than a greeting and a handshake. But of course all Texans know
of him, and I think you have painted an excellent portrait of a man. I have to hand
it to you,- you can write!

    Sincerely yours,

My dear M. Lomax,
    I have just read your portrait of Will Hogg in the Atlantic Monthly and want
to congratulate you on this fine and moving piece of writing. I, too, had to wipe my eyes
when the Houston newsboys sent the ties to New York.
    Accept my congratulations also to you and the Folk-lore Society on your elec-
tion to the presidency for the coming year. I am pleased to be a member of the council
and am looking forward to an unusually good meeting in San Antonio next year.

    Sincerely yours,
    Mabel Major
