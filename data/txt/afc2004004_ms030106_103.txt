1658

This is about one of the earliest blues. This is no doubt the earliest blues that's a variation from the real barrel house blues. The composer was Buddy Bolden, the most powerful trumpet player I've ever heard or that was known.
The name of this --it was named by some old honky-tonk people while he played this they sang a little theme to it. He was a favorite in New Orleans at the time: -

I thought I heard Buddy Bolden say,
"Dirty, nasty, stinkin' butt, take it away,
Dirty, nasty, stinkin' butt, take it away"
Oh, Mr. Bolden, play.

I thought I heard Bolden play
"Dirty, nasty, stinkin' butt, take it away,
Funky butt, stinky butt, take it away"
And let Mr. Bolden play.

Later on this tune was -- I guess I'll have to say stolen, by some author I don't know anything about --I don't remember his name-- and published until the title of "St. Louis Tickler." There was all the proof in the world that the tune was wrote by Buddy Bolden, plenty old musicians know it. Oh, this stuff is no doubt about 1902.

Well, I tell you, Buddy was the most powerful man in the history. Why Buddy Bolden would play sometimes at most of the rough places, for an instance, the Masonic, the Masonic Hall on Perdido and Rampart, which was a very rough section. Sometimes they played on the Globe Hall, that's in the down town section on St. Peter and St. Claude, very, very rough place.
