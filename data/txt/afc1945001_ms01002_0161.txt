MEMORANDUM

To: R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director

From: Cornelius DuBois, Executive Assistant

I think that the Board should discuss the rumor clinics
project with the facts in front of them. No one is more
horrified than I at the turn the project has taken within
the past week. I don't think it should be entirely
killed without careful consideration of the following:

1. At Harvard and at one other institution, I think it's
the University of North Carolina, rumor clinics are
already operating completely independently. These
sprang up spontaneously. The Office of Education
knows of several others which are in formative stages
and will probably go ahead on their own if there is
no central set-up.

2. If the Office of Education rumor clinics project is
to be squashed, something will also have to be done
to squash the independent projects which the Office
of Education was attempting to harness and which we
through them could control.

3. It would be disastrous in any event to have a lot of
psychologists spotted around the country doing their
own rumor analyses and discussing them publicly. The
original point of the rumor clinic project was to
provide control and prevent amateur and uninformed
public discussion of rumors. Mr. Chester Williams
broke bounds on this phase of the job, and that very
probably subjects the whole idea to scrutiny. But
let's have it carefully scrutinized before it is
killed.
