A Project For The Analysis Of Rumors
Introduction
To combat the harmful influence of rumors, it is not sufficient 
to warn a people against them. The nature of hearsay 
is such that its inspiration is not readily perceived by
private individuals; nor can rumors be effectively controlled 
by censorship. For this reason, the rumor is one
of the forms of propaganda used with greatest effect by the 
Axis. The skillful handling of rumors was most helpful to 
German in the preparation and execution of the 1940 campaign
in Western Europe, and later in the Balkans. And
there is reason to believe that Axis-inspired rumors are
already current in the United States. 
The purpose of this memorandum is to suggest means whereby:
(1) Axis methods of rumor-mongering can be critically
examined, current rumors can be identified, and 
their effect measured. 
(2) The American people can be given an opportunity to 
nullify the effect of enemy propaganda, by taking
a positive role in the identification and analysis
of rumors. 
The project here outlined envisages the cooperation of the 
Office of Education, the Office of Facts and Figures, and 
the Office of the Coordinator of Information. 

The Collection of Data
In order to establish a working basis for the analysis of 
current rumors, the first step would be to investigate
twenty-five or thirty significant rumors of the period
1939- 41, distributed among the following categories:
(1) The Mousetrap Rumor - Designed to raise unjustified
hopes, and cause a relaxation of effort. This type
of rumor was characteristic of the Sitzkrieg period
of 1930-40, and is not evident in the United States. 
A recent example is the story of Hitler's "nervous-
breakdown". The mousetrap rumor is not alone effective
directly, slowing production on and taking the edge off
