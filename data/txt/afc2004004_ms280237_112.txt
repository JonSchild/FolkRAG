6) Bown there in the dark they are lying,
They died for nine shillings a day,
They have worked out their shift and now they must lie
In the darkness until Judgement Day.

7) Now the lord Mayor of London's collecting
To hlep out our children and wives,
The owners have sent some white lilies
To pay for the poor colliers' lives.

8) Farewell all our dear wives and children,
Farewell our dear comrades as well,
Don't send your sons down the dark, dreary pit, 
They'll be doomed like the sinners in hell.

Six Jolly Miner Lads:

1) We're six jolly wee miner lads, and miner lads are we, 
We traveled Scotland, this country round and round ,
We travelled East and we travelled West, and all around the town.
For to find the treasure that lies below the ground.

2) Some hae good money and some hae nane at all, 
And them that's got money, the bottle, ale ore draw, 
They'll fill their glasses right up to the brim 
As the toast goes round and round -
Here's my hand to every wee collier lad that works below the ground.

3) I'll knit my love a cravat as doggy as can be, 
And the colours I'll put in it will fairly take his e'e, 
IF the neighbours they should go up to him and say, "Where did you get that?"
"Oh, I got it frae my doggie blog, and what do you thank of that?"

4) I'll build my love a castle, a catsle of high renown,
Neither kings nor queen, and the emperor does the same, 
Here's my heart to every wee collier lad that works below the ground.

I used to hear my father singing that down in Blantyre.
