[* (JOSEPH) *]
are a lot of people that are -- that differ over that.
BJ:    Well you know what...But you know what?   I don't see any
other way to take it but just like it says.   I believe -- I don't
believe in contradicting God's word.   'Cause I believe it's right.
He told her, and, ah, the spirit done spoke unto her and told
her she gonna be conceived with a chile.  All right.   She was
conceived with this chile.   He had told Joseph already -- Joseph
was a old -- an elder man, you know?   An' Joseph was already
es -- expauned to Mary, you know?   We call it engaged, you know,
for her husband, you see.   An' then, an' so, an' after Joseph
and Mary -- After Joseph had got Mary that, they had gone up
into their home to, you know, his wife, ah, ah, then Mary was ah,
Joseph found out Mary was, had, was pregnant.    An' then he, bein'
a, a jest man, you know, a good man, he didn't wanta publish her
out, knowin' she come outta good family, too.   He decided within
hisself that he just slip her back home, at night, ya know, early ,
you know what I mean, unknown to the peoples around.   'Cause he
didn' know nothin' about the girl.   Well, he thought she was a
real nice girl, and there she was pregnant.   See?
        An' then, that same night that he was gonna take her home,
that same -- the next day, ah, that's when the Lawd spoke to 'im
in 'is dream, to him, "Fear not.  Take Mary," you know,  "Thy
wife.   For that thing which is in, which she, which is in her,
is of the Holy Ghost."   Ya see?
       That's why I love folks to call the Holy Ghost "that thing
in that nest."   'Cause He calls Jesus a thing then.   "That --
what is in her is of the Holy Ghost," ya see?   When you call
me a thing I feel good about it.   It's a wonderful thing.
