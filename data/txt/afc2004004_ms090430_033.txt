The Agricultural Pattern

Cotton and corn are the chief agricultural crops.  In Greensboro and Union Point there are small cotton textile factories.  The 1930 Census report showed 802 people engaged in fourteen manufacturing plants in Greene County.  The size of the enterprise is suggested in the fact that the value of manufactured products was $1,938,094.  This represented, statistically at least, an average of $2,417 per worker.  During the same year, 2,588 Greene County people were engaged in agricultural pursuits, producing crops valued at $1,080,867, an average of $18 per worker.

Over half the rural white families are landless and live as renters and croppers and wage hands in competition with the Negro farmers in these same tenure classes.  Only one out of every 10 Negro farmers owns any land, and their holdings are as a rule too small for subsistence.  Of the nine-tenths who own no land, about half are croppers, owning no work animals or plows or other farm equipment; nearly a fourth are farm wage hands, and the other fourth are renters who own some work stock and farm equipment, and occupy a status between the owners and croppers.  About two-thirds of the resident whites who own land cultivate their own acreage.  The remaining white families, about one-sixth of the total, are plantation owners on whose land live most of the landless agricultural workers of both races.

The plantation system in Green County reached the zenith about 1850 and the number of large holdings remained constant for thirty years.  During this time, for fifty to seventy landlords owned 1,000 or more acres of land, in contrast with less than twenty such owners before 1825 and forty since 1900.  The break-up of the plantation in Greene County began shortly
