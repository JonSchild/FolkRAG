                Bureau of Intelligence                                     August 8, 1942

                 Region VIII, Social Security Board

SUBJECT: Cooperation with Office of War Information

The undersigned has been asked by his Regional Director to
serve during the August 3-8, 1942 period in the capacity of a
factual reporter of rumors in any way related to the war effort.
The directive was accompanied by your memorandum of instructions
providing ample guidance as to the recording of these rumors and
the forwarding of the finished report.

This reporter did not at any time during this week perform
any official travel to points of call within Region VIII, Social
Security Board.  This fact shut out any opportunity to hear
rumors, however directed, on board trains and in other scattered
places visited in the course of travel where small or large groups
of people congregate.  This particular report is, therefore,
necessarily limited to a recording of such rumors, uttered within
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, whether (a) told directly to this
reporter, (b) to a group of which he has been a part, or (c) overheard
in its telling to an outside individual or group.

Each of the four rumors, hereinafter recorded, was heard but
once.  As quoted, these set out the words actually used by the
teller so far as it has been possible to record these verbatim; at
least the heart of the rumor is conveyed by these quoted statements.
All four statements were made by adult individuals who by their
general conversation could be accurately appraised as possessing
the faculty of intelligence, except in respect to their garrulity
in giving spoken word to statements of the reported kind.  Whether
the subject of the rumor originated with the teller or was a version
of what that person had overheard, this reporter cannot state.

The recorded rumors are classified as to the manner in which
they came to the attention of this reporter, using the symbols (a), 
(b), and (c) as above defined.
