No Glamour Wanted
Pare Lorentz to Picture Real
People in Real America.

PARE LORENTZ.

HOLLYWOOD.

          Pare Lorentz, who made two popular movies without a star or a love
scene, is out to lick the boy-meets-girl idea in picture plots.
          Lorentz, who produced "The River" and "The Plow That Broke the 
Plains," has started work as master movie maker for the United States
Government.  But no glamour girls or handsome heroes need apply.
          "We may have a beautiful girl in a show sometime, but" - he pushed a 
big hand through his rumpled hair—
"she won't marry a rich young man."
    "What I want to do is photograph
America—show the people what it
really looks like.  The farms and 
factories, the hills and mountains and
streams.  Real people and real places."
    Lorentz has been harping on this 
idea for many years.  Nine years ago, as
New York's youngest movie critic, he
served notice that "'jazz heaven' is a 
good example of the kind of movies
that must struggle along without my
constructive criticism in the future."
    The young man who made movie
stars out of the Mississippi River and
a Texas "duster" has little interest in
the autograph-signing, ermine-wearing
big names of Hollywood.  He once
called Greta Garbo "homely and 
awkward," but admitted she could act. He
avoided the movies of Clara Bow, the
"It" girl.
    "Hollywood is finding out that stars
are the bunk," he declared.  "You've
got to have a good story, fine 
photography and intelligent direction to 
make a picture.  The best actor in
the world can't make a good picture
without them.  Movies are made by
cutting and direction, and the actor
isn't important at all."
    Lorentz depends on the adventure of 
trying out new ideas in movie-making
to lure topnotch workmen in his film
projects.
    But ever since the little office was 
opened this summer on top a local
bank building, movie-struck girls and
square-jawed youths have been 
knocking at the door.  Old-time Hollywood
cameramen and writers, too, have 
applied for jobs.  One little blond asked
for the job of script girl.
    "I'm not even sure what a script girl
would do," Lorentz remarked.
    In his new job with the President's
National Emergency Council, Lorentz
hopes to assist in co-ordinating the
sprawling movie efforts of the 
Government, now scatters in dozens of 
bureaus.  The Government has been
putting out movies since the Civil
Service Commission tried "Advance by
Merit" in 1912.
    Lorentz says he doesn't know what a 
documentary film is; the nearest he
ever came to a definition was: "A
factual film which is dramatic."
    Lorentz has two duties in the new 
set-up:
    1. To produce more pictures like 
"The Plow" and "The River" for 
general distribution.  It is rumored his
next one may relate the story of 
technological unemployment.
    2. To advise Government 
departments on their educational films.  He
hopes the Government may 
experiment with cartoon characteristics to 
teach such lessons as traffic safety and
with humorous charts and maps.
    He finds it "a terribly exciting job."
    "I'm getting along on four hours 
sleep," the 32-year-old producer 
continued.  "This is a crazy business at
best.  I don't know anybody in the
movie business who hasn't got stomach
trouble.  I don't know why I dot into
it. But it's fun."
    Lorentz tried to sell Hollywood on
his picture-making idea before he
talked to Rexford Tugwell and 
Secretary Wallace about it.  Hollywood
turned him down then—and he 
turned Hollywood down later.  Friends
declare one studio offered him $170,000
a year after "The Plow" and "The
River" appeared.
    Lorentz (his first name is 
pronounced "Pear") commutes between

Washington and New York, where he
lives with his wife (the former Sally
Bates of the Broadway stage) and
family—"a boy, a girl and a dog."
"My idea of the proper way to enjoy
the movies," he wrote once, "is 
incorporated in college movie houses.
You can hiss the villain, jeer the hero,
go to sleep, put your feet in the aisle
and have a hell of a good time."
