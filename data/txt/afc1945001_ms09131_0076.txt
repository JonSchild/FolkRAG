Hitler went to heaven and got a 40 mph. cloud
from St. Peter. He rode around on that
for a while until he saw a cloud with Mussolini
on it going 45 mph. He took his cloud
back to St. Peter and demanded a 50 mph
cloud. So he got it. And he rode around
on this cloud for awhile until he saw
Hirohito go by on a 55 mph cloud. He
took his cloud back to St. Peter and
demanded a 60 mph cloud, got that,
and rode around for awhile longer, until
he saw Roosevelt go by on a 65 mph
cloud. Again he took his cloud back
and gruffly demanded and got a 70 mph
cloud. He rode along on this for awhile,
until a cloud whizzed by him
doing 80. He went back to St. P. and
demanded an 85 mph cloud. But this time
St. Peter said, "Sorry old boy but
I can't do it - that cloud belonged to
J. C., the Boss's son."
