Durham Gaol.
An you'll all have heard of Durham Gale
It would you much surprise
To see the prisoners in the yard
When on their exercise
This yard is built all round with walls
So noble + so strong.
Whoever goes there they'll have to stay
Their time be short or long.
-
For there's no luck in Durham gale
There's no luck at all
What is rye bread + skilly for 
But just to make you small.

For half an hour you'll walk about
From half past nine till ten
You're not allowed to talk or shout
nor wink at other men.
For there's officers to stand + watch
In that they take a pride
For if you talk they'll seize your nose
and pull you right inside.
