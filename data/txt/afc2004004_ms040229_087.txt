Thou girl may the sun be against thee
Thou hast taken my [?] canst
                   from my pillow
Stone in shoe by thy bed for thee
[?] in tooth be thy sleep for thee
[P??????] in eye be thy life for thee
[?][?]little slumberer be seen on thy pillow
My [?]be seen upon thy shoulder
                [image]
This is no secondhand cloth
And it is not by [?]
And it is not property of [cle?ric]
"       "  "  "       "  of priest
But thine own property 
O son of my body
By moon & by sun
In the presence of God
And keep thou it!
Mayest thou enjoy it
    "          "     wear it
     "         "      finish it
Until thou find it in shreds, in
strips, in rags in tatters
