1)  The king sits in Dunfermline town
Drinking at the wine.
And he has called for the best skipper
In Fife and all the land.

2)  Then out it spake an old carle
Stood by the king's ain knee.
Says, "Patrick Spens is the best sailor
That ever sailed the sea."

3)  The king has screvit a long letter
And signed it wi's ain hand.
And sent it tae young Patrick Spens
Was walking on Leith sands.

4)  "Tae Norrowa, tae Norrowa,
Tae Norrowa ower the faem,
The king's daughter o' Norrowa
Tis ye maun bring her hame."

5)  When first he lookit this letter upon
A muckle laugh gaed he,
But ere he'd done the reading o't,
The tear blinded his e'e.

6)  They hadna been in Norrowa
A week but barely three
When all the lords o' Norrowa
Did up and spake so free.

7)  These outlands Scots waste our king's gold,
And swallow our Queen's fee.
Weary fall the tongue that spake
Sich a muckle lee.

8)  "How can this be?" cried Patrick Spens,
"I pray ye tell tae me.
The bows of my ship are wrought wi' gold
And I've twelve kists of white money.

9)  Take tent, take tent my guidmen all,
And mind ye be weel forn,
For come it wind or come it hail,
Our guid ship sails the morn.

10)  Then oot it spake the weatherman,
"I fear we'll all be drowned.
For I saw the new moon late yestreen, wi' the auld moon in her arms."
