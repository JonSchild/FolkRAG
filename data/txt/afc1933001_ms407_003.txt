Spiritual

Lord, what a mornin' when the stars
begin to fall,
Hell is uncapped an' burnin',
 de dry bones come a-Creepin'
De dragon shall be loosened, shout, 
shout Satans about.

You may bury me in the East, you
may bury me in the West,
But I'll hear de trumpet sound
in dat mornin'
---------"------------
Oh, He call you by de lightnin', He call
you by de thunder
He call you by de middle night cry
Oh come home, come home, my Father's children
An' He aint got wrong yit.

When I was lost in de wilderness, King James hand me 
a candle down
