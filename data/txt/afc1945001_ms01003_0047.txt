Mr. DuBois

MEMORANDUM                    April 18, 1942

To:  R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director
From:  Eugene Katz, Social Service Division  EK

Subject:  Attached communication re. receipt and possessing of
rumor information

At a Rumor discussion last week, in which Messrs. 
Du Bois, Stanton, Franzen and Cottrell participated, it was
agreed that the following procedure be adopted as soon as possible to report rumors from the field with the limited means at our command:-

(1) Discuss the rumor problem in person, with 8 or
10 nearby members of our Editorial Correspondence
Panel to work out from these conversations a plan
for Editorial Correspondence reports on local
rumors

(2) As soon as these conversations have taken place and 
a tenable procedure refined from them, the rumor
problem is to be broached to other Correspondence 
Panelees who will submit weekly (?) reports on
those topics most spoken of by word of mouth but
unreported in regular information channels.

It was agreed by Neil Du Bois and myself, and confirmed
by Drs. Stanton, Cotrell and Fanzen, that we did not wish to use isolated college faculties or clinics nor, for the time being, 
field representative of other Government agencies.

To sum up, we are not now equipped to handle the Social
Security Board experiment suggested in the attached memorandum 
and, therefore, are enclosing for your signature, if you approve, 
a note to Mr. Huse explaining the situation.
