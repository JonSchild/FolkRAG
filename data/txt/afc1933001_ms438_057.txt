Alabama Bound

Lead Belly learned this song on a "cotton pick" near Dallas in 1912. It
was "ringin'", that is, very popular, then, says Lead Belly.

I'm Alabama bound,
I'm Alabama bound,
Ef I don't sink or turn around,
I'm Alabama bound,

On de road agin,
On de road agin,
Ef I don't be lucky, boys, an' win,
On de road agin,

Doncha want to go?
Doncha want to go?
An' see de great big Gulf
Of Mexico?

I seed you comin',
Ap' on in yo' han',
I heered you cryin', "Have mercy, Lawd, gov'ner,
On my man."

Oh, de preacher preached,
Oh, de preacher preached,
Great Godamighty, babe,
An' de teacher teached.

Oh, de preacher preached,
Sisters turned around,
An' de deacons in de amen corner, shoutin', sweet gal,
"I'm Alabama bound."

Lawdy, some folks say,
Lawdy, some folks say,
Lawd, de preacher's gone an' lef' his wife
An' he's gone to stay.

Gonna buy me a pistol,
Forty-four rounds,
Gonna find my gal in Alabama,
Gonna shoot her down.
