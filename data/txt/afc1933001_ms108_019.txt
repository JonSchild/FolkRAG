in Paris more cheaply than
we could in New York
and at a very nice
hotel - and clean in spite

Here we stay in a
small hotel on a cliff facing the sun

Monte Carlo. Miss Terrill and
I were there yesterday in the big

me. She stayed by me at the

The two girls have
caught beaus and have gone
in to a movie tonight at
Nice. They have [?] two

long be popular. 2 Madeleine
Place c/o Thos Cook & Sons Paris, will
likely be our permanent address.

Love to Pat and Susan.
Your Father,
John A. Lomax
