Dear MrH. Spivacke,
Chief, Division of Music.
Library of Congress,
Washington.
Dear Mr. Spivacke,
I now forward the remainder of my collection of folk songs viz:- Nos 101
to 246. These with two previous parcels complete the series. The break in numbers
from 247 to 463 represents an interval during which I was not contributing folk
songs to the paper that published them. These in the interlude were not true folk
songs.
These songs were printed in the ordinary way and without special type and that
by the way was a pioneer move in popular music printing. The width of the news
column prevented proper space being given to the music and in any use of the songs
a musician would need to round off the short end bars and otherwise titivate the
script. The melodies are there, however, true to tradition.
I presume you will preserve the songs in strong volumes accessible to the
reader and not merely have them in loose form, seeing they are so flimsy.
In any correspondence, it will be sufficient to refer to the number of the
song.
I shall thank you for early draft for 20 dollars as arranged to cover typing.
Yours sincerely
Sam Henry
