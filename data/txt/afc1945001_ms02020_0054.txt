Mr. John B. Kaiser, Librarian,
Oakland Public Library,
Main Library Office,
632 14th Street ,
Oakland, California

Dear Mr. Kaiser:

            People at Allendale seem to be regarding the
refrain from talking campaign, and have repeated
nothing which we feel would be classed as a real
rumor, during the period of August 10 - 15. We
have not heard anything of the sort on street cars,
buses or on the street.
            The following remarks, probably read in the
newspapers or heard over the radio, were made in 
the presence of one of the staff or myself:
            "All married men 'are going to be called in       [*1*]
the draft by November."
            "Married men between the ages of 20 and 45,
and all single men between those ages, will be            [*1*]
drafted soon. I know a cleaner with three children
who was told he would have to get into an essential
industry."
            "It is almost impossible to find a place to
live under $40. My neighbor has been looking for
such a place for two months."                                 [*-3*]
            In regard to the Solomon Islands action,
when newspapers and radio announced that defensive
action always meant heavy losses, the reaction has
been:
            "They are getting us ready for some bad news".

                                                    Respectfully submitted,

                                                                LaVon Schreiber
