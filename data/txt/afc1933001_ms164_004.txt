Dear Lee:

I certainly thank you for the interesting ballad you
sent and it will go into the special starred collection in the
Library. Maybe we can record the tune someday when I'm in
New York. If you have any more like this, please send them
along. Your copy is herewith returned. I'll speak about the
other matter when I see you.

With kindest regards,

Alan Lomax
