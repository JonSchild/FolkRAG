Dear Professor Lomax:

I was certainly glad to hear from you again
and the only reason I haven't written you is that I have
been jumping all over the country for at least a year.
I took my mother on a twelve thousand mile automobile
trip through the South las fall but just never could 
seem to get through Dallas, although I thought of you
often.  As you know, all of my mother's family live around
Houston and it seemed we just had to go through there each
time.

My mother's address is the same as mine.  We live 
at 1623 N. Vista Street in Hollywood, phone Hollywood 7408
(an unlisted number).  However, I always maintain the
above post office box, have for 25 years, and any letter
ever addressed there should, in the course of time, reach
me, regardless of where I am bouncing.

I spent a month in Washington about $1500.00
of my money in endeavoring to convince the Surgeon General
that a blood pressure of 145 is not high blood pressure. 
This was the pressure during an examination for return 
to the Army, and since then my my pressure has been low as
128.  I have a somewhat volatile disposition, as you know,
and most anything, excitement of examination, or even
laughter, could make it kick up ten points.

I got Senator Connally to help me and a lot of my 
old friends in the army, but I got exactly nowhere.

As you know, I have been an officer of infantry,
cavalry and artillery, leaving the army as a captain of
field artillery, and spent two years as executive officer
of a staff branch in Washington.

I came back out here, intending to stay until fall
when I hope the army will be more liberal in its physical
requirements and to take a lot of physical exercise for 
the purpose of stabilizing my blood pressure at a low level.
My own doctor , of 25 years' standing, and who is really my
doctor only because he is an old business friend and takes
care of my mother's health now, assures me that I do not 
have arterial hypertension and that there is nothing in
God's world the matter with me.

Apparently, the army doctors are either hood-winked
or expert people to take something to reduce blood-pressure.
In the examination, if your blood pressure is a certain
level, they have you come, back for three day's readings.
