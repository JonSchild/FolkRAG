The history of Francisco Ulivir

The bloody bandit -
I want to sing you a horrible thing
of a fool husband & his wife
I want to let everybody know
what the br Ulivir had done -
There have always been bandits
But none so degenerate as this one

He came to a little vil an o mt
Calerd -Cartel di Udicar
There he comit his murdr
So gret that all the papers talked
of it
And they'll speak of it fer another 100 yrs

In this town a little [twunette?]
Poor, honest, educated, but [suicu?]
He was married & had 4 children
their [?olvo] home
And he supported them, truly
with many sacrifices
He had 3 small ones & a baby of 9 months.
