e.   Speaking staff. Speakers appearing before all manner of organizations, 
discussing current rumors and illustrating the dangers
of rumors are a valuable asset to any anti-rumor campaign.

f.   Morale Wardens. These are people within the community whose prime 
duty is to report all rumors. They constitute a listening network 
which is invaluable and also serve as a public opinion panel.

g.   Feature Stories. This type of publicity is illustrated by the 
article appearing in the Reader's Digest of September 1942 entitled 
Boston Makes War on Rumor. Other articles and stories 
could well take up the subject of wartime rumor. the relation 
of rumor to propaganda, etc.

h.   Films. Although the cinema is a very effective method of bringing 
the subject to the public, to date it has been put to very little 
use. Mr. Blabbermouth, however, is a notable example of an excellent 
film dealing with his subject.

VI.   Points of attack on rumor:

A publicity campaign attacking rumor may pursue the following lines:.

1.   Rumor is untrustworthy, almost always false. No sensible person 
relies on it.

2.   Rumor is often an instrument of enemy propaganda.
to spread them.

3. Rumors are destructive of morale: it is unpatriotic and shameful
to spread them.

4.   The person who spreads rumors is a foolish, malicious, or dangerous 
person.

5.   Rumor mongering is a form of scapegoating, blaming the innocent for 
one's own troubles.
