That there are plans for a huge armament depot at the California-
Oregon b[i]order.  Source is probably California labor unions. 
"Navy and Army construction divisions are all talking about 
it in San Francisco, Sacramento, and Los Angeles."  It is said 
to be scheduled for very early construction.  The rumor was 
probably a result of the fact that some of the unions were 
told about the doubling of size of the Hawthorne, Nevada 
Naval Ammunition Depot.
