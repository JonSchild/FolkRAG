A War Episode

Week before last I read in
the newspaper about an American
soldier whose ship had be sunk.
He was thrown overboard but
finally found a raft to which
he clung in shark infested
waters. He came close to an
Island in the Pacific where he was
seen by some friendly natives.
They took him to their village
where he rested and was fed and
clothed. The next day was Sunday.
A priest of the village, and
American came and told the
soldier to sit on a porch where
the natives could see him.
He did as directed and soon
natives appeared wearing the
mans clothes. They gathered
in a group around him and
stared at him. Finally a rescue
ship came and took him back
to civilization.
