MEMORANDUM
TO THE                                                      FROM THE
LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS
REFERRING TO
Dr. Spivacke,
I should like to suggest a project to you which I believe 
will be of interest and value to the Archive of American Folk
Song in the Library of Congress. This project is one that I 
have thought over at considerable length and that I hold personally
very dear.
It is impor[tor?]tant to the [completely]  adequate performance of my duties
as assistant in the Archive of Folk Song that I have [considerably] more systematic
academic training in anthropology and in the anthropological approach 
to primitive and folk music, [than I have so far had.] To this end I should like 
to spend the spring studying anthropology and musicology at New York University
and Columbia University in New York City. At the same time I look forward to
continuing my work for the Library on a part time arrangement, recording the
great store of folk music of New York City and investigating the extent of American
folk song items already recorded by commercial concerns.
The courses [I am] I plan to take are the following:
In New York University,
  Primitive and Oriental Music, Dr. Curt Sachs.
In Columbia University,
  Folk Music, Dr. George Herzog
Problems and Methods in Field Work in Ethnology, Dr. Bunzel
Psychology and Ethnology, Dr. Klineberg
This program might,of course, be changed somewhat when I [come to know] should come
to know the individual professors [some] more intimately, but the intent of the
year's work would remain the same. I might add that I plan to [take] study
music with private instructors.
The expenses connected with this [half] semester of academic work will
be:
Registration and tuition.................             $250.00
Living expenses...............................            $600.00
                                                   Total............$850.00
I would expect to add to the Archive in this period at least two hundred
records important in the study of American folk-music, and at the same time to
acquire training which would make my future work for the Archive [many times] more
valuable.
