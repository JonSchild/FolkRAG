1. In a near by vicinity there lived a little
boy with his grandparents. One day he went
to visit some of his playmates while playing he
saw a man who resembled Hilter to him from
the pictures he had seen of him. He ran home
very fast and asked his mother for a gun. She asked 
what did he want He replied Mama I saw Hitler
& I want to be the first one to shoot at Him."

2. Many people are asking why aren't there
more happiness instead of sadness. No one 
smiles any more now. An old man answered
one young lad and said "Son, there'll be no more
smiles or happiness until we attend Hitler
furnel."
