August 7, 1942
During a visit to Abbeville, South Carolina on July 27
I heard several people say that it was reported that enemy
submarines had been receiving oil and supplies at or near
Brookgreen Gardens, between Myrtle Beach and Pawley's Island, 
on the coast of South Carolina, and that the caretaker of
Brookgreen Gardens had been arrested by the FBI for giving 
aid to enemy submarines. [*33*]
