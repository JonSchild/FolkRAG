of interest about yourself.
Mrs. Munro (husband is Alfred G. 
Munro, Boston-N.E. Mgr.  J. Shubert
Theaters) - was looking over the big 
book last night, and was quite 
thrilled over "John Henry."  She is 
an actress and lecturer - had never seen 
your book.  I'm glad we own it.
Perhaps you will have lunch with 
my husband and me.  He is head of the 
Economics Dept. at Clark University - once 
lectured for a summer at U. of Texas, Austin.
Isn't it a lovely place?  We saw it 
last Summer
Cordially ours
