Reel #5, Song 6
[*35*]

SANDY REE  (SANGAREE)

There is a special dance for this song, almost like "Aunt Dinah."
It is a couple dance.  On reel dated October 12, 1961, Bessie
Jones talks about "Sangaree," but her back-home version is "Sandy Ree."
She also sings the song on another reel.

REFRAIN:
Mama got to shovel,
Sandy Ree
Papa got to hoe, (REFRAIN)
If that ain't fun, (REFRAIN)
I don't know, (REFRAIN)  (4)

CHORUS:
Oh babe, (REFRAIN) (4)

If I live, (REFRAIN)
And don't get killed, (REFRAIN)
Gonna make my home, (REFRAIN)
In Jacksonville, (REFRAIN)    (CHORUS)

Chicken in the backyard, (REFRAIN)
Scratchin' up peas, (REFRAIN)
Dog on the back porch, (REFRAIN)
Scratchin' off fleas, (REFRAIN)    (CHORUS)
