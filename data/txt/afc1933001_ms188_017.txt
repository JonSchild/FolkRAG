Dear Mr. Lomax 
I am sending to you herewith a 
summary of my education and work 
as a research man in negro music 
and folk-lore. 
I am exceedingly busy at this time 
which has caused me to be later than
was indicated on the telegram.
Please inform me, as soon as possible, 
about the terms and conditions in regard 
to the project. 
Your suggestions about areas was very 
carefully noted. I am acquainted with all 
of them  I should, in the event of appointment, 
prefer to work "at large"- this literally.  I 
would work up some festivals -folk Choirs, 
etc.. 
Sincerely,
W. L. James
