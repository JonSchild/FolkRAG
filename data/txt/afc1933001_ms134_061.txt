June 28, 1938.
Mr. Melvin C. Oathout,
208 Beech Street,
Fulton, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Oathout:
The recording you have heard of consists at the present
time of a set of fifty records made by Jelly Roll
Morton--the folk songs and blues he knows, the
old jazz and ragtime styles that he remembers, his own
compositions along with discussion and explanation of
all this. We hope to add extensively to this material
in the future as we encounter other distinguished hot 
jazz musicians.
The function of the Archive at present, however, is to
collect and organize recorded material pertinent to the
field of American folk-song and I don't know whether an
extensive bibliography on jazz, which of course would
have to be expanded as time went on, would fit into our
program.
The Division of Music, on the other hand, of which Dr.
Spivacke is chief, already has a considerable bibliography
of jazz music and would be, I am told, very decidedly
interested in your work; and at the very least
would like to use your bibliography as a supplementary
check list of materials on jazz, I shall, therefore,
turn your letter over to Dr. Spivacke and you will hear
from him shortly.
Of course, I am personally, if not officially, very
much interested in your work and shall give your material
my personal attention when and if it comes to
the Music Division. I have, besides, a question I
should like to ask you on behalf of the Archive. Do
you have in your bibliography references, besides
those which recently appeared in "Down Beat" on Jelly
Roll Morton? What is your own opinion about him as a
figure in the history and development of hot music? I
should greatly appreciate whatever answers you can give 
to these questions. Thanking you for your generous proposal
and your kind letter, I am,
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
