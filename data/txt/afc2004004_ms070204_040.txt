So I buckled up my brogs, shook
hands with my spade
And out of old Ireland lilse
a dashing yg blade

The first man I met, he
asked me to 'list',
Says I by my paddy, give
me hold of yr fist
I'll give you five guineas &
I won't give any more
Go to headqtrs & u cn gt
a 1/2 a [?] one
I went to hdqtrs & the 1st thing he
give me
Was an old long coat & two
straps of leather for to buckle
round my
throat
I buckled round my " [throat] &
I went to the
fair
