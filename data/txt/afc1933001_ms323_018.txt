HERE AND
THERE
IN
MEXICO

The delightful town of Dolores Hidalgo, birthplace
of Mexican Independence, is full of many
beautiful reminders of Spanish Colonial days.
Note the flagstone floor and sidewalk as well
as the neatly laid cobblestone street paving, so
typical of these gracious old towns.  The stone
carving around the windows of the house across
the street is characteristic of the fine work
wrought by Indian stonemasons of Colonial
times.

A corner of a typical Mexican country market,
where the Indians from the surrounding region
come once each week to sell the wares they
have patiently made by hand.  Although the
baskets shown here are of simple design, basketry
in some parts of Mexico assumes an
equal status among the finest of the popular
arts.  Gourds, called gaujes, answer many
practical needs; they are cut into a variety of
shapes, and in some districts, notably Michoac√°n,
they are handsomely lacquered with intricate
designs.

The typical Mexican kitchen - especially the
type seen throughout the State of Puebla, such
as is illustrated here - is a study of picturesqueness.
All the pottery seen in the kitchen is
handmade, and is typical of the types commonly
used everywhere in Mexico.  The decorative
handmade glazed tile which adds such a colorful
note is a specialty of the State of Puebla.
Note the charcoal stove in the background.  To
the left of the stove, below the window, is the
stone metate, which is universally used in Mexican
kitchens for grinding corn, chili and other
foods.
