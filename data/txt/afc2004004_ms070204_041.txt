In Metz a dance - beefy girls
and redfaced boys and the
worst jazz I ever heard --
unbelieveable -- Rogers City
the next morning, empty, gray
and [out] on the edge a 
big calcite plant standing on 
the edge of Lake Michigan
like a big daddy long
legs --
Posen: Rev. Czyper, stern,
clean cut, owning [we] all the
Poles, cold and empty like
a drum [t ta] that beats itself
