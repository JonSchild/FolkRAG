the chicken is rubbed down the front
& then back to head - down back
down left side, down right side
around neck - around over head.

Erz appears (the same woman as Ogoun) staggering
weakly at first. & cooing or whinging
very soft & feminine - she puts her 
hands on her hips and looks over
shoulder disdainfully like Mae West - 
[ * She fans herself with stiff hands fluttering about her breast bones looking around like an imperious *]
she is fanned - washes her hands
& face with lotion - rubs her
hands, with powder - looking round
obviously rolling her eyes - everyone 
fans her - a chair is brought
& a white embroidered cushion - she
rubs the face & heads of all the
men with lotion - [?] and asks
madam E. how she likes it
later however conciliating her by
washing  E.'s face - she shakes
hands with the women with
her little finger - her attention
is very bawdily for the men -
