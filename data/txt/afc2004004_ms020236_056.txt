An' then say I did it.   Well, I did help do it, an' they say I
was a cunjur, ha, ha!   An' that's why they didn't know 'bout
my business.    I was this an' I was the other, see?   But that wa'n'
why; it wa'n' that.   I don't know what Dr. Bell all did for her.
All I know, he stayed there.  But I [kn went] was goin' to the woods to get trumpet roots
an' things I know that was good for swellin', but that was no
use in a rare case, ya see.   Dr. Bell come there an' he really
worked on her, ya see?   An' he stayed there almos' a week.

               But anyway, that was funny.   So this night that we was
sittin' around there, talkin', I an' Miss Alice, a colored man
came [to] in the house.  An' he was one of the wood men that haul --
snake logs in the woods -- he walked in there.   We all called him
Shelby.   He come in there an' he said, "It's a man outside want to
speak to you."   I said, "Who is it?"   He said, "Just a man."
I said, "Who is it?"  He says, "Oh. . ."  An' he say, "Jus' a man."
An' I looked at Miss Alice, I say, "[Miss Alice,] Mus' I go see
who it is?"   She say, "I don' know."   She asked him, "Who is it?"
He say, "Jus a man.   You know I ain' got no police out there."
Say, "Jus' a man."   An' so, I got my [purse, I] pistol; I gotta --
had a lil' ol' gun.   'Cause Cecil got me one.   I got my pistol
an' I walk on out the do'.   An' I walked to the corner of the
chimney at the end of the house, I walked there an' this man
was standin' there.   He had on an army suit, whole army suit, you
know.   The whole thing, with the coat -- the big coat -- an'
the cap.   See, it was rainin' and kinda cool.   An' I didn' see
nothin' but the middle of his face, jus' in there between, an'
he looked right at me an' laughed.   An' he spoke to me, very
nicely.  An' I looked up in his face.   That's Joe Dean!   Whay!
Landamercy!   I don't believe I could pull the trigger!   I didn't
let him know I was scared.   An' I spoke to him, an' so.   He said
did -- He asked for everybody [one], did every one. . ."Dis one tell you what
I told 'em; [did] dis one tell ya?"  I said, "Yeah, they tol' me."
An' so different ones tell me, [an] so. . .an, um. . .an' so he asked
me why I didn't go. . .I said, "I wouldn't go to your house."  I 
Jus' tol' him straight; tol' him just like I'm tellin' you, tol'
'im, "I wouldn't go to your house."   He say, "Why?"  I said,
