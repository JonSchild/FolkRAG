Dear Mr. Lomax:

   I am sending by separate mail a copy of
the thesis that you requested to see.  This
thesis, I think, with some relatively minor
revisions, would be well worth publishing, and
I have been trying to find some way to subsidize
its publication.  Various Czech organizations in
Texas have offered to help finance the printing.
I am wondering whether, if you should like it as
well as I do, there is any way it could be brought
out as a public document.

   With the Czechoslovakian government in exile,
the national university closed, and the scholars
in concentration camps, the Czech people think
of Texas as the chief repository of their folk
culture.  I believe, therefore, that the publication
of this thesis might prove an investment in
good will.

Sincerely yours,
[*Mody C. Boatright*]
