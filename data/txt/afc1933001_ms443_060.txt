Sometimes I lives in town,
Sometimes I have a great notion,
Jumpin' into de river an' drown.

had  stole her 'way from home  an' she looked at him when he
he come in one night --- she sit down an '/she wanted to talk to him 

You caused me to weep an' you caused me to moan, 
You caused me to leave my home, 
Last word I heerd her say, 
'I  want you to sing this song.

Gwine   take me  a stroll up town-
