Dear Mr. Lomax

I listen every morning to 
the "School of the Air" programs, and last
Tuesday I so enjoyed your broadcast of
songs. "Tom PIerce's Gray Mare" appealed
to me. Enclosed cards I bought in
England at that very place, about ten
years ago, for a souvenir. When I heard
the song. I decided to send them to 
you. They might amuse some one.

I have kept them all these years and
now I am over 80 years old, and you
may have them. I look forward to
each Tuesday morning with great
pleasure. Success to your program
Sincerely
(Miss) A.C. Andrews.
