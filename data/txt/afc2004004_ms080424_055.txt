Tape:  Roll 51, Stan and Ray Hicks    4
Ray:  They had that with 'em.
Stan:  They had it in jugs.  And a corncob stopper in it.  And they're
serenatin' one (unint.) & I didn't know much about what was comin'
off, didn't know too much about it, and I saw 'em a goin' to this
jug.  You know, they'd go to it and pull the stopper out, and
doin' somethin'. . .and they had it in the fire (unint.). . . you know,
over by the fireplace.  So I got me a chair -- I wasn't big enough
to reach it -- so I got a chair, and I got up there, and they got
this jug, pretty big jug, 'bout like that.  And I (unintelligible)
. . . . .and it's moonshine!  And I got too much, and my lights went
out.  Mother thought it was poison or something, father, . . . .
Mother said "Robert, Robert, Stanley's gonna die!  He's poisoned
himself!"  He said " I guess the little devils been in the moonshine!"
(laughter)
AL:  Listen now, it was hard times around here, gettin' some lovin'
from a girl, wasn't it?
Ray:  Yessir, it was hard to get lovin' from a girl.  The parents,
they hit 'em down there and made you suffer.  You had to really
watch, in with one(?) if you got a piece of anything with a girl.
They watched at you.  And then if it was one, like maybe, got out
and had broke one youngun or had got started or somethin' a raisin'
it. . .They would get a man to go in there, and she would be lonesome,
and he would intercourse with her and then he'd take off.  And so
he would go again, and she told him "Now I'm gonna hold you this
time, you've been just leavin' off, to stay with and talk awhile."
And she made him talk awhile before they had the intercourse, this
one did, she lived right over across the mountain here.
AL:  And what happened when he told his friend about it?
