c/o The American Legation, 
Cairo, Egypt, 
March 29, 1942.

Dear Mr. John and Miss Terrill:

This is to tell you
goodbye for some time--I8m leaving in the morning for
Egypt and India for the Newspaper PM and the Chicago Sun.
This is what I8m trained for and I think I can do more good
this way than in any other--I think the duty of a newspaperman
with our troops is to write about them in such a way that
the people at home can feel that they are with them.

Thank you so much for the Christmas card, for
the simple and interesting and real greeting. I very much
liked Our Singing Country, and I ll be waiting anxiously
to read The Ballad Hunter s hunt, especially about us
and the chaingang. Nobody in our time has done more than
you all have done. I have a book coming out in the summer.

My love to you both and to Alan.

As over,
Ben [SIGNATURE]
