are confused about the rubber situation.

Here in Indianapolis resides Col. A.A.W. Grist, world
traveler and former political associate of Bonar Law and Lloyd
George.  Last night, at Col. Grist's invitation, the News
Bureau representative of OWI and myself visited Col. Grist at
his apartment.

He is representing the British Propaganda Ministry
in this area.  He has a weekly radio program and writes many
letters to editors citing British side of the conflict.
Col. Grist would like to arrange a program in cooperation
with OWI whereby we would take up the rumors we hear each week
and he would refute them.

Col. Grist lives in a luxurious apartment, with servants,
and apparently has unlimited resources.  He is a highly
intelligent, aggressive man of about 60.
