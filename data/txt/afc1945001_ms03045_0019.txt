OHIO REPORT

CLEVELAND
"We can't win this war until Government
officials and Congress quit
playing politics -- by waiting for
public opinion to be generated before
action can be taken. The war
can be lost before the November
election, and with the politicians
who are controlling actions
of the Government, nothing can be
done that might jeopardize the
status quo of Congressmen and Senators
that are up for re-election."
From a general manager of a war
plant.
"Black markets are numerous in the
tire industry, and anyone knowing
the right people can get new
tires for double the original
cost." -- From the same general
manager.
