Vera Hall, reel 8, page 6...
A; When you saw her get happy, well, you got happy yourself...
V: I sho did. I was so happy, because she had been goin
there every year, just moanin, and I don't keer how I talked
to her and told her bout how I got my religion, she seemed to
be just so hard to believe. She was just sittin up on the bench,
just sittin up there. Every year they have revival, there sit
her, just sittin up there. I just give her up. [I] She was
younger than I was-- "You that hard to believe in the Lord and
believe him a savior, you just don't want no religion, you
just don't want to live for him. She say, "Yes I do, but I just
don't want to got to have, just got to see sumpin." So I
say, "Okay, pray on." So I'd given her up, but I know she kep
goin to church, kep goin to revival. So when I heard her, I
thought it was her voice and when I got to the door, it was her.
[and they] They had her comin out of the church and she was just
fallin from side to side and hollin "Thank God, thank God!" and
Lord have mercy! I just don't know what come of myself for a
while. Um-um! I was so happy.
A: You just went clear out of yourself for awhile.
V: I sho did. Just went somewhere. When I knowed anything, they
had us all (GIGGLE) way down the road... I never did get in church
I never did get further than the do. Um I sho was glad that girl
got religion, that 's the truth, was just too gladx to get her
offa that mourner's bench. (Chuckle). So I don't have none of
my people a mourner, sinner. All of my people blong to church.
E: She was very sincere, wasn't she? She waited till she got it
didn't she?
