AL: She'd whup it hard?

WB:She'd whup it hard and she'd say, "Y'all go to work!" Yall ain't dd'nt it."

Then she'd set up and she'd laugh, "Haw, haw, haw!" Then she'd sing a song,
you know, about sister Katie:

You gotta go, sister Katie
I gotta go, sister Katie
I gotta go
Brother's done gone

And less I forget, "Haw, Haw, Haw! Y'all better go to work. Y'all ain't
working yet." And she'd go up there and she'd get that cotton and she'd....

AL: Can I have a little more of that "Sister Katie?"

WB:Yeah. She'd grab it and she'd go over to Big Nick and she'd look.

"C'mon there children?
Sister Katie, we gotta go
Sister Katie, we gotta go
Sister done done gone
We gotta go
We gotta go
We gotta go
Katie -
We gotta go
Don't catch you with Katie
Cause we gotta go
Katie. Katie. Katie.
We gotta go.
Don[n]'t gotta go
We already gone.
Katie gone..."
And she stopped it and started laughing, "Haw, Haw, Haw!"

And she'd up our hand again. "Y'all doin pretty good, but you better go
to work. Go to work."

And at night she'd come in. She'd be sitting out there. She was crazy
about me. "Come here, Son." I'd go over to where she was. She'd say,
"Yuo know what that sounds like?" I'd say, "What, grandm?" She'd
say, "Sounds like I could hear the gun bull shootin now.'
