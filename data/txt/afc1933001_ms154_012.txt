Dear Miss Newton:

I am sorry to be so slow in replying to
your letter of February 7 but we have been inquiring here
as to how Mr. Lomax felt about the proposal.  I think
Mr. Alan Lomax would be glad to take part and would consider
a fee of seventy-five or one hundred dollars as satis-
factory.  I think the whole idea, as you put it forward,
is excellent.

Faithfully yours,
The Librarian of Congress
