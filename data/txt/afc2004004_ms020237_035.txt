     So he did.  Said, "Thank you.  I sure thank you.  I didn't know how in the worl'
I was gonna feed my cow."  He couldn't understand it.
     He said, "Well!  One fool, sure 'nough."  An' he went on.
He figured he never would find another'n like that.  So he got,
rode there further, an' he seed, seed a woman.  An' she was --
had a wheelbarra, you know?  An' she run, ah, out the door; she
run back in the house; she run out the door; she run back in
the house.
     He didn' know what in the world the matter wit' the lady.
Just stood an' looked.  She had a wheelbarra, wasn' puttin'
nothin' on it.  Wasn' puttin' nothin' in the wheelbarra, so
jus', jus' run out there an', an' stan' a lil' while an' phoo!
right back in the house.  He didn', he didn' know what in the 
world was happenin' there.  So he, ah, he 'cided he would go an
ast 'er.  he ast her, he said, "Lady," ah, he said, "What's the
trouble? What's the matter?"
     She said, "Mister," she said, said, "I'm goin' a have company
tomorra.  It's sumpin' I never jus' do, people comin' to see me."
Said, "An' I scrub my house all over."  She said, "An' I'm  tryin'
to git the sunshine to come in there wit' me so I can dry it."
See, she'd git out there an' the shine in that wheelbarra an' she'd
run back there an' git in the shade.  Time she git there, cain't
get a l --, cain't get none in there!  Ha, ha!  Everytime she'd git. . .
TL:  What the heck?
BJ:  She was tryin' to git the sunshine an' she, see, the
sun would shine in the wheelbarra an' she try to carry it in
the house.
     Heh, he looked at 'er.  He said, "I'll tell ya what ya do."
Said, "Come here."  Said, "Great goodness!  It's another fool!"
