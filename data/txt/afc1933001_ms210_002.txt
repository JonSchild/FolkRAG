July 2, 1938.
Mr. John A. Lomax
c/o Thomas Cook and Sons,
2 Place de la Madelaine, 
Paris, France.
Dear Father:
A couple of my letters must have missed you somewhere 
because I have not been so neglectful as you think. 
Besides, as you yourself must admit, you must not been 
in Europe the most prolific of correspondents. I haven't 
written much to anyone except on business matters for a 
long time. Even Bess has been sadly neglected and I suppose 
this has been due to the fact that I have been fright-fully 
busy in a sort of routine way and I have no particular 
news to tell anyone.

Before I go, I expect to have the textual side of the 
book complete, with Mrs. Seeger's work so well laid
out for her that there will be nothing further to do
in regard to the book by the end of the summer except
to write notes and introduction.  I hope that you will
be in Washington so that we can work on the introduction
together, but if not, I think we can bang one out
in a couple of weeks through the mails.

The notes, which should certainly go in, should amount
to about a month's part time work and I am willing to
engage in it.  I would like, though, to do it all at
once, in a piece, with the design of the book very much
in mind so that the book will read easily from page to
page with as much connection made between songs and sections
as possible.  Before I go away, I will lay the
book out and take the lay-out with me and think about
it over the summer and do as much writing as I have time
for.  So much for the book.
