Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have delved tentatively into the 
problems implicit in our conversation 
of last Saturday and have come out, so 
far, with only vague answers. I think 
it best that I plan to see you when I 
come to Washington next week. I hope 
you will save some time for me.

Cordially yours,
Moses Smith
