PROGRAM

MUSIC OF EARLY AMERICA
ODE ON SCIENCE ------ Jezaniah Sumner (1754-1836)
Americans in Revolutionary times as well as today sang their determination to fight
for freedom: "All haughty tyrants we disdain," and shout, "Love Live Americay!"

BIRDS' COURTING SONG
This early children's ballad still sung today tells why the blackbird turned black,
and how the woodpecker got a red head.

SONG OF THE SEA ------ William Billings (1746-1800)
Tanner, singing school teacher and patriot, Billings was also the most daring of our
early composers. His one eye, lame leg and thunderous manner marked him as an
eccentric, but the vivid imagery of his songs cause them to be sung in country
"singing" even today. Here he depicts a sea voyage, storm, calm and safe arrival.

THE DEAF WOMAN'S COURTSHIP
One of many "answering' songs used in country gatherings.

LINK O'DAY
A runaway slave sings of the Underground Railway, which will carry him to freedom
before the "link o'day", or, daybreak.

CHILDREN'S GAMES
Played on streets and in backyards from Maine to California; Itiskit Itaskit; Little
Sally Sand; It Rains and It Pours, Here Come Three Merchants.

49'ers SONGS
a. THE UNCONSTANT LOVER
Many a girl crossed the "o-hi-o" just to forget a pioneer heart-breaker.
b. HO FOR CALIFORNIA
Foster's "Camptown Races" was so popular that Abolitionists crossing the prairies
set these verses to it.

AMERICANS AT WORK
CAPE COD GIRLS
The men of the early New England whalers which sailed the seven seas sang at their
work.

PAT WORKS ON THE RAILWAY
Irish laborers who built the Union Pacific, sang of beer, bugs and Yankee bosses.
