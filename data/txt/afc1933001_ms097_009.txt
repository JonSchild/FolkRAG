Dear Mr. Lomax:

    Dr. Spivacke showed me your comments on the folk song
albums. I am glad to know they meet with your
approval. The accompanying notes were written in an appre-
ciative vein and will serve to underscore some of the intrin-
sic values of the records that might otherwise be missed by
the casual listener.

    Since the beginning of the new year it begins to look
as if we shall have need of all available equipment for
current wartime recording expeditions. Would you be so kind
as to ship us the recording machine which you have, so that
we may overhaul it and put it into active use?

    Thank you for your brief formal report on your second
trip to the panhandle of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. We are
looking forward to receiving the records and field notes. We
recently had a request for copies of the records you made at
Boley Oklahoma. On the last shipment five or six records
arrived broken. The enclosed packing instructions might be
of use to you.

    With best wishes to you and Miss Terrill,
    Faithfully yours,

    B.A.Botkin
