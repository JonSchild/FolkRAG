Fry Bread

When I Graduated from Grammar
School it was a common thing
To Sign your friend's autograph books.
And end up by writing "Yours 
"Till Hitler gets Hungry; and fries
Turkey in Greece.
I suppose he havent gotton hungry
yet.

Today, because of the Japs
and Germans we have to take so 
many years of moathy phisics
Funds [eniencaty?] of Shops, Fund
enlots of electricity.
