1. "Oh I'm gonna hit somebody"
"Mama, don't hit nobody"
"No don't hit nobody"
"Yes gonna hit somebody"
Dis year, another year
I may be gone
2. "   "       "  in de lonesome grave
I may be gone.
Dat ain't no gotta chance on me
"        "      "    "            "         "   "
3.  I'll be walkin in de Beulah land
Dat ain't gotta no chance on me
4.  Hey hey hey de gangs still here
What de hell do we care
   "        "    "    "    "      "
What de hell we care bout it now
