BJ: We was speakin' about Laura Lloyd, this white woman that
had the colored child?  Well, that was down in Fitzgerald; I
knew that.  An' um, 'cause they was, you know, won'erin' whose
kin's chil' it gonna be when it be bo'n, 'cause then she was. . .
had anything.  Anybody she wants have, know? She didn' have --
she was jus' her brothers an' her.  [in, in] At, at the house,
an' the ol' man, the daddy or the gran'daddy, one.  He was a
