Dear Mr. Clark:

I appreciate very much your permission to reprint in "Cowboy
Songs and Other Frontier Ballads" your versions of "Bury Me Not On The
Lone Prairie", "The Cowboy" and "Great Grandad." You are correct in saying
that I wish only to print the words and the melody, leaving out your
special musical arrangements. We are following this plan throughout the
entire book as we did in the American Ballads.

I called to see you at your old address some time ago and was
disappointed that I didn't have time to follow you uptown.

By the way, among the new Cowboy songs which the revised
edition will contain is the words and music of a lovely melody which I
secured from a half-breed Indian woman in Western Oklahoma. The words
are as distinctive as the music. The chorus runs,

"Rain or shine
Sleet or snow
Me and my doney gal
is bound to go."

The word "doney" means sweetheart and his doney gal is the only sweetheart
that the singer has. I think this song might have a chance of a good run
as a piece of sheet music. Would you be interested in seeing a copy or
would you be good enough to make some suggestions.

Thanking you again for your letter, I am

Yours sincerely,


John A. Lomax
