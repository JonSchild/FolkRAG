Dear Miss Whitfield:
Alan reports that a lot
of work will be required on
your manuscript before it will
be in shape for submission to
a publisher. He has the manuscript
in Washington, c/o Music
Division, Library of Congress. Perhaps
you might as well write
him what you would consider a
fair division of [?] for revising
the book and finding a
publisher.
Sincerely yours,
Joan A. Lomax
