Fr:  ...   too smart to go in the henhouse.
RH: ... and the chickens froze to death right there back when
I was a kid, in the pine trees up there at the spring, and they fell
off every one dead.
Fr:  ...these too smart to go in the henhouse. .Had to go up a 
tree.
RH: The trees what  ...  them, and a lot of 'em back then
didn't have no henhouse, a tree's all they had.
Fr: That's all they had.
RH: Yeah.
Fr: My grandpa, he said that the reason the turkeys went so high up
in the trees is so the air, you know, ...
wouldn't be so cold
RH: Now, about all the chickens I see'd in the mountains and all
their toenails was gone.
Fr: Yeah. ...  scratch ...
(laughter)
RH: No, ...  froze them off.
Fr: ... scratch on something (?) ...
(laughter continues)
RH: Scratch ...  and then when it got Spring Mother
took an old-timey iron and beat their toenails off and kept it busted to keep
'em sore so they couldn't scratch ... and garden up.
Fr: ...
RH: And then they sewed boots on 'em, and they wore that through.
