PLUMB THE LINE
"Plumb the Line" is a wonderful shout that tells about a person
who is already in the world of God, but may be doing something
that he shouldn't be doing. "Plumb the Line" means build up yourself
and get straight on the world of God and get straight in the
Christianity way. It means get together on the right road,
the straight way.
