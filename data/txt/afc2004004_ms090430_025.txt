The "parole" lease on a one year contract is the common practice. Cabin and free firewood are provided, the operating and maintenance costs advanced, and, depending upon the share arrangement, the work stock and implements provided.

With the increasing use of the tractor a variation in the routine has been introduced. The plowing is more quickly and cheaply done by the tractor, and the tenant is charged for the service from his share. The orthodox system of "furnishing" in the area requires a commissary on the plantation, from which the tenant or sharecropper is dispensed food and other essentials. The larger plantations in Bolivar County maintain stores or commissaries for their tenants. Some of them are open only at stipulated times, when the tenants come for their rations. Others, like the Knowlton store at Perthshire and the Delta and Pine Land Company stores at Scott, serve a community larger than their tenants, and are open at regular hours every day. 

"Furnishing" as a credit system has several variations in all of which the landlord gives his tenants allowances for living expenses during the crop production period. These expenses are charged against the tenants and payable at the harvest saeson. This allowance is made in three general forms. The first is establishing a stated amount of credit for the tenant. The landlord allows the tenant to purchase commodities of a definite value. He may get groceries to the value of $12, for example. This type of furnishing is frequently termed a "limit". The second type is simply supplying groceries and necessities to a tenant during the crop production season. IN this type of furnishing the tenant does not know the money value of what he is receiving or, to be more exact, does not know what he is being charged for it. This system is called "rationing", and what the tenant receives is "rations"
