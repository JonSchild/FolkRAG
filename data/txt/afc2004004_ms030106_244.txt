JR made the first jazz arrangements for dances [o]in 1912,- ( all the arrangements
up to then were either rags or for the thearre)- simply a matter of
writing down what was playing- none of them knew yet why they are doing
what they are doing.
There [n]were no rhythmic figures used against the hot tunes then.
He couldn't find anyone to take JR's stuff down- Henry Clockman ( arranger
for Will R[i]ossiter)- a publishing house couldn't do this.  The first published hot arrangement
was the Jelly Roll Blues.  The Brass bands began to play it hot all
over the country- it was cons[d]idered the hottest band arrangement at that
time.  James Reese Europe featured it on his European tour- made himdelf
famous with it. [*still alive in Chicago- ?? ???? leader Dave Peyton's syncopators at present o?? ?  ??????? l???l*]  Henry [V]Clickman made the arrangement [*???? ??????? tune (Hysterics Rag) 1913*] fro JR's piano score.
Dave Peyton, [*poss R. M.*] Clarence Jones and W[o]ill Dorse[l]y said what JR put down was
wrong but they couldn[)]'t correct it.  They argued for days and days but
couldn't prove anything on him.
