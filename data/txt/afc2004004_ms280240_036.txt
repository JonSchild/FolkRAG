one thing and another and that.
(When you'd go to these fairs, you'd stay aroundthere
for how long?)
I would stay right round the whole day.
(There would be a fair that would last a day and what
would you do then - go into the woods?)
No, I went. . .aye, and I'd go right to the. . .to get a lie
down somewhere, maybe in some of the, of the haylofts. And
then I'd go to thenext fair. The next fair maybe happened
next day, that happened to be another walk and then we'd walk
through the night a bit to that. It was. . .If it was a good
distance to go till, say about five miles from that - fair
to the next one. So you met in with a different class of
plume and there again and a different class of fairm
servants there, at thatnext fair. There were none alike. No.
Oh no, oh no, no, no, there was no' alike, there was different
different types of fairm servants at everywhere. . .you could
tell. In factthey were different natures - different natured.
Well, I mean to say that some people, some fairm servants
you couldna              anything, oh he wouldna give you a 
drink at a'. You'd be singing the whole day and they
would hardly. . .they wouldna look at you. So in the next, the
next place, the next fair you go to you couldna go wrong.
You get as much drink and as much money as you like. . . as
much drink as you like to knock over. And pies, and a'
that kind of stuff. There was stalls selling pies, and
lemonade and one thing and another, you see, at that time.
