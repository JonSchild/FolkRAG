May 30, 1933.
Dear Mr. Engel:
Many thanks for your
great news!  Please use
what pressure is wise to
rush the machine along.
I shall be ready to take
the field in ten days, but
will of course wait and
do other things until I have
your fine machine to do my
recording.  Write to me here
after at Lubbock, Texas c/o Gerard Blinny.  Thanks a thousand
times.
Yours always sincerely,
John A. Lomax
