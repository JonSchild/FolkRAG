Port-of-Spain, Trinidad

Dear Alan:

Just a note from your sweltering home town to tell
you that one of my ex-colleagues, Dr, Gerald Freund,
and I will be in Port-of-Spain all too briefly from
the late afternoon of August 16 through mid-day of
the 18th, on the off-chance that you and Tony may be 
close by to Port-of Spain.

We would of course enjoy having a relaxed discussion
with you over a mid-day or evening meal. Please do
not make any special effort to be in Trinidad if your
work schedule has you elsewhere at the time. Hoping
a get together is possible, all the best,

Sincerely yours,



John P. Harrison
Director
