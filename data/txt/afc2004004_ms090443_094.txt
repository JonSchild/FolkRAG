AL: How long did you stay with her?
WB: I stayed up there with them nearly five years.  And then I went and
I started to work in the back kitchen as the back flunky.  I worked back
there about 26 or 27 days.  Then she put me up in the front.  That was the
white dining room.  She put me in the front as the back waiter. You say
it like that.

AL: What does the back flunky do?
WB: He is the last man.  He has to pick up everything, has to clean out
everything, tote it [ov]all over the place, and things in the kitchen, to the
dishwasher and like that.  And then when she moved me away from there, she 
put me up in the front as the back waiter.  They used metal plate[d]s and 
trays in the back but they used glass in the front.  I went up there and I 
picked them up.  Then in about a month or two months, something like that,
she made me the second waiter in the front.  We had white bell-bottomed caps,
white pants and a white coat, a white shirt, and a black bow tie.  You
had [?]to be neat to be up there, you know, and clean.  [Donny Brakshon(?).]
The head waiter was named Donny Brakshon (?).  He got killed and she
moved me up to the head waiter.  I went up there to the front.  Well I
always tried to learn and know everything, learn everything that I could
from anybody.  I went on up in the front there and I'd make chicken salad 
and puddings and pies and different things, you know.
John Billup, he was the baker.  I'd go back in the kitchen at night--
he'd do his baking at night.  He'd make up his bread in the day and he'd
put it in the pan and grease it to let  it rise and make donuts and all
like that, you know, cinnamon rolls.  I'd go back in there with him
