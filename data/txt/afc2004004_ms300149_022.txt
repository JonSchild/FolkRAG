Dear alan:
I thought perhaps I should
write you. I have never rec. any word
at all. from within the company you sold
the last songs to. As you, you said in your
last letter I would an should get a check in
July, and alan I hate to bother you so much
I know you are buisy[?] but thought perhaps
you didn't even know. I did git a Writers
Royalty Statement from the Progresive Music 
Company. in June. also august. but just the
statement showing how much was due
me. No check. I am so very ignorant about
such things. I don't even know if maybe
they is just send the checks at the end of the
year or quarterly. but had up to July goten
a check with the statement. there are several
of my friends who would love to have the
childrens songs record which is out. but altho
if I had them here could sell them. I cant
afford to order them - don't have the money
to pay.- have been with out work for some
weeks now. so am pretty badly Broke
the record shops here dont carry the folk
song records.- would you tell me how to order
them for the people out here in ark who want
this one. well here is something in a more pleasant
strain. have found seviral more beautifull
old Balods, some of them are realy good an
so Dr Wolfe says. he was out to visit me
this last week. I shall try to visit them in
