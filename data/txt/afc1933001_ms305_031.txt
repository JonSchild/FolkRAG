people who came from comfortable 
homes and had scarcely heard of the
labor movement it was a distinct 
shock to learn that they, just like 
any other students in labor schools 
run on the co-operative basis, 
were expected to do chore work. 
Wash dishes, mop floors, and clean 
privies! It would not have been surprising 
to hear kicks. There weren't any.

     The significance in all this for us, 
was, the discovery that in place 
like the Highlander Folk School it is 
possible to accomplish in two weeks 
three times as much as you can do in
a classroom in New York City in an 
entire semester. 

      What is the reason? Of course the 
spirit, the free and natural fellowship 
within the group, not as between 
students and teachers but between
individuals of richly diversified backgrounds. 
Where you wash dishes together, 
study together, and have fun 
together in the evenings with songs 
and square dances, it just isn't possible 
to be formal or unresponsive!

      Stimulation from the environment, 
contact with many developments both 
of regional and national importance 
such as the TVA, also played a great 
part. Not just as a feeling of excitement 
and thrill, but actually in providing 
subjects for writing. The 
journalism class benefitted most. We 
went one day in the truck, and all-day 
trip, to see the Chickamauga Dam, 
the nearest one of the great chain of 
TVA dams now under construction. 
On the same day, as we had to pass 
through Chattanooga, the American 
Newspaper Guild there had arranged 
to take us through the plant of the 
Chattanooga "Times." All three of 
the Chattanooga papers now have 
Guild contracts, and the newspaper-
men often attend week-end conferences 
at Highlander. 

        The class in reportage wrote 
articles on the day nursery, interviews 
with Myles Horton and Dillard 
King, the Workers alliance county 
president. Creative writing courses 
also felt the productive effect on surroundings, 
especially in poetry. 
Verses came tumbling. Some of it 
surprisingly good stuff.

         The drama class wanted to do a 
living newspaper. But this turned out 
to be impractical for the group as a 
whole, since all were not advanced 
enough for such a job. So it was decided 
that four people who could 
qualify, including two of the Highlander 
staff, would work on the newspaper 
after hours—a double-up job 
for the class teacher! For our material 
we took a strike situation of the 
winter before.

Dillard King came every evening
to give help with details.  Last winter,
when the politicians of the reactionary
local machine decided to end the
WPA road project in Grundy County,
cutting off 700 families, the WPA
workers went on a sit-down strike.
And won.  Down South where families
are big—700—that's almost the
entire population! "First time in history,"
Dillard King says, "workers
ain't strikin' for higher wages. But
JOBS!" He cradled them. Quietly,
but determined, they sat down in the
government office, and asked the
sheriff for deputies to protect government
property.  They were already
wise to the tactics the T.C.I.-controlled
politicians would try to put
over through their stooges, damaging
property and destroying records to
make a Federal case out of the strike.
The people had just elected this sheriff
and had confidence in him.  The
sheriff appointed the union leaders as
deputies.  Meanwhile, donations of
food and money began to come in.
The strike had the support of the
local merchants, who knew you can't
sell your stuff if nobody can buy it.
Somebody sent the strikers a ton of
coal—and they furnished fuel to the
office bosses locked up with them!
One man who had a furniture store
said, "You-all going to need some
mattresses and army cots to sleep on.
Take anything out of my store you 
want!  Just don't break nothing.
Lemme have it back when you're
through."  The strike lasted eleven
days.  Then a labor relations representative
flew down from Washington.
The project was ordered to continue,
and 500 families had their jobs
restored.  The remaining 200, including
Dillard King and all the leaders,
are still out.

After that, the machine politicians
tried another dodge.  They decided to
"economize," and cut the sheriff's
salary down under twenty-five dollars
a month.  Well, he was their sheriff,
working for them instead of Tennessee
Coal & Iron—the people weren't
going to let him resign.  Or starve to
death, either.  They passed the hat
and paid his salary.

"Boys," said Dillard King, "we
seen what we can do.  When we elect
our own people to office!" That's the
keynote sounded in the living newspaper.
If the financing can be worked 
out, it will be toured over other parts
of the state with a troupe of performers,
recruited from Grundy
Country's unemployed, for the election
campaign in 1940.
