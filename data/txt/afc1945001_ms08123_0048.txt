Rumors
People who spread rumors may
accidentally sink a ship, railroad trains, 
or let important information slip.
In a magazine I read, a soldier
told his mother he was going to get
his uniform press + that
he was leaving sunday night
for places unknown. His mother
told a neighbor, the neighbor told
a friend, the friend a tailor and
the tailor let it slip that
the soldier was having 30 suit 
pressed + was sailing to India. 
This rumor got around to 
the wrong person + a ship was 
sunk. This all happened 
because of a little rumor that 
was spread by people who 
didn't stop and think.
A slip of the lip will sink
a ship.
