BJ TAPE 26, p.14

unto, to do nothin' with.  Because she got a friend, too.  An'...
TL:  She what?
BJ:  She has a friend...Yeah, she has a friend.  I mean somebody
else, besides myself bein' a friend to her.  What I do along with
her today, I'm afraid if, if I was to do anything along with her today
an' I had a husband or a good friend, she gonna leak it out.  Some-
where.  I be afraid she leak it out somewhere.  So, therefore, prove
yourself.  Ya see?  That's all.  Ya be with them, they say, "Oh, chil',
I wouldn't do it; I's afraid...You come on with me; you can do it
an' ain' nobody gonna ever know nothin' about it.  That'll be in 
me all my life.:  Y-y-yeah.  An' you...you never know.
TL:  Ellen was at you all your life to do that?
BJ:  I said, no, I said, the people may tell you that.  That you
come on an' do this or that or the other with them.  I mean a
woman.  An', "You can go with this man or that man.  Slip an' your
husban'll never know it.  I never say nothin' about it."  But
don't you trust that.  [See?]  Don't trust it.  An' you may ever w-
wanta do them things so bad, an' may will do it.  But you jus'
say, "No, I ain' gonna do it.  I got, got a, got a husban'; my
husband is my..."
     "I ain't gonna git -- Who gonna know it?"  An' all that
kinda stuff.
     I say, "No."  If the man is there an' every thing an' he
tryin' to git ya an' he tell ya, "She my friend!," just part it
right up.  'Cause you name -- you's gone right there!  'Cause two, three
know it right then.  See?  You, yourself, an' her an' him.  See?
An' but, if you was to do anything, ah, like that, I, I have told
guys[, said,] I didn't have nobody in this world.  An' they send me
word by, by womens.  "I like you," an all that kinda mess.
