Dear Pipe-Major Ross

I am responding to your kind note to Hugh Macphee and 
also writing you on my behalf to thank you for 
the help you gave me in Edinburgh. Actually, at that 
time, I did not understand about the BBC rules for 
fees and thought I was just following my usual 
custom of collecting folklore. Nevertheless, I have 
asked the BBC Contracts Department to send a contract 
to both you and John Burgess.

If there is to be any use for your marvellous piping 
in my albums to be published in the United States, 
I will contact you separately about this at a later 
date.

With all kind regards and great respect
I am
      Sincerely yours

              (Alan Lomax)
