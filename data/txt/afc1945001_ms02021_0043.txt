in the political life of nations such as England and the United 
States in the future. Many are of the opinion that it will be 
for the better and that there will be proper regulation by the 
Government of such matters as concern the lot of the average 
citizen. Many feel have a socialist government.

Conversation recently between two businessmen in regard to 
consideration being given by various federal activities to the 
post-war era. One gentleman was of the opinion that there had 
been a duplication of efforts in the past by several federal 
agencies and he was firmly of the opinion that planning along 
such lines, at the present time, was somewhat premature in view 
of the serious condition in which the nation finds itself today. 
It was the opinion of both that we should try to win the war 
instead of planning what we were going to do afterward; that 
the uppermost thought in everyone's mind should be toward the 
successful prosecution of the war; that we will have plenty of 
time later on when things are going a little better as to what 
we should do with our post-war problems.
