[The best year]
They were jealous of how much
drink we had - sometimes there'd
be trouble - because we were all together
& they wd make noise
The gtest thing that knocked
the mi s out was the dart board
and the singing - dartboard did
away with a lot of Xmas ideas
and feelings. People liked to
play darts now Xmas time.
Piano ace. , two tomb,
pair of bones

Chor W -
On Up to the Rigs
That song was in print.
I bot the song on a race course -
and I was goin to school, wind -
from an old man who was
going round sellin songs
