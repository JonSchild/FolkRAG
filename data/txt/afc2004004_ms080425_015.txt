Uncle Bob:    I don't know what he had, but they had gold in
them days-- my grandpappy had a gold mine.   Had a section
of land they found gold on grandpappy's place and the
Doffits,who live in there tried to take it away from
him from grandpappy . . . . My daddy bought the claim from the
Doffits back them days.  And as they found gold on the
land in Arbacoochie, (half a section of the land had lots
of gold on it), they tried to take it away from him. . .it
stayed in the law there for four years and they put
grandpappy up before a court and judge and says "your
name Phillip Denson," he says "yes sir".   And then asked
him questions about his property and asked him "Mr. Denson,
what year were you born?"    He says "I was born the same 
year as Queen Victoria of England".   The lawyer said,
"Judge, have the defendent answer the question."   He
says "he told you already."   Left it to him to know
when Queen Victoria was born.   Then they put my Uncle
William, my daddy's oldest brother, on the stand.   Says,
"your name William Denson?"   Says "yes sir."  Says is the
defendent here your father?"   Says " my mother says he is."
And I was telling that at old Edwardsville, used to be
the county seat of Cleveland, you know, and they used to
laugh about it and the judges and lawyers say Judge, [how] have 
the witness answer my question?    All I know about it
