Dear Father:

Enclosed is an amusing note for you from John Hix.

I think you still don't understand the Columbia situation.  Burl Ives is using your songs only because you have given Columbia permission to let him use them, but he certainly is giving all of our books good advertising in his answers to all the fan mail.  He is possibly the most popular folk-song singer on the air now.  I think if you are nice and polite to the Columbia people they will be willing to make some kind of adjustment on the songs.

I have just received a letter from Mrs. Tartt saying "If the weather continues good we might record easily until Christmas.  If rains set in early however there are several good neighborhoods of congregational singing that we could not make.  If date has to be decided on immediately, it might be safer to say spring."

The memo is now ready to go through and I will await your decision by wire as to whether you are willing to undertake the trip at this late date.  The decision about the weather in that region is up to you.  I apologize for the eternal delay, but I have literally done nothing else for the last ten days but try to get those memos approved in advance.

Elizabeth and I are living in a tourist room and both working very hard.  We'd like to have news of you and Deanie.  How is your book coming?

Much love,
Alan
