Save the scrap to slap the Japs.

There was a young man who  was called
to go to the Army. He didn't want to go
so he said , I'm going to fool these doctors
during my eye examination. The time was
set for his examination and the doctors
and nurses began with their test. Every
thing the doctors put before his eyes
he couldn't see a thing so the doctor
told the nurse to remove her dress and
asked the patient what did he see he
said he saw nothing. So the doctor asked
the nurse to remove another piece, and
he still said he saw nothing. The doctor
said you may not see nothing but
you indicator is pointing straight to 
Fort Dix you are in the Army now.
