The Institute of Folk Music
University of North Carolina

Publication:

We have prepared a selection of traditional songs, 
ballads, hymns, and singing games which will be published 
by The University of North Carolina Press if enough advance
orders are given to justify publication.

The First Series will contain these materials:
Foreward: (2nd sheet herewith).
Explanation of the tunes: 
(the seven-shape notation,
the seven modes, method
of teaching folk songs, &c.)

Children's Songs:
Go Tell Aunt Rhody
Cook Robin
Froggy Went A-courting
Billy Boy
The Cakum in the Woods
The Good Old Man
The Miller and His Sons

Singing Games:
The Farmer in the Dell
Draw a Bucket of Water
There Stands a Lady
Wind Up the Gum tree
A-hunting We Will Go
Weevily Wheat
We Won't Go Home Until Morning

Ballads:
The Mary Golden tree
Barbra Allen

Scared Songs:
On Christmas Day in the
Morning
The Twelve Blessings of Mary

(This list may be subject to slight changes.)

We are planning to use seven-shape notation in order
that the many Southern communities and families familiar
with this traditional notation may find the book of greatest
practical use. The shape-notes will in no way detract from
the book's value to teachers who read "round notes".

If you are interested in this First Series, which will
be published this Fall if enough advance orders are received,
please communicate with The U.N.C Press at once.

The price will [?] per copy.
