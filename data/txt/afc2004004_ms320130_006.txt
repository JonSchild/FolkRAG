Tape 854, Alan Lomax

A. LOMAX (to camera)
The purpose of this evening is to establish the French
connection for American culture.  The background for rich
new music that's coming pouring out of Louisiana in the form
of Fais Do-Do's and Zydeco's and the absolutely effevescence
of marvelous dance songs and ballads that's beginning to 
flow and build a whole new culture in New England states and
Canada.   It's often forgotten that the French culture is as
basic to this continent as Spanish or the British tradition.
In a way, it was one of the first.  The Coureau De Voir
(sp?) ran across the whole northern half of the continent
singing as they went and opened the whole thing up, and it's
their heritage which has penetrated deep into the
Mississippi Valley and Louisiana and we'll hear it bubbling
in their song.
 
The Smithsonian has commisioned John. . .Williams?

J. WRIGHT
Wright.

A. LOMAX
John Wright. I'm terrible with names.  John Wright, who's an
Englishman but a specialist in French folklore, to assemble
a group of people from the part of France that most fostered
the development of American music, and after many years of 
research by Mr. Wright and his colleagues and Katrin
Carriere. . .we have with us a bevy of French fiddlers and 
dancers and accordion players that are going to make the
connection for us between the music-the French music that we
have in this country and it's ancient sources in the country
music of France.   Mr. Wright, of course, knows all about
this, I'm just a stranger, and he'll tell us about it in a 
few words and we'll then go on with the music.   John? . . .  Are
we on? . . .Are you on? . . .And now Mr. Wright, a fiddler and
musicologist from England who is one of the major workers in
the field of the French folksong revival and a great fiddler
himself as I've heard today and a . . .would you tell us a
little bit about the group here, just briefly?

J. WRIGHT
Well, these people are part of the group we brought over, we
brought twenty five people over from several different
French provinces.  And what we thought tonight we would
especially show the people from the Western provinces
because that's where most of the people that came to America
came from.   We have people from Poitou and Anjou, we have a 
fiddler from Vendee, Maxima Rambeau, with a very old style.
