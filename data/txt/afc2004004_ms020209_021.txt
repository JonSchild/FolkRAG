Come get out of the way- boys, Quick get out of the way.- You'd better
watch what you say- boys, Better watch what you say, We've
rammed in your harbor- we've tied to your port, and our pistols are hungry- and our tem-pers are
short, So bring your daughters a- round to the fort 'Cause we're the 
Cops of the World boys, We're the Cops of the World.

2. We pick and choose as we please, boys
Pick and choose as we please
You'd best get down on your knees, boys
You'd best get down on your knees
We're hairy and horny and ready to shack
And we don't care if you're yellow or black
Just take off your clothes and lay down on
your back
'Cause we're the cops of the world, boys,
we're the cops of the world.

3. Our boots are needing a shine, boys
Our boots are needing a shine
But our coca cola is fine, boys
Coca cola is fine
We've got to protect all our citizens fair
So we'll send a battalion for everyone there
And maybe we'll leave in a couple of years
'Cause we're the cops of the world, boys,
we're the cops of the world.

4. And dump the Reds in a pile, boys
Dump the Reds in a pile
You'd better wipe off that smile, boys
Better wipe off that smile
We'll spit through the streets of the cities
we wreck
And we'll find you a leader that you can elect
Those treaties we signed were a pain in the neck
'Cause we're the cops of the world, boys,
we're the cops of the world.

5. And clean the johns with a rag, boys
Clean the johns with a rag
If you like you can use your flag, boys
If you like you can use your flag
We've got too much money, we're looking for toys
Guns will be guns and boys will be boys
But we'll gladly pay for all we've destroyed
'Cause we're the cops of the world, boys,
we're the cops of the world.

6. And please stay off of the grass, boys
Please stay off of the grass
Here's a kick in the ass, boys
Here's a kick in the ass
We'll smash down your doors, we don't bother to 
knock
We've done it before so why all the shock
We're the biggest and toughest kids on the block
'Cause we're the cops of the world boys,
we're the cops of the world.

7. And when we've butchered your sons, boys
When we've butchered your sons
Have a stick of our gum, boys
Have a stick of our bubblegum
We own half the world, oh say can you see
And the name of our profits is Democracy
So like it or not you will have to be free
'Cause we're the cops of the world, boys,
we're the cops of the world.
