TAPE: 239A Sacred Harp
Interview with the Rev. Charles Creel
[*about 5 mins. into tape*]
AL: We're talking to Rev. Charles Creel, who is retired, but
still is running a nice herd of cattle out in the country near
Jacksonville, Alabama. Rev. Creel has had a deep experience in
life and has a lot to say to us about Sacred Harp and many
other things....... You really aren't particularly acquainted 
with the Holly Springs Church over there near Bremen...
Creel: No sir, that was my first trip over there. I knew
many of the people that were over there, in fact many of the
people that were there were relatives of mine, a sister,
a niece, a first cousin...
[*They repeat opening*]
AL; I think one off the things that Sacred Harp does is cross 
denominational lines. That's one ofthe important things, it 
brings people together, it brings all the churches together. 
Creel: That's right, there's no denomination boundaries any
where.
AL: That's very important in this country where people are
sometimes kind of narrow about their religion....
Creel: We have got to the point in our civilization , what
educated preachers call it, with more emphasis on denomination
than we do on the bible. But in the bible there is no
denomination. There's none listed. Now, there is a man what
was called John the Baptist, and I suppose that's where the 
Baptists got the name for the Baptist Church, but there's something
like 21 different branches of the Baptist Church, between the Prim.
Baptists, and the Missionary Baptists...................
Creel: I don't preach denomination.
