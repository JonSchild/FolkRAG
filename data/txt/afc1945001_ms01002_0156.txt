Dear Col. Donovan:

In spite of the immense amount of memos you probably
have to read I am still naive enough to think that I
can put down in writing a brief outline of an idea and
have that outline reach you by simply writing you this
letter.

Here is the idea –

It is human nature to want to repeat a story.
Why not take advantage of that human trait by
setting up an official Answerer of Rumors (call
him what you will) and have this official hear,
record, answer and report on rumors brought to
him by people who hear them from here, there and
everywhere.
This would allow the people to repeat what they
heard, would demonstrate to them the power of
rumor and would enable to government to watch
the spread of rumors and check on them more
closely.
The program would not be mandatory, it would
be voluntary – and each and every American would
be called on to help by doing something. Human
beings get greater satisfaction by helping when
they do something – it is not so easy to help
by refraining from doing something.

There are, of course, many angles to this suggestion
and, after some little thought, I believe they could 
be worked out satisfactorily.

As a matter of fact, I would like to help you set up
such a system or help in any other way I can. It happens
that my experience has been in a combination of jobs
that fits me to do a good piece of work in gathering
information and in influencing the public mind.

Here, in brief, is my experience – Newspaper reporter for
The Rochester Journal and The Detroit News; Public Relations
for Michigan's Attorney General and at another time for
Michigan's State Administrative Board; Market Research
