Dear Mr. Redfield:

I have read with considerable interest your good exposition
of August 18th.

At the present time we have no funds whatsoever for
the support of outside projects nor is it likely that we will
have anything until well after September 1st. Then, when we
do, the total amount of money available for the support of all
projects everywhere will not quite equal the lesser sum of 
$4,000. set forth in your letter in connection with Plan No. 1.
Therefore, it will be impossible for us to contemplate either
of your plans in their entirety.

On the subject of rumors -- while we were late in 
getting started, we have now made a beginning and do not feel
that we need additional private assistance.

The general subject of war attitudes of various classes
of people we are, of course, continuously receiving from polls
and surveys and special voluntary reporters, although perhaps not
in such depth in the city of Chicago as your group's project would
provide. Nevertheless, an important part of the national sample
is always located in Chicago and we do have something from there.
In any case, limitation of funds indicates that the second portion
of your Plan No. 1 does not have a high priority rating.

The study of attitudes among high school and junior college
students is something that we are not getting at the present
time. It is completely unduplicated in our own efforts and would,
in my opinion, although I have not consulted my associates about 
it, be valuable.

The study of the Chicago Tribune would not be high on
our priority rating either.
