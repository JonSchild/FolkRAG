Glenrose, Texas, September 8, 1940.

[Next door to The Cabin]
In the cabin next to Professor Gaines
lived B. F. Head, a sixty-five [65] year old "stove up"
cowboy from near Breckenridge,
Texas. He was in Glenrose trying
to boil out [the] rheumatism with
the hot sulphur water that flows
out of the many [artesian] artesian wells
of that section.
He hobbled over and sang and
talked about Cole Younger.
