    # Mr. D. G. Hawkins, white man, used to sing it when he'd come out to the mule lot in the mornin'
I carried my gal to the movie one night
In a brand new Chevrolet
Every time I went to shift my gear
Her big feet was in the way
                     --
Gonna git rid of this Lincoln
Git me a Cadillac Eight
When I start to get crooked
Nobody can keep me straight
                      --
I'm a rowdy soul, rowdy soul
Let's go down to the party-o.
