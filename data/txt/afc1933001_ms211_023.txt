for your Christmas. This is merely
an example of how
you do not hold up your
end of a correspondence
which I do not wish to
be a burden to you. With
the evidence before me there
is left but one thing for
me to do. I am not registering
any complaint, though
you will smile at this
disclaimer.

Mrs. Mason works in
the Library of Congress, a most
gracious West Texas Texas-Ex. Keep
your belly-band drawn tight
when you read her letter. And
you'd like her too if you
could run up to see her.

Lovingly always, 
Father
