Dear Mr. _________:
Subject: Formation of a Local Rumor Clinic
Thank you for your letter advising us that you and 
your associates are about to initiate a program for the local
analysis of rumors.
This is an important community undertaking and, in
war time, one which requires a proper understanding of the nature
of rumors, their cause, and their cure. The Office of 
War Information has formulated a guide for the analysis of oral
communication which it is prepared to send to qualified local 
organizations engaged in this work.
Before sending a guide, the Office of War Information 
must be apprised of the sponsorship, supervision, and responsibility 
of your local organization. Towards this end, [and] 
we request your response to the attached questionnaire.
On receipt of the requested information, we will forward 
an adequate supply of the guide which you can circulate to
those engaged in the effort. OWI will gladly provide continuing
guidance and consultation and will work with your organization
in a reciprocal relationship which will give OWI the benefit
of your local rumor analyses and you the benefit of our [experience] study
[in the analysis] of verbal communications since Pearl Harbor.
Sincerely yours,
Attachment
