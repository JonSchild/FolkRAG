Down in the valley
Where the green grass grows
Where Mary Gray
She grows like a rose.

She grows, she grows,
She grows so sweet
That she calls for her lover
At the end of the street.

Sweetheart, sweetheart,
Will you marry me?
Yes, love, yes, love
At half-past three.

Ice cakes, spice cakes,
All for ten,
And we'll have a wedding
At half-past three.

Pump, pump, here comes the taxi cab
Pump, pump, here comes the taxi cab
Pump, pump, here comes the taxi cab
Ready for the wedding at half-past three.

Charlie Chaplin went to France
To teach the ladies how to dance
This is the way he taught them
First to heel
Then to toe
Thro ye go big-birlie-o.

O alla tinka, to do the rumba,
O alla tinka do the
