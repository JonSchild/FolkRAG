Notes on Conference with Mr. J.A. Irving, Research 
Secretary, Committee on Morale (Canada) 
The meeting started at about 10:20 A.M., August 3rd, in 
Mr. Kane's office. Present were Messrs. Kane, DuBois, Likert, Pettee, 
Horowitz, and Mr. Irving. 

Irving called attention to the importance of rumor to them, 
citing the way in which a rumor closed up a munitions plant a whole 
week in one place, and the same rumor has gotten in the way of other 
plants elsewhere, closing others up for shorter periods -- four days, 
etc. This particular story concerns the woman working in a munitions 
plant who went to the beauty parlor apparently without getting all the 
powder removed from her hair. As soon as the permanent wave machine 
was attached to her head there was a big explosion; the girl died then 
and there. 

Administratively, the Committee for Morale is under Mr. Thorson, 
Minister of the Department of National War Services, and is one of his 
strategic advisory committees separate from the information disseminating 
group. The members of the Committee for Morale remain anonymous as 
far as the public is concerned in order to be more impressive. Mr. Kane 
outlined the Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of War Information. 
Mr. Irving indicated that there was a great deal of criticism of the 
literature put out by the Government claiming that it was propaganda 
to pull McKenzie King's political chestnuts out of the fire. There is 
a good deal of question as to whether King is the best war leader. 
Mr. Irving hopes to recommend a polling service to the Canadian Government 
in two weeks. They have available as the skeleton staff people 
who had been used by Opinion Surveys, Ltd., the original founders of 
which are now in the army.

A major problem is the question of leak of information through
the Canadian Parliament.  It has been suggested that a large part of
the Tobruk defeat was due to the knowledge made available to the public
both through the House of Commons in England and in both of the Canadian 
Houses of Parliament.

It seems that the Canadian equivalent to the Congressional Record
is called the Hansard, and in the July 16th issue the document had
printed in it to the extent of about 3/4 of an inch thickness detailed
information concerning production figures.  All this was due to the
continued questioning of one M.P.  Hansard is available both within and
without the country, at a cost of about $3.00 a year.  If the newspapers
were to print or an official to include in his speech the data
released in Hansard, he would be immediately incarcerated for the duration.

Some question arose concerning the possibility of bring congressmen
into the deliberations designed to get action.  At the present time
it was suggested Canada would be faced with revolution if they were to
try to enforce conscription.  One-third of Canada's population is in
the one Province, Quebec.  These people speak a Norman-Breton 16th or
17th Century dialect, with a culture which is not French, but 16th or
17th Century culture.  By religion they are Catholic, and economically
consider themselves underdogs.  They differ from the French Canadians
in New England in the sense of participation in the National economy.
