NEW ENGLAND RUMORS:

MASSACHUSETTS.
August 10, 1942.

Rumors from Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety

Sailors on merchantmen having to be forced on board.

Shore patrol boat unarmed and no radios.

Congress is not doing its job.

Administration in Washington is poor.

Air power is not sufficiently recognized.

Civilian defense has been muddled.

Gas ration tickets are being largely bootlegged.

Surrender of Tobruk was due to 5th column activity.

Rubber shortage is man made.  A Presidential order could provide manufacture of enough rubber by 1943 to supply all.

Russia will negotiate separate peach with Germany unless second front is opened immediately.

Gas is being sold at certain gas stations for five cents per gallon above standard price.

One hundred tank cars loaded with gas arrived at New York from the west, could not be sold at New York as there was so much gas available there was not any place to store it; these loaded tank cars then proceeded on to Boston where a market could not be found as there was plenty of gas here also, so the loaded tank cars were sent to Canada where the gas was disposed of.

The government gives out only 10% of the losses of the Army and Navy because of fear of the effect on the people.

New England is being discriminated against regarding fuel oil and gas  and people are frankly worried about fuel oil for the coming winter.

The United States can lose the war.

Russia is lost and she will  make a separate peace.

Briton will not fight.

Rumor has it there are too many spies on our armed services.

No relief intended for little businessmen.

All of the soldiers going over were taking along two rifles and two packs.  One is to be used by our boys and the other by the Free French when they arrive.
