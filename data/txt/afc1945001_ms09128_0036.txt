Anecdotes. 

A man who was very hungry
was going to the supper, he said he
was so hungry that he could eat a 
horse.  His wife told him to come
on and eat all that he wanted. 
While he was eating he told his son
to eat all the roast he wanted because 
he wouldn't know when he would get
any more not knowing that it was 
horse meat.  The boy told him that it
wasn't any roast, it was horse meat
he was eating and that he would be 
eating it for the rest of the year or more. 

A man went into a grocery store
showing the grocer a penny.  He said
it was left after paying all of his
income taxes and told the grocer to 
give him an all day sucker.
