He has the Cornish shape, mm, and the Cornish 
big head. He looks a little bit like ah, ah 
the hero of Lorna Doone, who -whats his 
name ah... John [ONE], the big man. 
Anyway, he's, he's the - he's of that south 
ah western corner of England, and he feels 
about music in a different way. He does music 
to please other people, and openly says so. 
And he also likes harmony a lot. He, his band 
has a, has a, a real rich harmonic quality 
that not all the bands have, and he is quite 
clearly playing with his people in a way that 
ah the normal ah bluegrass band doesn't play. 
He's really playing chords, he's rolling in 
- in a very - [ONE] it in a very 
rich way, and, and blowing his [ONE]
you know, really black style. Favourite number 
is a little old thing he remembers called 
Swing Low Sweet Chariot, which is sort of the 
ultimate, ah, mmm, chapterin our story. For 
him that's a folk song. Ah, he grew up as - 
- admiring D. Ford Bailey ah over the air. 
He has nothing but affection for black people
 and adores their music.
