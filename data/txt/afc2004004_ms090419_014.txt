other man was about to kill her, when she finally went to
Uncle Tom. He told her then, "If you'd been as much as two [weeks]
or three days longer you'd have been a dead woman." . . See, he
met her on the railroad and told the boys, say, "Put her down,"
say, "She can walk." They put her down. She say, "I can't walk."

When she say, "I can't walk, "Uncle Tom say, "You can
walk, "  and she come walking to him just like a newborn baby, just
toddlin to him, and , as she got to him, she straighten right up. . .
Sure enough, he taken her back in there into his office---
he didn't let nobody else back in there but him and her--- and she
showed him where the pain started from. Well, he put a plaster on
her side and, as the pain moved, that plaster, it would come loose,
until all the pain left and all the plaster finally fall off.

And she was completely well.

Oughta see her. Walkin aroun here just as fat as a Berkshire
hog. . .

Fine and pretty, man, fat and fine.
