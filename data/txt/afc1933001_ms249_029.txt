METHODISTS AND THEIR READING

EXPERIENCE AND THE CHRISTIAN
FATIH. BY HOWARD B. JEFFERSON.
(Abingdon-Cokesbury. Price $2.)
         Very early began the struggle in which
the followers of Jesus tried to distinguish
themselves from current Jewish sects. In
Saul of Tarsus it became a personal battle,
with Saint Paul winning out. Later he with-
stood Peter "face to face." Through the
centuries Christianity has had to negotiate
terms with contemporary life and thought. 
         Today these negotiations are going on in
more acute forms than ever. This well-writ-
ten books registers one expression of that
process. Its distinctive character lies in an
attempt to graft Christianity onto a natural-
istic pragmatism. The issue between the
two viewpoints are sharpened in an excellent
manner. A study of them leaves no doubt
that here a hybrid Christianity is in the mak-
ing. This volume is, therefore, a symbol of
vast changes in today's intellectual climate
toward Christianity. Just now it is not his-
toric Christianity which is guiding our experi-
mentation. The initiative has been taken by
naturalistic philosophies. That much is be-
coming increasingly clear.
         This book relies upon false antitheses: Tra-
dition against experimentalism, knowledge 
versus faith, Jesus versus Christ, and so on.
At the outset man is completely immersed in
a restricted scientific nature, and knowledge
is subsequently limited "to the way in which
experimentalism uses that term." Where-
upon faith becomes a kind of venture devoid
of knowledge. It must ground itself solely
in revelation. But where can revelation be
found? In the historic Jesus? No, because
the Gospels are already faith-interpretations.
Revelation comes by way of the Christian
tradition about "Christ and his Church."

GEORGE WASHINGTON'S WORLD.
BY GENEVIEVE FOSTER. (Scribner's
Sons. Price, $2.75.)
         The author spreads before us an inter-
esting panorama of persons and events in
the world during the days of George Wash-
ington. The book is divided into six parts,
each part including references to the lead-
ing individuals and the happenings of world
significance when Washington was a boy,
soldier, farmer, commander, citizen, and
finally President.
         In each section of the book there are
brief readable sketches of world history.  
Mrs. Foster writes "not only of political
events and personalities, but of the develop-
ment of science, industry, literature, and
art. The beginning of aviation, the discovery
of oxygen, electricity, the invention of the 
cotton gin, the reformation of scurvy and
smallpox, the reformation of the calendar,
all take their place in her picture of world 
events."
         The book was written for the author's
own children of high-school age. She realized
