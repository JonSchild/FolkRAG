Dear Mrs. Lomax:

    If you get a letter from your son saying
that he had a time of discouragement over his birthday,
it may be a comfort to you to hear that things are
"looking up"! The poor child said that yesterday it
seemed as if everything in the world were wrong. Boiled
down, the difficulty seemed to be that his League of
Nations Essay, although Mr. Tinker had praised it, was
not nearly so good as those written by several older
boys, and consequently could not be among those sent
over to Taft in competition for the prize. Also, Mr.
Tinker (who is deeply interested in Alan, and has him
down often at his house informally) had told Alan
frankly that his little play "Three Blind Mice" was
something which Alan himself would, a year from now,
be unwilling to claim as his own. Added to this, he
feared (though without justification - for the drawing
has not yet gone to the Brief Board) that his drawing
was not going to be excepted by the Brief. Added to
this, he was away from home on his birthday for the
first time in his life, and examinations begin on Monday!

    The form that Alan's desperation took was
staying away from dinner last night - which was an
easily explainable but not at all helpful method of
curing himself! However, we found him, later in the
evening, brought him over to our house, and fed him
belatedly on beefsteak and ice cream in front of our
living room fire; and he enjoyed so much the quiet "homey-
ness" of it that he said he guessed he should stay away
from dinner every night!

    Everything seems to be serene today, and
perhaps Alan will not even allude to his recent blue-
ness - but I thought, if he did, I would try to show
how it happened. The child is always down in the depths
or up in the heights, - and yesterday the depths prevailed.
