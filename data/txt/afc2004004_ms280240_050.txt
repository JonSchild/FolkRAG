With a roguish smile upon her face the lass answered me and said,
Kind sir, I'll go along with you, but you know that I'm afraid,
The paths they are so slipp'ry and the nights are cold and keen,
And you it wouldna do for me to fall down by the Maudlin Green.
With some king words and promises the lassie gave consent
We wandered here, we wandered there in lonely
place and beng, (on lovely pleasant hunt)
Day after day we met and roamed about yon lovely scene,
I'm afraid this maid had mony's a fall down by the Maudlin Green.
But soon my time for parting came, my ship she [hoisted] sail,
No long could I meet my girl and tell so pleasant tale
I sang farewell to old Dundee where happy I had been,
And I left my girl alone to walk down by the Maudlin Green.
As I lay my berth one night when weary watch was done,
I dreamed I was the father of a darling little son,
And there his mother right plainly it's there could be seen,
For she was weeping bitterly down by the Maudlin Green.
But when my boat put in again in the harbour Dundee,
I searched the town all up and down for my girl I can see
I'll ask her to forgive me for a rascal I have been,
And we wull make it up again down by the Maudlin Green.
