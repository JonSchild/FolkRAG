(COLRADO SEMINARY)
DENVER, COLORADO

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
SUMMER QUARTER                               February 10, 1941

Dr. John A. Lomax
Honorary Curator of Folk Songs
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Dr. Lomax:
   
   This is to confirm arrangements which you and 
Professor Davidson of our English Department have been
making though correspondence.

   As I understand it, you will be here on
Monday and Tuesday, July 21 and 22, as a contributor to
discussions in connection with our Conference on Western
Folklore.  In addition to the informal discussion periods,
Dr. Davidson has proposed that you appear before the
student assembly at ten o'clock on Tuesday morning to
present in a very informal manner some of your experiences
in connection with the assembling and other aspects of
folklore information.  This need not be a set speech.  Our
student assembly is attended by approximately one hundred
students and lasts only thirty minutes.  In fact, we
prefer complete informality on such occasions.

   Dr. Davidson's arrangements with you include a
renumeration of one hundred dollars for your services.
The usual letter of appointment from the Chancellor's
office will be sent to you in due course.  Dr. Davidison
and I are looking forward with much anticipation to your
being with us.

Sincerely yours,

Alfred C. Nelson

Alfred C. Nelson,
Director.
