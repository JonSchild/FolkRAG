Dear Father:

I'm awfully sorry you missed the program. I think
you would have liked it.

The more you run down your book, the more sure I
feel it will turn out to be very fine. I think everybody
 tortures their souls to do good writing. I'm forwarding
your comments on C.B.S. publicity to my co-worker there
and I'm sure it will get results.

I am still trying to stay on vacation and do my
own work at home. Elisabeth and I had a wonderful two
day trip in a open boat on the Chesapeake, sleeping and
living in the rain.

Much love to you both.
