Gentlemen:
Some time ago, one of your agents, Mr. Alan Lomax,
purchased some equipment for a Presto Model D
Recorder.  He instructed us to send him a bill for
the merchandise, and he would send us a remittance.
However, to date, we have not heard from Mr. Lomax
or received a remittance.
As this account is considerably past due, we would
appreciated it immensely if you would check into 
this matter, and send us a remittance.  Enclosed
you will find a duplicate invoice.
Kindly let us hear from you regarding this matter.
Very truly yours,
METROPOLITAN SOUND COMPANY
