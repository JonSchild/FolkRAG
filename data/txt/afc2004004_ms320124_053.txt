BARRY ANCELET   -52
ANCELET  I mean I didn't mean, I didn't
mean to horn in on your choreometrics thing.
LOMAX  No.  But I'll tell you. . .
ANCELET  But it's true.
LOMAX  Shall I tell you the, we have a 
scale. . . .[DIRECTIONS]
LOMAX  We have a scale in [UNCLEAR]
metrics, how much does the head move?  [UNCLEAR]. . . .and then
hitting the floor.  And in Africa you get maximum movement
in terms of actually rolling on the ground a lot of times,
all over the place.  And when I went to New Orleans I found
that ultimate, they'd not only roll on the ground and crawl
under the cars, sometimes people danced on the rooftops.  So
in America you go ever, you put it at the extreme.  So the
African went to the extreme.  They'd dance on the top of the
roof and crawl under the cars [INAUDIBLE].
ANCELET  Whereas here it's. . .
LOMAX  [CROSS TALKING]
ANCELET  . . .as smooth a plane as you can
keep it.
LOMAX  That's northern Europe.  And then
in middle Europe they, they do that skipping step, you know.
And they, they get about this much all the way through.  So
you never escape the [choreometric].
