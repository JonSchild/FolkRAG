John A. Lomax, Esq.
University Station
Austin, Texas.

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have a note from Mr. Garwick dated March
21 enclosing an invoice for $70.11 covering
charges made between December 11 of last year
and February 19 of this year. I am forwarding
this invoice to you with the request that you
will please check it and O.K. it, if it is to
be paid out of Library funds, or that you will
give it your early attention if it is to be
paid directly to you.

I should appreciate it if you will send to
me any bills received by you but to be paid by
the Library, so that these matters can receive
our prompt attention.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
