In a conversation the other day with a friend of mine in 
British Information,  I discovered that one very important 
foundation executive is convinced that there is no anti-British 
feeling in this country on the upper levels, for 
instance, in the colleges. If you have any evidence on 
this, it would be very useful to us in our college contacts.
