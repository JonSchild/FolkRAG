In the Davy Crockett almanacs there is a story about a 
fiddling minister who was on his way across country in a 
buggy. Somewhere in the Arkansas wilderness he got mixed up
in a swiftly running stream. He was miles from any house - 
he couldn't swim, so pulled out his fiddle and began to play.
Presently, a horseman came riding up, tied his rope to the
buggy wheel and hauled the conveyance to shore. The rescuer
was Davy Crockett, and he was curious as always. He asked the
minister why He's played the fiddle and the minister replied - 
"I could have called for help until I was hoarse and no one
would have noticed, but I know that if I began sawin' on my 
fiddle, if there was a frontiersman within ten miles, he'd
come runnin'. This is, and has been the power of the fiddle
in the American frontier - the fiddle held against the chest
and turned in ways to concert violinist does not understand.
Here is a typical country fiddle band. The Mainer Mountaineers.
