Lomax: Yes.
Cox: That's er. . .I don't know what war. They used to press people
away years gone by, hundreds o' years ago, I have been told.
Lomax: We don't have that, we never did have that in America; what
exactly was that anyway?
Cox: Er. . .The Pressgang; they used to have people what were well
off, you see, they'd press you away. They'd come an' take you.
Like the back street in Dundee. The press gang came to William,
he was all alone. He boldy fought for liberty an' there was six
to one. Blood did flow in torrents. "Pray kill me now, " says he,
"I would rather die for Mary on the banks of sweet Dundee."
They come an' they - they'd come an' take them away, force them
away, rather than have 'em fall in love with servant people.
Press you away; they didn't care what become of you. I don' know
about what wars they wor.
Lomax: I mean, whether you wanted to go or not they'd take you?
You wouldn't volunteer for the army or anything; they'd just take
you on anyway, uh?
Cox: They used to go an' take on. . .they'd press you, they'd press
you away on this - on this footin', round               there. Press
you away. What they called the press gang used to come an' take
'em. An' I think - I've heard my mother talk about - they did do
that. That sort o' died out right - when she was right young.
They'd press you away into the war, you see; come an' take you if
they wanted to. What they called pressin' on you. Come an' take
who they liked.
