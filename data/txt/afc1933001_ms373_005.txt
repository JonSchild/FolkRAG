Fox:   Mr. Lomax?

Lomax:   Yes.

Fox:   This is Oscar Fox.  Listen, I'm being sued for half a million
bucks for having used Home on the Range - what can I do?
Being sued for plagiarism would ruin me, completely.  What can
I do?

Lomax:   Pay it.

Fox:   What I've got over a meal ticket wouldn't

Lomax:   Then what've you got to lose.  Calm down.  This call isn't
reverse charges, is it?

Fox:   No, but Lomax, where did you get that song?  What sang it first?
Where'd it come from?  You have to help me out.  My publisher's
being sued too.  Where did you get that song?

Lomax:   That's what I'm telling these gentlemen now.  You're not the
only one in a mess.  I'll do what I can.

Fox:   Thanks, good bye.

Lomax:   Good bye - you see, I first got the song in Texas - in a
small town bar, about 1910, an old negro bar keep was singing

Song by negro voice -

Applause -

Voices -

Lomax:   Say, that's a might fine song you sung there - where'd you get it?

Negro:   Who are you, cap'n?
