My dear Miss Prink:

Thank you for your note of the 6th,
answering my question about Mr. Lomax's
address.

Since writing to you I have received
several communications from Mr. Lomax,
who has now returned to Austin. His present
address is University Station, as before.

Yours very sincerely,

Chief, Division of Music.
