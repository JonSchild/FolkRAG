There ain't nothing about a tractor that makes a man want to 
sing.  The thing keeps so much noise, and you so far away from 
the other folks.  There ain't a thing to do but sit up there and 
drive. 27.

Mechanization means the end of gang work, but there is a further 
effect.  It changes the content of songs as shown in the following:

Friend, I'm married unto Jesus
And we's never have been apart
I have a telephone in my bosom
I can ring him up from my heart
I can get him on the air (radio)
Down on my knees in prayer
I don't know what I'd do without 
the Lord. 28.

Then, too, the relations of people are becoming less intimate and 
personal than formerly.  The people are, as one informant says, "less 
sociable like"; with this change the original and spontaneous expressions 
are no longer transmitted as adequately as in the past.

Well there ain't much I can be telling you 'bout no songs 
and stories, but I can tell you this.  When I was coming up 
people show did sing more than they does now.  Folks was just 
more sociable like then, than they is now.  There has been 
times when us kids used to get together all in the house, boys 
and gals, and we'd see which one of us could tell the biggest 
story.  All of us just studying and thinking whilst we sitting 
there, lying, and singing, and telling them old riddles.  But 
now these kids round here don't do nothing like that.  Most of 
them go in the shows and around in town there in Clarksdale.  
Old folks do 'bout the same thing too, cause most of the time, 
that's what I does. 29.

One of the consequences of the city life is the decline of the 
customary controls on the one hand and the increase in the authority of 
the sheriff on the other hand.  This secular authority is incorporated
