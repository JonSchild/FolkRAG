MICHIGAN
-22-
At 8:00 A.M. we put on a light pack and
started walking to the mountains. The light pack is not
to be confused with a heavy pack. The light pack includes
a gun, bayonet, canteen, mess kit, coat, cartridge belt,
first aid kit, pup tent, stakes, tent pole, rope and a few other
negligible items. The heavy pack has a blanket or two in
it. Carrying my pack, I weight 237 pounds. I weighed 160 
pounds when I left so you can see how easy and agreeable it
is to romp and play in the mountains.
An observation car follows us as we climb the
mountains and picks up the fellows who faint. The boys who
fall out in the mountains are treated well. They are given
six months in the guard house, but they do not have to face
court martial.
At 12:00 noon, those who can, limp to the infirmary.
At the infirmary patients are divided into two classes - those
who have athlete's food and those who have colds. If you have
a cold you get your throat swabbed with iodine, and if you
have athlete's foot you get your feet swabbed with iodine. Any
one who claims he has neither a cold nor athlete's foot is sent
to the guard house for impersonating an officer.
I am very popular at the infirmary. I told them that
I have both a cold and athlete's foot. What I really have is gastric
ulcers but I know when to keep my mouth shut.
Well, that's all I have time to write tonight. I've 
got to rush to the mess hall. We're having hominy tonight. Oh boy!
