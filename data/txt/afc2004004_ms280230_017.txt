Never Wed an Auld Man.
1) For an auld man come courtin' me,
Hi-doo-a-darritee,
For an auld man come courtin' me,
Hi-doo-a-day,
For an auld man come courtin' me,
Hi-doo-a-darrittee,
Maids when you're young never wed an auld man.

2) When we went to the church
I left him in the lurch,
When we went to the church,
Me being young,
When we went to the church
I left him in the lurch.
Maids when you're young never wed an auld man.

3) When we went to our tea
He started teasin' me,
When we went to our tea,
Me bein' young.
When we went to our tea
He started teasin' me,
Maids when you're young never wed an old man.

4) When we went to our bed
He lay as he were dead,
When we went to our bed,
Me bein' young,
When we went to our bed
He lay as he were dead,
Maids when you're young never wed an auld man.
