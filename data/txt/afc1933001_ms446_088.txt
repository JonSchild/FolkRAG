Well, I'm resolved to see the Lord ! 
Perhaps he may his aid afford--
Come help me mourn my wretched case, 
My soul is lost without free grace !

Young people all, in blooming days, 
Hear what your Lord and Savior says ; 
Now is the time to seek my face, 
And to receive my Gospel-grace. 

With Gospel banner now he stands, 
With peace and pardon in his hands, 
Offering to sinners in their prime, 
Come, now is the accepted time. 

Come you that mourn, lament and weep, 
Who long to be among my sheep, 
'Tis my delight to set you free,
From sin, and death, and misery. 

Poor, broken hearts, why do you mourn, 
Like to some lonesome dove forlorn ? 
I am your Savior, come, rejoice, 
I bear your sins upon the cross. 

Forsake this world and all its fame,
Take up your cross, despise the shame, 
And now pursue the living way, 
That leads to everlasting day.

A little child was dying
And called its father near, 
And on his arms relying, 
She whispered in his ear-- 

Chorus--I am going home to glory,
A golden crown to wear, 
O, meet me, meet me, 
O, meet me over there !
