The musicians played out in the
yard under the trees, seemed to
be entirely motivated and dominated
by Hemphill.  He represents
the music of the old days -
fiddle tunes,  old blues,  the
ballads. - may be made the Boll
Weevil himself, but his version seems
pretty poor.
Recorded him [until] from 3 to
9.  Perishing of asthma - the dust
and heat & fatigue finally got me.
Started to Nashville.  To Clarksdale
to get a check cashed.  Then to Memphis
with a puncture.  Lewis Jones drove.
Slept 2 hours on the side of the 
road.  Drove into Nashville at noon
Sunday.  Spent the succeeding days
fruitlessly - seeing Jackson , sleeping,
recuperating from cold, visited
a poor session of the Church of
God.
