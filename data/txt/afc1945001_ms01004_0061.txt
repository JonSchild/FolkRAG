Since rumor is a much more intimate part of a 
person['s] [repertory of] than is his newspaper or [even] his
favorite commentator, it is likely that he places [more] a
different worth upon it.  This inclination will [&] vary with
the source of rumor and its content, probably.  It is
important to try to estimate people's belief in rumor.
This might best be done in connection with indirect
approach, but only if comparable material on other media is available.
For the development of an informational program, it is 
important to know relationship between authoritative
information given and nature of popular accounts.  While
we might want to keep track of all rumors, [for pr] this
would require a special program of collection and analysis.
For a first study it is suggested that we confine our
interest to two fields of rumor -- one where authoritative
information [has] is readily available, one where such
information is lacking.
Select 2 fields of information (called M and O)
     Rationing of sugar and of gas
     Requisitioning of cars and of radios
     Relative merits of Italian and German soldiers
     Relative merits of American & Japanese planes
Collect rumors by direct & indirect methods
Analyze nature and spread of rumors
compare results for rumors when there is little and much info.
Analyze: absolute number of reports for M and O 
                percentage of reports [asking] citing authority, for M & O
                content -qualitative analysis for rumor families designated as contributing to
                or impeding war effort [?] -greatest for M & O
                accuracy of M & O - newspapers, radio prior to & during study.
