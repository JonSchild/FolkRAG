August 22, 1934
Mr. John A. Lomax
University Station
Austin, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
Returning from a week’s holiday in New Haven, I find my last
letter to you (July 26) returned as “unclaimed” from Austin - 
apparently after having been forwarded to Albuquerque.  This letter
I have just sent back to Austin, not knowing where else to reach
you and trusting that by this time you will have either returned
there or sent in a forwarding address.  I may as well repeat here,
however, what I wrote last month:  Mr. Ashley authorizes me to say
that the Library will be glad to arrange for the printing and distribution 
of your circular letter to prison officials (the material
collected to come eventually to us) and asks you to supply copy and
mailing list.
In the meantime, both Mr. Engel and Mr. Ashley remind me that no
report for the fiscal year 1933/34 has as yet been received from you.
Mr. Engle is anxious, of course, to include an account of your
activities in his report to the Librarian, already submitted, and will
appreciate your sending me something for this purpose.  The Librarian’s
report is due at the Printing Office before long.  I enclose a reprint
from last year’s report, in case you have none handy, and shall ask
you to let me have copy by the end of the month if you can possibly
do so.
With regards to you and to Alan from Mrs. Strunk and myself.
Cordially,
Chief
Division of Music
