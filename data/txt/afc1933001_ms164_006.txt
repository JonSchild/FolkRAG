WALKIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT

As sung by Edna Faber, Negro sharecropper's wife in East Ar-
kansas, to Lee Hays, 327 West 25th St., N. Y. C. Apt. B1.

Went awalkin' in the moonlight,
Happy as could be,
Had the purtiest little woman
You never did see.

Walked into the East,
And walked into the West
Stayed away from the South,
No better than the rest.

Boss mas come a runnin',
Said, 'Jim, you come with me;
Got forty-four acres of cotton,
You never did see.

Boss man, I am busy,
I'm afixin' to be wed,
I don't want to chop no cotton,
So far away from home.

He putt out a forty-four pistol,
Said, 'Jim, you come with me;
Or I'll blow your brains to pieces,
And hang you on a tree.

My party little woman,
Set down and start to cry,
I told her honey baby
I got to say goodbye.

Boss man come and got me
He's got a forty-four,
I'm goin' to chop some cotton
Just on the other shore.

When I get through choppin' cotton,
Then to you I'll run,
But we never will get married,
This side of 'Kingdom Come'.
