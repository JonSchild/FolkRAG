2. Benson, La., August 6, 1942.

            In my  presence some men were joking with a Negro young man about his being 
"fit to fight."  When he  left, a soldier said to me: "That is a touchy subject 
around here.  The fact that so many of the Negro boys are being sent back while 
the white boys are being accepted is making the community pretty apprehensive 
over leaving most of the colored boys here with white women while most of the 
white boys are being taken."  [*79*]
