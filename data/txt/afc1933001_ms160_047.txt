Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax

Thank you for returning the galley proof of your article
so promptly. We were able to make almost all of the changes you
suggested before returning the final pages to the printer. 

Attached is a schedule of rates for reprints and you
will see from it that we cannot order less than 50 copies.
The article runs 4 pages and there will probably be no additional
charge (except for postage) unless you want a cover. 

Since we do not hold type very long on the Bulletin, I
will be glad to hear from you promptly if you wish us to place
an order for the reprints.

Sincerely yours
Beatrice Sawyer Roswell
