AL:   We're gonna now hear the song that Linda stood on the 
chair to sing when she was 5.

Man:   And how old were you -- 5. . . 4 or 5?

Linda:   Probably that old.

Man:   When she learned to play the guitar. . .in her daddy's car.

Linda:   I hid.

Man:   hid in the car.   And can you imagine anybody that can play
the guitar any better than she can?   And when we started, she
wouldn't touch that guitar, and I gave that guitar to her and
said, if you don't play, I won't sing -- so that was the way we
started.   Here is the song that she sung when she was about
5 years old, and we did it without any music . . . .

Linda:   We might be able to do it. . 

Man:   Alright, let's do it.

Linda (sings):    "Away by the water so clear/The ladies were winding
their way/  When Pharoah's little daughter stepped down in the
water to bake(?) in the cool of the day.   (Together):  Before
it was dark/She opened the ark/ and found a sweet infant was
there."

Man:   We'll sing you one more verse.

Linda (sings):    "Away by the water. . . . . ."

Man:   If I could sing a little (unint.) you ought to be ashamed
of yourself.  This lady sitting here, she's the oldest daughter,
she started also when she was--how old-- 4, 5, 6, . . .
