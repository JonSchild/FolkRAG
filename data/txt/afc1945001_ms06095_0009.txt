Columbia, South Carolina
August 3, 1942
(1) Several people in the course of the day in Columbia repeated
substantially this story with slight variations: Enemy submarines have
been refueling on the coast of South Carolina in and around Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina. They have refueled in one instance, according to the
story, in a public garden preserve near Myrtle Beach and in several other
instances at isolated spots near Myrtle Beach; that there is no excuse for
gasoline rationing in South Carolina, which has a number of pipe lines and
refineries, except as a means of checking up on the delivery of gasoline to
these submarines for refueling purposes. [*33*]
