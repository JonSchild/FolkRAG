So she dressed herself up, went so rare an' complete,
For she was determined her Willie to meet.
She had pumps on her feet an' a cane in her hand,
And she met her dearest Willie as she walked down the Strand.

"Oh Willie, Oh Willie, from this place you must flee,
For my father is intending your butcher to be.
Go quickly to Dover, I will have you go there,
In less than eight and forty hours I will meet you there."

Then up spoke this pretty maid with a tear in her eye,
Sayin', "I will have you, or else I will die."
Straightway then she gave him two handfuls of gold
And walked along down the Strand like some young sailor bold.

As this pretty fair maid walked along down the Strand,
She met her own father, sayin', "You are that man,"
A sword from his side he then instantly drew,
And into her body he pierced it quite through.

Soon as this old miser saw what he had done,
He tore off his hair an' his fingers he wrung. 
Sayin', "Wretched cruel monster, what have I now done?
I have killed my only daughter, she's the flower of London."

And then this old miser, he took it so hard,
He leaned on his sword till it pierced through his heart.
"Forgive me," he cried, as he drew his last breath,
An' then closed his eyes in the cold hands of death.

Soon as this young sailor heard of this affair,
He came quickly to Dover an' died in despair.
There was father an' daughter an' this young sailor bold,
All died an untimely death for the sake of bright gold,
