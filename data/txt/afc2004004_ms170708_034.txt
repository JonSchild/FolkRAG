one word or tow in it in my mind. I don't know what that should be.
Kennedy: Well, sing us one verse. I'd like to hear how your tune goes.
Cox: That, er. . . .(pause)
As I walked out one midsummer's mornin'. . .
As I walked out on midsummer's morning,
To view the field an' to take the air,
Down by the banks of the sweet primroses
There I beheld a most lovely fair.
Kennedy: "I said, Fair maid. . ."
Cox: Yeah, that's how it go on. "What is the cuase of all your grief."
You know it. What's the use o' me tellin' you anything. You know more
that I do.
Kennedy: No I don't Harry. (laughs)
Cox: No. I keep talkin' about things an' then. . . .
D. Kennedy: It's funny how it keeps coming back to you. A little bit
sort of brings back another.
Cox: (laughs) Yeah. (pause)
Kennedy: I might know little bits of things, but I don't know them
through like you do.
Cox: I, er. . .(pause) I know so many different things. I - I forgot
what I do know really. You never did know the Old Dolphin. That's a 
song my father used to sing.
Kennedy: The Old Dolphin?
Cox: Aye. The old Dolphin. "We had not been a-sailing. . ." (pause)
"just twenty leagues or more. . . " You never did. . .They used to sing
that at the pub. (laughs) I know a bit o' it; a fightin' sort o'
song, you know. (pause) You want to just hear a little bit o' it?
(laughs)
