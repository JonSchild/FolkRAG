BJ TAPE 2, p. 18
BJ: (Cont.) 'jus one bone, an' then, an' so, and she pulled from
his side to to be side of 'im and not ahead of 'im, and not the 
lead of 'im. An' then, other words, he was there firs'.
AL: Did you ever hear that story about how God distributed the
powers between men and women?
BJ: Hum-im.
AL: That old folks' story?
BJ: No. How it go? I'd like to hear it.
AL: Well, it says, ah...
BJ: The Bible says it call for the cunning women. There's som
cunning womens, ya know. An' it's very cunning, ya know. Some
is cunning in the Church, how they do the things. Some is cunning
in this field of plays, jus' like myself, ya know. And,
and diffrunt things. Cunning in diffrunt ways, cunning with
righteousness ya know. And some can go in the
streets an' stand there and beg all day long, an' sell. You know,
you know, diffrunt things, like that. It's cunning. They know
how they look on you -- look, like my daughter-in-law look like
she can jes', jes', jes' pick your money out your pocket when
sellin' candies an' sellin' diffrunt things. But me, I cain't
do that, see. The minute you say, you say you don't want it, I'm
through. That ain't my part, see. I cain't sell; I just cain't. 
Goin' 'round sellin' somethin'. knockin' on doors, ha! I cain't,
but that;s not my, not my field, see. Some of everything. An', an' ah...
So I begin to pray over it and to worry over it, an' so one night
I was readin' the Bible about the women that loved chirrun,
you know. I love chirrun an' ol' people best; that's my love.
An' I found out an' I read in the Bible, it says, they are called
a tottler. So that's what I'm called.
