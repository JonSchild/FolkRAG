RUMORS. August 10 - 15, 1942
PRODUCTION OF WAR MATERIALS. LABOR RELATIONS. (Cont.)

A girl, inspector in local aircraft plant, reports "Funny things are
happening. They used to tell us to speed up our production. Now they tell
us to slow down. They say material is running out and the job won't last."
This ties in with a newspaper story of deliberate slowdown in Muskegon.
"Production of war materials is purposely being held up in factories
by the unions, who keep a close supervision over the non-union workers to see
that their work is regulated to the speed set by the unions."
"Work in war plants is being deliberately slowed down by union leaders, 
who are still acting on the 'Make the work last' principle."
"They are cancelling our vacations in the factory but we would do lots
better work if we could get a little rest."

RATIONING. SHORTAGES. CONFISCATION.

"After the election the government is going to take over all privately
owned automobiles. Why, with the thousands of good cars rotting in used car
lots?"
"Workmen in a factory (not named) were warned that all automobiles,
refrigerators, and electrical equipment would have to be turned in to the
government soon."
"They say there is so much sugar in the country they are at their wit's
end to know what to do with it - they're even plowing sugar cane under. I don't
see why in the world we shouldn't have all the beet sugar we want, anyway."
"All the passenger boats on the Great Lakes were to be taken out of
service and turned over to the government for military use." (Mackinac boat)
"My grocery man tells me that soon the middle west will get no fruit
(especially oranges) because of lack of transportation. This will cause ill
health."
"After the war is over there will be no tea, coffee, spices, etc. for
many years. Better hoard some. People are already drying mint for tea."
(Greyhound bus)
"Practically everything will be rationed after the election."
"Gas rationing in the East is not enforced. Gas station operators
sell gasoline without even looking at the ration books."
"The government is making electric light bulbs for defense industries
only and soon we won't be able to secure any for home use."
" We would be rationed next for gasoline and before Labor Day."
"Clothes will be rationed by fall."
"Gas is to be rationed without warning on Saturday, August 15th."
"When the staff of Selfridge Field is doubled, the army will take over
Detroit apartment houses for the families of their staff, forcing those Detroit
citizens not in defense work to double up, or leave the city." (Birmingham, Michigan)
"When the government confiscates automobiles they will give the owners the
choice of taking money or war bonds in payment. If the choice is war bonds, a
priority number will also be issued so that after the war the new cars will be
available not to the person willing to pay a high price but in priority number order."
"There is no shortage of paper and no need to save it as I have called the
scrap collection office three times and they do not come for my paper. I saw a
Salvation Army truck in the next block and asked the driver to pick it up and he 
refused."
