Chicanos, the Mexican used, because they're. . .
AL  Anyway, they used it.
     :  They, they used, they used the button
accordian which is [titanic] tuned.  And then it found its
way into southwest Louisiana.  But it is believed that the
black people used this, this instrument before the white
people did. And if finally found its way into, and it
became the dom, the, the dominant instrument in the, in the
Cajun group.  The, the way, the reason it got so popular
back in those days there was no amplification.  So the
accordian is so much louder than a fiddle and triangle and
so forth, that, and it also has bases on it, and it became
so well learned that the people talked most about the
accordian.  And the most talked about is the most popular.
AL  Well this teaching that you're doing
is, is really a long dream of yours, isn't it?
