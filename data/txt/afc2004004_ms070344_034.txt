air, the men with their collars up - 
a ghostly, dreamlike silent crowd
of perhaps five hundred pouring into 
the gateway all at once, filling the 
courtyard before the church and
disappearing into the great now
grey & shadowy doorway.  Meantime
the bells were tolling & at the last
peal the street & the court were empty.
I turned from this dreamlike vision
and asked Mr. Connor who was filling
my pump.

A funeral, he said.
A funeral?  But so many
people.

Ah, he said,  Nearly everyone know
everyone else hereabouts and we all
turn out when one of the good neighbors
goes.

And then on down the road, dark &
rainy to Limerick, where Jim Mahan
waited with his double purposes, his
ill will & friendliness & my repaired
recording machine.
