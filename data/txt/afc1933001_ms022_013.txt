Letter dated Nov. 12 from
Mr. John A. Lomax.
In a letter dated November 13, 1934, Mr. Lomax writes:
"Please have Mr. Putnam write and send to me a letter of introduction to Mrs. Edouard May, New Orleans, La., giving me such character as might impress a most exclusive aristocrat. She knows a group of rare Creole folk-songs, unpublished and very interesting which I wish to record. Some friendly exaggeration of the importance of my enterprise and of my primary in the field may give me a hearing unavailable through other means. Send the letter to me here, *though I hit the trail tomorrow or the day thereafter."
