Dear Dr. Spivacke,

In response to your request for explanation
of my presence in my office on April 3 and April 8:-
I was engaged in work on "Wellsprings of Music,"
Columbia's program for schools , sponsored by the
Library of Congress. I try to do  most of my work
on this program outside regular office hours. I do
feel, however, that I can legitimately request an
all-hour pass. My work at the Archive requires
more time than the amount required by law. I also
have work to do as Fellow of the Radio Project. Then
there are constant calls upon me for special jobs,
concerts, lectures, demonstrations, bibliographies, 
which require late work in my office near my files and
my reference books. May I therefore urge you
strongly to issue me an all-hour pass.
