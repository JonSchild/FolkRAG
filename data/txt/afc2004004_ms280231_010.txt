"And the little girls used this song for almost any counting game. . . 

A-tisket, a-tasket, 
A little yellow basket, 
I wrote a little letter to my love and on the way I dropped it. 

A-tisket, a-tasket, 
A little yellow basket, 
One of you has picked it up and put it in your pocket. 
It wasn't you, it wasn't you, it wasn't you - it was YOU ! 

"We also had a number of hymns, the most popular of which was 
a song the children mostly learnt from the Salvation Army. . . . 

We're fucking well sure, 
We're off for a trip on the hallelujah ship 
And we're never coming back any more. 

"And of course, there were numerous rhymes. . . 

A boy stood on the burning deck, 
Selling peas a penny a peck. 
Did he wash his dirty neck ? 
No ! [0]- Did he heck !

Hamish McColl sings: 

O dear what can the matter be 
Two old ladies got locked in the lavatory, 
They were there from Monday till Saturday, 
Nobody knew they were there. 

One, two, three, four five, 
Once I caught a fish alive. 
6.7.8.9.10 
Then I let it go again. 

Why did you let it go, 
Because it bit my finger so. 
Which finger did it bite ? 
This little finger on my right.
