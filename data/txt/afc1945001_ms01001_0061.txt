Random listening, casual exploring on the dial until one hears something
interesting, makes radio inappropriate in this type of work.  Similarly,
street corner speeches would be inappropriate, though they might be useful
for other campaigns.

The direct counteraction program should be used to eliminate some
few specific rumors but more important is its contribution to the educational
campaign designed to develop sound thinking habits in the community. 
Some rumors are natural and unavoidable.  They may be analyzed publicly to
help people understand that rumors are natural.  It should not be too difficult
to help the community at large to working comprehension of the
psychological laws which govern the development of rumors.  This approach
would help ease some of the basic anxieties and encourage inter in the 
processes involved.

Special campaigns should not be directed against any particular
rumor, except in very rare cases.  Sometimes a particular rumor causes
serious trouble in and of itself, but this is so rare an occurrence that
we may safely assume that most projects dealing with rumors will never have
to consider this.  Campaigns should be stimulated and guided by the study
of rumors to eliminate the ignorance that begets the untrue tale.

V.  Education Program--On Rumors in Wartime.
Key people in the rumor-combating project can be expected to be
called upon for public talks or special publicity concerning their work.
It is important that such talks and publicity be integrated into the total
educational program.  To present a round of talks on "Rumor" may prove
much less efficient than to devote the same amount of time and energy to
talks supplying basic information which will help eliminate the more
pernicious rumors.
