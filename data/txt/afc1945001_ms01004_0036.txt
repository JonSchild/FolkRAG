Dear Ira:

In view of the differences in the information which your interviewers have, even your definition  will not permit us to estimate what percentage of rumors available are true and what are false.  What we probably shall have to do is retain a major emphasis on analysis of the materials agreed upon as being outside of the realm of standard information as recorded by Media and Sources.  By leaving the conception of rumor open we have exposed ourselves to many difficulties as you have recognized, but it seems more important to get something that will work, and Allport assured us that it would work.  Anyway, thanks loads.

Cordially yours,

Eugene L. Horowitz
