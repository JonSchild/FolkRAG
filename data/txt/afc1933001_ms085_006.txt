"Ah got a heart lak a rock ca-ast in-nto th' sea..." Beale
Street Bessie would moan, while her audience rocked in slow rhythm
to her voice.

Bessie Smith, who in 1917 jumped from the Beale Street
Palace Theater in Memphis to the bright lights of New York to become
known as the best of the "coon shouters," was killed last night in 
an automobile accident near Vicksburg, Mississippi

Bessie, 190-pound favorite of negroes everywhere, had come 
thru Memphis only two weeks ago with a tent show - and had planned 
then to revive her old show and present it at the Palace.

Tho she was 50, and it had been some time since the public 
clamored for phonograph records of her husky voice, Bessie sang last 
year at the Cotton Club in New York.

Beale Street mourned today the death of Bessie Smith, the 
"queen" of blues singers.

In 1917, Bessie sang the blues in her inimitable manner in 
a Beale Street theater, attracted the attention of Eastern theatrical
agents and soon was famous.

Broadway welcomed her and the bright lights of other cities
added to her glory.  She made many phonograph recordings and negroes
everywhere knew Bessie.

Two weeks ago she returned to Memphis to join the "Broadway 
Rastus" show on Beale Street.  Last night the troupe headed for 
Vicksburg, Miss.  Early today the car in which she was riding overturned, 
killing the 50-year-old singer.
