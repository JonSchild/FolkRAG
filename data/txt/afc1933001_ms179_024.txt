above subject and then drop me a line about it, I'd
be very grateful for your trouble.  You can tell Jerry that
I haven't so much as seen a 9A pick-up since I spoke
to [Jer] last.

   I still have hopes that you'll drop in and listen
to some of the old race records we have here from way
back.

I hope to see you soon

Sincerely yours,

Arthur Becker
