     "I went to the beauty parlor Saturday and the operator had had a bunch of
WAAC's and are they sore? They said they came in here to have office jobs, to sit
behind fancy big desks and get commissions and here they are drilling until they're
sick, sitting around on the floor like a bunch of hogs, and when they go to the
doctor's, there are somany there that there aren't enough chairs in the sitting
room for them while they wait. One said she left a good job to take this training
and if she had know what it was going to be she sure wouldn't have come. They
beauty operator said they will have commissions some time and they said: 'Yeah,
when they want someone to do some dirty work behind the front lines over there."
