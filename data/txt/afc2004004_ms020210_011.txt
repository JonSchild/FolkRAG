Dear Beulah Wing:
Thank you for your letter of December 28th.  I do appreciate your
decision to agree with us that Peter ought to get royalties for
the film.  On my part I will suggest to Mable and Peter, and to
Bessie Jones, they should make a contribution to pay John's
doctor bill out of the royalties when they come.
I, myself, will be glad to contribute $25.00.  My check is enclosed.
Warm regards,
Sincerely,
Alan Lomax
