12B English male Negro

I have heard "That the war would 
be over by 1944, that selective service 
boards are not turning down 
anyone of age unless they have
 only one arm or leg or cannot see, 
that meat and clothing would be 
rationed by april first, that the Germans 
are sinking all of our supply ships
 in the atlantic.
