Lomax: But you - all had never made love or anything till you were
married, had you?
Jean: Oh no, nothing out of place, - except for an innocent kiss
or two - but nothing else. Nothing at all wrong.
Lomax: You wouldn't permit it at all.
Jean: He never tried - and I would never let him anyway. If he 
had tried that would have been him finished. No - he didn't try
Oh no. We courted, but we didn't lose our heads.
Lomax: Were you happy with him from the very beginning?
Jean: oh yes. I've stuck to him through thick and thin anyway, and 
I've got a lot of trouble.
Lomax: What I mean, was - being married and being close to a man
difficult for you or was it easy. Did it take some getting used to?
Jean: To a man? Oh well, I suppose it comes natural to anybody.
That certain age when we married -- we just loved natural, and poor
and humble. But still - we never wanted. We both had to work very
hard for a living. Then we began to have a family. What could you
expect? A family right away.
Lomax: Where did you actually start to live?
Jean: We just lived in Aberdeen. Got a house in Aberdeen.
Lomax: Then you went out in the summer?
Jean: We didna really go out after we was married, for nine years.
We gave up our life of going out in the summer both me and him. We
had our chuldren little. It was nine years before we went out.
Lomax: And you both worked as canvassers?
Jean: Yes, we both canvassed.
Lomax: Buying second-hand things?
Jean: We did everything. We brought stuff and we sold stuff. We
made a livelihood.
Lomax: Going round with a handcart and picking things up. Was that
the way you didit?
Jean: No - I sell goods and tuff of every kind, and he did the same.
By people watched it yonder, and sometimes through the day, too.
Lomax: Sometimes they didn't get watched?
Jean: Oh no. That was one thing -- I would never leave my
children. Never!
