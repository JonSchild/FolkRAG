TAPE 30. MRS ELIZABETH CRONIN:
Shule Agrah:  Music
1) I would I were on yonder hill,
And there I'd sit and cry my fill,
And every tear would turn a mill,
(Gaelic line)
Chorus: also in Gaelic.
2) I'll sell my rock, I'll sell my reel,
I'll sell my only spinning wheel,
To bring my love a coat of steel.
3) I'll dye my petticoats, I'll due them red,
And on the world I'll beg for bread,
Until my parents wish me dead.

Uncle Rat:  Music
1) Uncle Rat went out to ride,
Kitty Alone, Kitty Alone,
Uncle Rat went out to ride,
Kitty Alone and I am.
Uncle Rat went out to ride,
Sword and buckler by his side,
To me cax-me-carey-diffin-i-dill,
Kitty alone and I am.
2) Lady Mouse will you marry me?
Ask my Uncle Rat, said she.
3) Uncle Rat, will I marry lady Mouse?
Yes, kind sir, and half my house.
4) Lady Mouse, where will the wedding be,
Ask my Uncle Rat said she.
5) Uncle Rat, where will the wedding be?
Up on the  top of a holow tree.
Lomax: O that's the nicest song I've heard for a long time. Where 
did you learn that, MrsCronin?
Cronin: O glory be to God, I could never tell you. I heard it when
I was very young.
Lomax: Was it sung to you when you were a young child?
Cronin: Yes. So many people called and came and stayed and went
on that you know, you should have something always from someone.
