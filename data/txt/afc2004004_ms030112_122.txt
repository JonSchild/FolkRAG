MRS. DAVIS:
Well I'd go to say Delacorts I'd just serve, I didn't cook there, somebody come in and do the cooking.
LARRY:
Well they missed out they should of had your cooking.
MRS. DAVIS:
Are we starting up there.
LARRY:
No, we're already on. What did you think about when Rev. Davis went to England when he first got to go to England?
MRS. DAVIS:
Well, I thought it was real fine for him to go and I think he was gone three weeks and of course he had somebody, there was a girl down there to carry him around from place to place in a car and it was wonderful.
LARRY:
He enjoyed it too.
MRS. DAVIS:
Oh yes he did, but he said he was so tired how every night he would go to a different place it wasn't the same you know Larry.
LARRY:
Oh yes I was over there.
MRS. DAVIS:
That tires you out and him being a much older person than you, you know how it served him.
