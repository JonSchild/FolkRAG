**Lewis.Great record of great music.
- 80th psalm, 5th verse. Stornaway tune.
One of the most beautiful sounds I've 
ever heard.  Rising silver sheets of 
perfect unison. Like great grey 
rollers on a calm sea - a slow 
powerful wind behind a great golden 
vessel.  All from Lewis.

lovely leader, but singing not so 
beautiful.

folksy.
