Dr. Spivacke, Chief of Music

December 14, 1940

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

An order from Dr. Stith Thompson, Indiana University,
has been received for 49 records. I suggest that we take care
of it within the next four weeks since Dr. Thompson, through
whom it really comes is a person of so much importance to us
in the Archive of American Folk Song. HURRAH!

Sincerely,
Alan Lomax
