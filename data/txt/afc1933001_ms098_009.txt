Dear Mrs. Lomax:
                                 Your letter of February 22nd at hand. I am having your order for AAFS 16 and a 12- inch copy of the last part of "Chisholm Trail" filled by the Recording Laboratory, for mailing to Carl Sandburg. A statement will be sent to you separately. I enclose two copies of our catalog.

                                  I also enclose an envelope con-taining the name and address of Mirror Shadow- graphed needles. You should be able to buy these locally at a good record or radio transcription shop, or from the Dallas representative of the Mirror or Presto Recording Companies.

                                 My Oklahoma trip was very pleasant. I have also spent two weeks in New York putting the finishing touches to my book.

                                 Best wishes to you and Mr. Lomax and for the book.

                                     Faithfully,
