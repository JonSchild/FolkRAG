Dear Bess:
You have really been most patient and forebearing in the matter
of the notations of Bessie's musical transcriptions.  They have
been staring me in the face for months and only last night was I
able to sit down with Victor Grauer and give them a thorough
looking over.  First of all, he is most flattering about the job
you have done and the decisions you have arrived at.  He feels
quite sure that the situation you are coping with is, in its
general outlines, the one that Jones describes in his book on
African music.  It is in view of this that he has made a few 
suggestions about ways in which to handle the rhythm, which will
give the singer who wants to dig for it a sense of the really
swinging quality of the tunes.  In essence, he feels that, in
these songs as in much of African music, there is frequently 
a lag alternation between measures of straight /4 and irregular
measures.  You get two measures of 4/4,  one of 3/8, one of 5/8,
another two of 4/4, etc.  The ties, he suggests, should be
lightened in their effect so that the singer can find the tempo
one-footedly.  That is, instead of putting an 8th note before
the bar, you put a grace note and tie with a gliss sign.  Furthermore, 
you note the irregularity of the meter by using a 
dotted bar to divide the 3 from the 5.  In working this way, the
singer can disregard the dotted bar and the grace note if he
likes, or, if not, can develope his relationship to the 3 and 5
by counting slowly, still omitting the grace note; then, in the
final stage, put the grace note in.  On some pages, we put notes
about how this might be done.  It's not going to mean that what
you've done has to be redone really, but just slightly revised.

I am much taken with the effect that Victor gets with this approach 
to the rhythm, as it seems to me that it corresponds very
nicely to the feel of this music and to the heavy body accents
that Bessie and her folks put in.  So much for rhythm.

I think the way that you are handling the variant tunes really
can't be improved on.  You are presenting the reader with two
extremely nice melodies in every case, and melodies which have a 
really knit-together feeling.

About texts, it seem to me that your approach is correct.  I
would edit the texts so that [they] normal singers can handle them
with ease, as you apparently plan to do with "Chattanooga."

I have written to Harold Darling.

Please let me know exactly when the kids are coming to town.  I
have two telephone numbers --GR 7-4875 and WA 9-5292.  The
books sound wonderful and the possibility of your coming here for
a visit is just the greatest news ever.  The rest will be
settled in a telephone call I am about to make to you this 
evening.

Much love,
