Reel of 9/26/61, Side 1, Song 12 [*30*]

ELEPHANT FAIR
A play chant for a jump dance

I went down to the elephant fair,
And the birds and the bees were there,
And I went all around by the may post there
And he drug his snout on the ground.
Get the best, old lady,
He's the best, old man,
I love the black boy who totes the money,
Oh lady,
Oh man,
[There's the governor,]
In the gully
[He] can't stand.
Now you Alabama sucker, take your hands offa me,
Take your hands offa me.
You better not mess with Lulu,
I'll tell you the reason why
'Cause she'll cut out your heart with a razor
And cut out your insides, too...
(REPEAT LAST LINE FASTER EACH TIME UNTIL THE END)
