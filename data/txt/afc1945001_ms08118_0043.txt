Joke 

A few days ago an old hermit 
was found in the heat of a desert, 
he had participated in the last war 
and his relatives believed he had 
been killed in action.  Upon being 
enlightened upon the topic of "Der Fuehrer" 
and his followers, He was told 
that he should purchase stamps 
and bonds with the money he 
had been hoarding.  He then asked 
with a quizical look on his face 
if he was to put the stamps 
on envelopes.
