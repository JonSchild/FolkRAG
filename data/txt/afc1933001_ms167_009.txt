Dear Mrs. Maney:
I should be delighted to see the copies of the
four songs you mentioned, along with any others
that you remember hearing your parents sing.
The Frong song, "Brennan on the Moor" and "Gypsy
Davy" are all songs I should like to have and
"McAllister, McAllister" is completely new to me.
Please let me hear from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge of the
Archive of American Folk Song
