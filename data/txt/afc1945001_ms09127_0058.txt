In the fighting off Guadacanal the U. S. Marines
had a good laugh went they captured a General and his Aide 
As the prisoners were walking to the concentration camp the General 
took something out of his pocket, and started to talk to it 
as if it were as god. The Marines asked to see if, and were
they surprised to see the one and only, famous comiedian 
of the screen.  "Mickey Mouse."  A God of some sort to the
Japanese soldiers only.
