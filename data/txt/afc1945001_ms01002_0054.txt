NOTE * Some adaptation of diagrams
like the attached, with appropriate
instructions and with specific directions 
for operating Clincs would be part of 
a training manual -

and around the method set down in this
manual could be developed interesting,
instructive and effective Propaganda
Clincs to be held in every town and
city in the country.

The methods used in these Clincs would 
also be used in programs over the radio
and in newspapers - and adapted for use
in direct mail folders, billboards, etc.
