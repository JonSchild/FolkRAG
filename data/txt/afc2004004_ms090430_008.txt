          On February 28th, 1888, the Delta portion of Holmes 
County was added to the district.
          When the new County of Humphreys was formed 
embracing parts of Yazoo, Holmes and Washington counties, the 
district boundary was not changed, but, of course, a new board 
member was appointed to represent the new county.
          Through Section 25 of the Act creating the Levee 
Board, It was wisely provided that the Board of Levee Commissioners 
are authorized and empowered to treat, contract, 
and negotiate with the Mississippi River Commission, or with 
any other agency of the United States for the purpose of securing 
the construction, repair and maintenance of the levees of 
the Mississippi River front for the purpose of protecting the 
people of the Mississippi Delta from overflow.
           Under Section 232 of the Mississippi Constitution 
of 1890, it is expressly provided that the commissioners of 
our levee district and the Mississippi levee district shall have 
supervision over the erection, repair and maintenance of the 
levees in their respective districts and shall have full power 
to contract in any wise or cooperate in any manner with the 
Government of the United States.
          The wisdom of this constitutional provision is 
now manifest. Throughout the years the levee boards have 
constantly striven to awake the Congress of the United States 
to a sense of National responsibility for flood control. The 
groundwork laid bore fruit after the disastrous flood of 1927
