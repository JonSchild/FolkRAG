BJ  TAPE 2, p. 5

AL:  Was this a white man or a colored man?

BJ:  A white man, Mister [Toar] Todd (?).  An' he, he, he looked back     
 an' kep' right on walkin',

 there [ ] didn' pay me no mind, [ ] walked

right [ ] on --  Ain' nobody else pay me no mind; that's what hurt

me so bad.
   
 He, he! Nobody paid --  Oow, boy, I'll never forget that.

That, that jus' -- I felt cheaper than anybody who -- I coulda

jus', [I wished] I coulda just sunk through that floor an' went on to

Georgia.  Ha, ha, tha's the truth!  An' after that, that all

over, ya see.

AL: Where was this?

BJ:  That was, that was in Eastern Shore.  On Eastern Shore.

In Maryland, ya know.

    An' so, an' ah, that, that was a long time ago, years ago

back [in] there, when I first went up to [stay].  An' so I

got used to it after that.  Everything got jus' fine.

    Lawdamercy, I [jus'] declare... jus' plain on

I felt ashamed.  Nobody had done no explainin' or nothin'.

Jus', jus' folks jus' kept on... An' I was on the [ ] 'matoe line,

drivin' the [ ] 'matoe line, ya know, in the tomato line.  An'

that thing... An' it look like all the good works that they

could they do, they put me at it, ya know.  [Speakin'] You know that way,

ya know, an' jus callin' me... I said, "Man," I said, "I ain'

know nothin 'bout this 'lectricity thing here."

    [ ] Says, "See that?  Jus' [teach me to] touch so-and-

so."  Says, "You can do it."

    I says, "Sure, I can do it.  I can do it; if I do it I

fall out here an' dead and gone like that..."  First think I

know, I'm doin' it.
