Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

You have, I believe, heard form Miss Kemper and Paul
Glass of the New York City Music Project, of our deep 
desire to have you speak to the teachers of the Project
at their Institute which is held every Wednesday morning.

We regret so much that you cannot be with us this week,
for we are eager to have you tell us something of your
vast knowledge of American folklore and music.

Are you perhaps spending the holidays in New York City?
If so, could you arrange to remain over for the Institute
on January 3rd?  If that date is not feasible, will you
let me know when you will be available?   I realize that
I am being persistent, especially when we have no honorarium
to offer. However, I hope it will convey to you our eagerness
to have you with us.

Looking forward to hearing form you, and to meeting you
soon, I am,

Yours sincerely,
[*Frances McFarland*]
(Mrs.) Frances McFarland
Manager
Music Education Division
