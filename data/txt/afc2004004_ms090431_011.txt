Fisk, 6. 5. HAFFER. 

Eat your supper;
Curry your mule.
Go on, curry him, 
Curry him right.
He ain't on the payroll Saturday night.

A: What kind of a song would you call that?
H: Well, you see, that was a levee-camp song. I used to live close
to a levee-camp once; I wasn't far from it. 
A: What kind of [people] a place were in a levee-camp in the old days? a Nice [people] place to live [with]?
H : No sir, it wasn't. The people called levee-camp people dangerous
people. They thought that there was no good come out of the levee-
camp. Of course, now it's different, but in those days nobody didn't
particularly recognize levee-camp people.
A: What happened down there in the levee-camp that makes people think-
H : Well, they were gamblers, you know. In those days people didn't 
set up gambling -- now it ain't no harm, now it's all right -- but
in those day, if a girl was makin love to a man they thought that's
a terrible thing (laughter).
A: I guess a lot of em did though anyway?
H: Oh, yes, of course they did.
A: Were they pretty bad in shooting crap?
H : They did, yeah. They kill one another and things like that. 
Push em on little crap games. Push em on little crap games and
gamble. Men, you see, in those days nobody went out on the farm. You
see, the white people had then -- of course, they don't have that
now -- that you couldn't go on their place and all that kind of stuff. 
They'd get these people out of what they done and since you don't
bother the white men, you can do most anything you wanted to do.
You're a good worker, ain't nobody gonna bother you. So it made
people who were not Christians very ruthless. And then at that time
