I. Military Development-continued
"The Selective Service draft boards can and do draft married men with dependents. If two members of the board are prejudiced against the draftee they can draft him regardless of how many children he has." (C. P. A. and member of draft board in first World War, Birmingham, 8/7/42.)

"It's common knowledge that England won't fight. She never has. She has always hired her fighting done - but when we know this why should we pay the price of our sons for her? When England and America fight it out we'll fight her to a finish." (College student, Birmingham, 8/7/42.)

II. Class Conflict.
"We're losing this war because Labor is ruling the Government. I believe in organized labor all right, but I don't believe in these fellows worth $50 to $100 up there telling the real backbone of American Democracy what to do." (Business Man, Birmingham, 8/7/42.)

"Our main issue isn't racial relations - it's labor - inefficient labor running out Government. Boys worth $60 to $125 a month in normal times making over $400 a month now." (Government official, Anniston, Ala., 8/7/42.).

"We are going to have a political fight in Washington - the officials are already mixed up. They are robbing the Government left and right because they know they won't be in power long - and so are robbing the American people." (Business man, Birmingham, 8/5/42).
