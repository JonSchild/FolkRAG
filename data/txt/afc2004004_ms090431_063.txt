When the shootin was over,
Ollie looked back and [said] stayed.
He put his pistol in his pocket
And done a slow break day?  away?
When you lose, etc.

When the inquest was held,
[Was over] Folks listened and alooked.
They all spoke [their well] very well,
Joey Fountain and Big Thrush[l].
When yo u lose, etc.

Mrs. Carr said to the surgeon,
"I wish you had come soon,
And I reckon Ollie Jackson's
A little Kansas City coon."
When you lose, etc.

On 1900 Chestnut were heard a dismal noise,
How two bully gamblers
Met their deza th,
Two Kansas City boys.
When you lose, etc.

The day was set for the trial,
All around the city line,
They said old Ollie Jackson
Would have to do some time.
When you lose, etc.

Joey Fountain and Big T[h]rush
They both [had] did all they could.
But [all] if Ollie got one
On the Head,
It would have done them boys no good.
When you lose, etc.

Now, girls and boys, please take my advice :
Don't never try to gamble
With a pair of loaded dice.
When you lose, etc.

That's from Kansas City.
