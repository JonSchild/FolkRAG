3) I bore her to the wild woods green where many werr the summer blossoms,
Placed with the branches soft and green around her blood-stained bosom.
Then I knelt and kissed her pale, pale cheek, then rushed o'er hill and valley,
My vengeance on the foe to wreak, while the soft winds shook the barley.

4) And blood for blood without remorse I've taken in the hollow,
While the mourners placed my true love's corpse where I, too, soon may follow.
And round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early,
With a breaking heart whene'er I hear the soft wind shake the barley.
