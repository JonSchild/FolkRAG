Dear Mr. Morris:

I hate to be a pest, but you did promise to pay $25.00
for the long distance 'phone calls I had to make and
will make. Believe me, the bill is going to amount
to more that that.

Also, I note in the Hobart Smith Contract that you
have not provided him room accommodations, and I
guarantee that he is going to squak, but that is your
problem.

I've sent the contracts off to Bessie Jones, and they
will buy their tickets as soon as you sent them their
fare money care of my sister, Bess Hawes, 1628 Palm
Court, Santa Monica, California.

I will be on hand in 
Asheville the morning of the 27th
to work with the Negro program and will be glad to help
you in any other way I can through Saturday. I think
my wife will be coming down with me and hope you will
arrange accommodations for us for those two or three
nights. Let me know about this, please.

Sincerely yours, and best luck,

Alan Lomax

P. S. The two people that I would like to bring from the
Sea Islands at $25.00 per performance plus travel and
accommodations are Peter Davis and Alberta Ramsay. Both
can be reached at Route 4, Box 232, St. Simons Island,
Georgia. My suggestion is that you send them two round-trip
tickets with $5.00 apiece for food on the way and
back. I an writing them separately that they can expect
to hear from you.
