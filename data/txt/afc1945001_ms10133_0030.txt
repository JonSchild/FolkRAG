Senior N.M,
1. Another war for democracy eh? My God the
things done in the name of democracy! What will
they do next?
2. If this is for the democracy I have 
known then I might as well fight on
the home front.
3. They ask me to ration things - Hell I
have been rationing all my life.
4. "Look out," I'll say to the hard boiled white
draft agent from the south, "I might get you
confused with the other dictators."
5. Give your life
To win the strife
But freedom for you
Under the red white and blue
Comes later for Greek
Negro and Jew
