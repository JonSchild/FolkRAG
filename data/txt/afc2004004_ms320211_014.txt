AL ROSE    -13

LOMAX      Oh really?

ROSE          Yes.  But he was a blind musician
who had a group around him and he played guitar and, in
those days he played zither.   But he was playing guitar and
banjo as I remember him.   And I think he died about only  ,
oh, in 1954 or '5.

LOMAX      Gee.

ROSE          And. . .

LOMAX      What, what were the tunes that he
played? [UNCLEAR]

ROSE          Well he, [LAUGHS]  They played
Mamma's Baby Boy, of course, in various . . .Mamma's Baby Boy
was just, just general  [UNCLEAR].

LOMAX      I don't know that tune. That's
funny.

ROSE          You might know it as Do what 
[Orie] say.

LOMAX      I don't know.

ROSE          You don't know that.

LOMAX      Could you hum it?

ROSE          [WHISTLES]  I can't do it with
them playing out there.

LOMAX      Oh yeah, right.  Right.

ROSE          But, it's a very, very com, it was
the most common tune there I would say.  Shimmie Like My
Sister Kate was derived from what was fundamentally a
trombone part in a band.  And of course they. . . .
