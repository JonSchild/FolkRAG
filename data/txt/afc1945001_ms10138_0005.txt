Little Bo Peep has lost her jeep, 
and don't know where to find it.  
Leave it alone, and It'll come home, 
Dragging a Jap Behind it.  

Teacher;  What do you know about Italy? 
Pupil;  All I know is that it is shaped like 
a boot and runned by a heel.  

Sargent;  "How do you feel this morning after 
a night's sleep in an army cot?" 
Private;  "Just fine sir.  You see, I got up for 
a couple of hours and rested."
