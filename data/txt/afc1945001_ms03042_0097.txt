I. Heard August 5, 1942 on train from New York City to New Rochelle


Fort Slocum, in New Rochelle, is filling up with hundreds
of soldiers. Whenever soldiers come to Fort Slocum,
you can be sure that they will not be there for long, but 
will be shipped out overseas. You know this is a port of 
embarkation for our troops and they have sent out hundreds
of soldiers already. Also, when the troops are sent in, they 
usually come in very late at night so that people will not 
see them or know how many soldiers are assigned to the fort. [*1*]
