"Describe her to me," I says.
He says, "It's a sort of black pony, thick made."
I says, "That's my poney."
Well, he says I'll have to get away along there. My wife goes
across the road to a house and gets the lassie's bicycle, and
she goes up for the pony. She went away for the pony. But it was
a very wicked pony. To tell you the  truth, he didn't like no man.
The man I got him from had bad-used him. He would kick a man to
death as far as I heard. I knew it afterwards - it was a wicked
pony. But he would let a woman walk away with him as long as he 
liked. He'd never touch a woman. That's how she went away for the
pony. She come back in about an hour's time sitting on the pony's
back. She could ride a pony, my wife. She'd no reins - she just
had the winklers.
I said, "Where's the girl's bicycle?"
"O God," she said, "I left it lying at the roadside."
Well, I had to go back for the bycycle, walk on my feet. And I
got back with that bicycle about eight o'clock at night. My feet
was sore with walking. The bike was lying at the roadside - I
took the girl's bike back. I'll always remember that - my feet was
all sore walking. That's an accident I won't forget. . . .
     Another time I had a deal with a tinker of ponies in Limerick.
Now, Limerick, it's a big town, more of a city. We stayed right
in the centre of the town - there's a big fair ground, a fair
green put there for the travellers, and you pay so much every
night - a couple of bob a night for a camp. If you've got a wagon
it's fourshillings a night. A shilling a wheel. And your pony
can eat up and down with other ponies on the green. But the pony
I had was a piebald pony - oh, a  good pony, cost me a bit of
money, that pony, - about 27 pound. But, I'm sitting drinking my tea
one night in the wagon, some Irish traveller says to me, "Are
you a Jock?"
I says, "I am."
"God," says he, "I don't see your pony no place at all. Is your pony
the piebald? White with reddish piebalds?"
I says, "That's mine."
Me says, "It's not among our ponies. If it's wandered down the
town," he says, "and the Civic Guards get hold of him, they'll
put him in the pound."
"Oh I see," says I. I goes away and looks for the pony. My wife
says I'd better go. On up around about the town - up the street,
down the next street, no sign of the pony at all. Till two boys
come over to the wagon and told me a pony was stuck in the ditch,
in a sort of bog out the end of town. About two miles out of town.
In a bog - bog of water - a pony in there is likely to sink or
drown. So we had an awful carry-on to get the pony out. It was
all dubbs, we call it, covered from head to foot. We had to wash
it all. So after that I said "Tie it up and give it a bundle of
hay. It'll wander no more" - because 'twas an awful horse to
wander away.
