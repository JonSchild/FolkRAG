real cowboy, [using] in cowboy manner and phrasing, tell the stories of "The Dying Cowboy, "The Old Chisholm Trail" and of the "Little Dogies"; in remote districts of the South black labor in gangs yet picture the surge and hum of labor-- the clang of hammers on steel bolts, the ring of the cane knife, the swish of hoes cutting grass roots, the slow movement of lazy mules up and down the banks of a levee--through the medium of song with graphic words fitted into unique and little know musical forms.
