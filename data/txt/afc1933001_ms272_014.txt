Cindy

1. You ought to see my Cindy
She lives away down South;
An' she's so sweet the honey bees
swarm around her mouth.

Chorus:
Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy,
Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy,
Get along, home, Cindy, Cindy,
I'll marry you sometime.

2. I wish I was an apple,
A hangin' on the tree,
And ev'ry time my that Cindy passed,
She'd take a bite of me. Chorus:

3. She took me to the parler,
She cooled me with her fan,
She swore that I's the putiest thing
in the shape of mortal man. Chorus:

4. She told me that she loved me,
She called me sugar plum,
She throwed'er arms around me,
I thought my time had come. Chorus:

5. Oh where did you git your liquor,
Oh where'd you git your dram,
I got it from a lady
away down in Rockin ham. Chorus:

6. Cindy got religion,
She had it once before,
When she heard my old banjo
She 'us the first us on the floor. Chorus:

7. I wish I had a needle,
As fine as I could sew,
I'd sew the girls to my coat tail,
and down the road I'd go. Chorus:

The New River Train

O baby remember what you said
O baby remember what you said
Remember what you said
You would rather see me dead
Than riding on that New River Train

O baby you can't love two
" " " " " " "
You can't love two, the way I love you.
O baby you can't love two.
O baby you can't love three
" " " " " " "
You can't love three and get along with me.
O baby you can't love three
O baby you can't love four
" " " " " " "
You can't love four and
Have a key to my front door
O baby you can't love four.

Old Joe Clark

Old Joe Clark, the Preacher's son
He preached all over the plain.
The highest text he ever took
Was high, low Jack and the game.

Chorus:
Round an' around, Old Joe Clark,
Round an' around we're gone.
Round an' around, Old Joe Clark,
An' bye-bye Lucy Long.

There was a house in Baltimore
Sixteen stories high,
An' every story in that house
Was full of chicken pie. Chorus:

I went down to see my gal,
She met me at the door
Shoes and stockin's in her hand
An' her feet all over the floor. Chorus:

On, Brave Old Army Team

The Army team's the pride and dream
of every heart in gray.
The Army line you'll ever find
A terror in the fray.
And when the team is fighting
for the Black and Gray and Gold
We're always near with song and cheer
to "sound off" strong and bold:

Whistle -- Rah: Rah: Boom!

Chorus:

On, brave old Army Team on to the fray.
Fight on to Victory
For that's the fearless Army way.

La Cucaracha

When a fellow loves a maiden
and that maiden doesn't love him,
It's the same as when a bald man
finds a comb upon the highway.

Chorus:
The cucaracha, the cucaracha
Doesn't want to travel on
Because she hasn't oh, no she hasn't
Marihauna for to smoke.
