Dear Alan,

I am sorry that my brief visit in Washington had
to come at the time of week when you are out of
town. To keep from losing my balance (which is not
easy to keep when one works for a "Cause"), I am 
now writing an article or monograph about the 
Cowboy Dance in the Southwest, a subject in which
I thought you might be interested and on which you 
might have some valuable suggestions, particularly 
in the section on fiddle tunes. I have seen almost
everything in print, but there were two or three
fife books, especially "The American Veteran Fifer,"
which I did not get to examine. If you could note
the names of tunes in the A.V.F., or at least the
name of the publisher, I'd appreciate it very much.
Best regards to your family.
                         Olcutt
