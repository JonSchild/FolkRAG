"We are tracing down rumors every day of so and so getting a typewriter
when he isn't eligible for it. Just this morning, some school official repoted
that another school official in an adjacent town had gotten a machine and we
checked and found it wasn't true." Typewriter salesman 8-5-42.
"I understand there is a lot of violation of the typewriter freezing
order, because of the provisions that individuals may sell single typewriters which
makes an easy way around the order if you want to take the risk." Another typewriter
salesman 8-6-42.
"My father said the salesman told him grocery stores are raising
their prices all over the state." Daughter of store operator. 8-4-42.
"The grocers say they get so many forms and regulations to read that
they can't read them all and they find they are violating without knowing it."
Des Moines business man 8-8-42.
"Can you tell me any reason why they should raise their prices in
the restaurants as much as they are. Food prices are surely not that muchout
of line." business woman 8-8-42.
"They tell me that tires you could buy for $2 you have to pay $10 for
now. I don't know whether they have price ceilings on those used tires or not."
An especially intelligent and well informed postman. 8-6-42.
Last weekend there was a general rumor that gasoline rationing was to
go into effect in Iowa on Sunday and at least a dozen persons of whom we know
filled up their tanks in anticipation.
"I keep my tank filled all the time because I think we are going to
have gasoline rationing one of these days without any warning." Insurance executive
8-4-42.
"I wish I had a big tank I could store some gasoline in so I wouldn't
get caught when they put on this rationing stunt." Business man 8-3-42.
