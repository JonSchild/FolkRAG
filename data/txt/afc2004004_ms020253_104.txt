THIS SAME JESUS

This same Jesus
Who walked to Galilee, 
Oh, this same Jesus
Who shed his blood for me, 
Well, this same Jesus
Who died out on the tree, 
Now, this same Jesus will save your soul. 

Oh, this same Jesus
Who was harked and spit upon, 
Now, this same Jesus
Who died on Calvary, 
Oh, this same Jesus
Who shed his blood for me, 
Lawd, this same Jesus will save your soul. 

I'm talkin' about Jesus, 
Whose name I have been taught, 
I'm talkin' about Jesus, 
Who died to save my soul, 
I'm talkin' about Jesus, 
Who died on Calvary, 
Now, this same Jesus will save your soul. 

Now, this same Jesus
Whose name I have been taught, 
Now, this same Jesus
Who died out on the cross, 
Oh, this same Jesus
Who shed his blood for me, 
Lawd, this same Jesus will save your soul.
