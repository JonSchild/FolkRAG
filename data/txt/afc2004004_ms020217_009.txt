BJ    R. 2,   P. 8

So that's what it means; that the Lord will do the law, [as you all bid,] is you goin' obey the
law [and all], but you must [keep] 'member Jesus within. You see, the law without.
And all is vanished.  'Cause one day all that['s] goin pass away, y'see.
But Jesus will never pass away because he's within.  That's why we
have to be -- that's why we , ([CHOOSE] show you in short ?) an' the
womens the leader and the mens the leader of the different churches
an' things; every one's supposed to be within. If [you] they have Jesus
within, then you can do your part, 'cause He said, "That [what's] in
you don't hurt you; that what comes out..." And so, if you go in the
water, you be baptized -- a lot of people b'lieve this -- they go in
the water and be baptized -- a lot of 'em that holy believe this, too --
and then that's all [yaâ€™ need] it need. But it's a mistake. you see, you remember You member when Jesus and 
John [went in] met to that water and Jesus told John to baptize him, and John
told Jesus, "I need to be baptized [by] of you."  And then Jesus said,
" [(Some it to??)]  Suffer it to be so." And he went down,
an' he baptize Jesus, an' Jesus come straightway up out of the water.
Then what the[y was] word was together.  Said, "I'm gonna decrease and you'll
increase" y'see?  So John decreased, y'see?  Jesus increased. That
mean to say that this: 'Cause you gotta be baptized in [the] water
[it's a (habitation?)] is the interpretation of the inward soul you see.  But yet and still, if you
don't get it, if he you baptized you you inward you clean. That's all.
