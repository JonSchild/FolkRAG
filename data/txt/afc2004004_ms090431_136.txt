A: Do you know any more of that song?
R: Well, no sir. Forest [Jump] Jones was a pretty bad man. He'd a [place on] big levee camp
[Arkansas] down there in Ark just between Brook[burgh]boro down there and White River Bottom.
Well, what made him so bad I could[n’t] see. [Had no whole] He had all the skinners, 
AD skinners, some sixty skinners, and me and my brother, we stopped 
in there just by Mr. [George] Font’s camp. We stopped in there to get a job.
Well, and my brother say, "Well, we'll take a look over this camp before 
we start to work." I said, "Yeah. that would be a pretty good 
idea."
So we stayed around there for a few minutes, right across skip on a 
sixty. [A man] Mr. Forrest walked down there[. “Guy,”] , “Say”  can't you drive this[?] cat.”
Say, "Yessir. I been pulling it now for four years." "Yessir, but 
you ain't pulling it right." So he uncrossed [again] the gear and told him "If 
you hang it up again," say, "Me and you going [for] on the dock." All 
right. He put um down [in] the bottom. He gonna straighten himself. [That]
[Gonna] guy put up, I say, about half top [place] station. He cross um up in that 
fix again. So [the boss] Mr. Forrest walked down there and got him a root. I 
ain't gonna tell you how they [put] whipped that nigger [there] ‘s ass.
