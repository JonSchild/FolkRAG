1. The editor and publisher of the "Pink Reporter" is now working
on some defense project in Salt Lake City, Utah. Just can't imagine
employing this type of person in a defense plant. He never did a
constructive thing or tried to help, but yet, there he is reaping the
fruits. (State department division head)
(The "Pink Reporter" was a radical, sourrilous sheet. The
publisher has been accused of blackmail practices. The
paper was pro-Wheeler, anti-Russia, anti-Murray, anti-Semetic,
anti-Administration and particularly anti-Roosevelt. Referred
to the President as "Rosenfeld." The publisher was sued for
slander and libel--cased dismissed--asked to leave town.)
