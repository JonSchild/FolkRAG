is E. C. Booze, whose brick house is at the south end of the row. Beside it is the massive brick house of the founder of the community, Isiah T. Montgomery, and now occupied by his two daughters. Next is the home of the Mayor of the town. Other imposing homes are occupied by those planters who have retained possession of their plantations. Many of the people who belonged to this experiment in establishing a Negro community where Negroes could work out their own destinies are scattered throughout the United States. Of those remaining, the most active are descendants of the founders. The present Mayor was the first child born in the town, and received his education at Fisk and Harvard Universities. The head of the Mound Bayou Foundation is the son-in-law of I. T. Montgomery, the founder of the town, and his wife is the Republican Committee Woman for  Mississippi.

All about these "urban communities" are the plantations which are communities in themselves. Owners' homes are well constructed and beautiful, with large barns and equipment sheds behind them. Scattered about in the cotton fields are the weather-beaten shacks in which the croppers live. Bound together in an economic enterprise, croppers, planters, plantation functionaries constitute a self-contained social unit. Inter-dependence and association have developed a pattern of relationships and ritual, governing the living together of the various elements of the plantation community.

The Agricultural Pattern
In this area the most common type of tenancy is the share-tenancy and cropping. Share and cash renters are not encouraged on the large estates. Negro tenants are preferred to white, because of their "docility", and as compared with white operators of the same status, their superior stamina.
