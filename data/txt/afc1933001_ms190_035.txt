Mr. Lomax

March 4, 1943

Dear Mr. Haygood:

     Mr. Alan Lomax has sent me a copy of his letter to
you of February 8 with a request that I send you my comments.
I find Mr. Lomax's proposals very interesting and
should like to take this opportunity to express our interest
in them. We are particularly interested in the two projects
of Mr. Pipes and Professor James which should produce
valuable additions to our Archive of American Folk
Song if they can be arranged. The Library of Congress
might be able to allot a moderate sum of money to take
care of the necessary recording discs, etc. Of course,
you realize that the Library cannot make a commitment until
the projects have been described in greater detail and
the Library's responsibilities more clearly defined.
If you will send us copies of the projects when they are
submitted to you, we shall be glad to give immediate
consideration to them.

     Faithfully yours,

     Arhibald MacLeish
     The Librarian of Congress
