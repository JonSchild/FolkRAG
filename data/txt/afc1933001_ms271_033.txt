THE LITTLE BROWN JUG GOES MODERN

Adolph Hitler, the bullyin' bum
Decided the whole world he would run,
He built his army in secret speed
And started out with his Blitzkrieg.
He first took Poland, then he took France,
He marched right through with a goosestep dance,
But the Allies stopped him when they got their chance
And they'll march him back by the seat of his pants!

Chorus: Hey, hey, You and me,
The end of that bully we soon shall see.
Hey, hey, how glad we'll be
When Hitler swings from the limb of a tree.

Then Mussolini thought that he'd jump in
And divide the world with his maniac friend,
But Hitler gobbled 'til he made himself sick
And Mussolini just got the plate to lick.
Then the fascists thought they'd carve a piece
But they got burned by red hot "Greece"!
Italy'd be all right we feel,
But it's shaped like a boot and run by a heel!

Chorus: Hey, hey, you and me
The end of Mussolini we soon shall see.
Hey, hey, how glad we'll be
When Mussolini swings from the limb of a tree.

They said our freedom had made us weak,
They said our system had made us meek,
But we'll answer them now with planes and tanks,
If Hitler says "Peace", we'll say, "no, thanks."
We've got a billion friends and relations,
We've got our buddies in the United Nations,
When we get through with our Axis foe,
They just won't be there no mo!

Chorus: Hey, hey, you and me
The end of the Axis we soon shall see.
Hey, hey, how glad we'll be
When the Axis swings from the limb of a tree.
