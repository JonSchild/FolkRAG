JINNIE GET AROUND.
Chorus I:
O git around, Jinnie xx git around
Oh git around, I say
Oh git around, Jinnie git around
All on a summer day
Chorus II: 
Want to git your eye knocked out
Want to git your fill
Want to get your eye knocked out
Git on the mountain mill.
My true love upon the mountain
Bowing up and down
If I had my broad axe here
I'd hew the mountain down.  Cho. I. & II.
Jaybird up in the acorn tree
Shaking acorns down
My true love in the sugar tree,
Shakin' sugar down.   Cho. I. & II. 
Sixteen horses to my carriage,
Drive 'em down to town,
Almost break my dovey's heart,
To see me hold 'em down.   Cho.  I. & II. 
Built me house in Baltymore,
Sixteen stories high, 
Every story in my house
Filled with chicken pie.   Chorus I.
Sing on the mountain hill,
Sing on the mountain hill,
Sing on the mountain hill, my love,
I will have my fun. 
I'm goin' up on Grabble Dick,
I'm goin' up next Friday
I'm goin' up on Grabble Dick,
And marry Miss Betsy Friday. 
I will have my fun, my love,
I will have my fun,
Take my glass away from me,
I don't want no more.   Chorus II.
