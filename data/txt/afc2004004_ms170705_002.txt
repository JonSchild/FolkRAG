TAPE 81: THE MINEHEAD HOBBY HORSE.

Boy:  Hey, Alfie. ARE YOU GOING TO COME out this afternoon?
Alf:  Yes, I think the weather's going to be alright. I don't see
why it shouldn't. Good prospects of it. And you fellows'll be
coming out as well. You have to carry it on after I'm gone, you know.
I hope you will, because we've been carrying on a good many years now,
and our forefathers before us. And we want you young fellows that have
an interest in it for to have a go, too - don't let the old trandition
down. . . . Now in olden days when there was men that used to take the
hobby horse about, they used to drive the little fellows off the street.
I think that's wrong, because everybody's got to learn and they all
enjoy it. Well, why not? And I think you should know as you're
growing up and taking over these here jobs, that you should learn
something about this hobby horse.
     Now in this here hobby horse there's an old trandition that's been
carried on for years and years, in fact, hundreds of years. One says
its to drive away the evil spirits from the harbour, the other to
save us from the invasion of the Danes - drove the Danes out of the 
town - this is what we're taught to believe from generation down,
from our forefathers back. And if you will take the spirit into heart
with all these old tranditions -- and you chaps, it's my one wish
for 'ee to continue my job. . .And we don't want to see these old
tranditions go down. And I'll be pleased to see you out. As long as 
you does your bit, keeps to yourselves, does your own work, and that's
all that's required. And anything I can do anytime for help 'ee, in
making or showing of this hobby horse. . . .
     Do you know the routes of the hobby horse, in which the
tranditions is  going to be carried out? Well, the first night, as you
all know, is the last of April. Well, that is what they call "thw
short 'un" and your first day of May is "White cross." Well, White
Cross is a trandition that's been carried out for years upon years,
and that is to bring the hobby horse to White Cross, and the simple
reason for why is this. When they were supposed to be invaded by the
Danes, they had a festival of winning and driving the Danes from the 
shores; they went there to have their celebrations. There was women
of all descriptions and there was a May Queen who rode on a May Bush
upon a chair. Then they used to go back through Mineahead to have
their jubilee. Then the actual thing after that that used to be the
recognized thing, go to White Cross to have your breakfast. If you
don't go to White Cross at 6 o'clock in the morning the whole thing
is at a loss because the old time distance is that route, and that
route's to be done on the first of May until the 3rd of May. And if
a Sunday comes in between you've still got an extra day to continue.
You're allowed three actual days to do your work. Now there's a Dunster
route - you must go to the castle, because he was the Lord of the
Manor - the Littrels, - they were a loyal firm to the country at the
time years gone by when each county was fighting the other. . .
