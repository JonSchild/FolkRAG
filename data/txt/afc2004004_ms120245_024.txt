The voodou dances here in Haiti are all highly
feminine.  The movements are all 
[connected with] breast and belly and
hip shimmieing and screwing -- definitely
the female movements of the 
sex act.  Then too in these dances
the woman gets the chance to assume
vicariously the masculine role.
Zuma is the first of her kind I have 
ever met - broad, bawdy, spoiled,
sexy, a racconteur like a man -- 
I wonder if everyone would go in 
for vulgarities and common-place jokes
if they felt a sense of themselves as does
Zuma.  With a reputation as a writer
and the career of a world-famous dancer
behind her, she sees no need to be or 
say anything but what she wants --
except in the way of a little empty
feminine chatter. - which of course
brings her attention and the kind 
she is after -- a huge shaggy
head -- enormous black eyes
