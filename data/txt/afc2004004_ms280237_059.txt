I don't take - I don't notice the hair nor yet the eyes.
Lomax: What made you interested in her first?  Do you remember

Lomax: Did you make love to her before you all were married?

Lomax: But you all slept together a bit before you got married

Then they give you the chuck out, they won't ha' you."  (laughs)
That's how he used to tell me.
Lomax: And you followed his advice?
Cox: Yeah.  I - [I] no use[d] to keep playin' about with it.  (pause)
