Dear Mr.Lomax,
    I am sorry I had not time to contact
you, or write, before you left London.  I was, as you know
about to settle in Gloucester when I received your letter
asking me if I would forward a recording of myself.
I then explained why that was impossible and said I
would call on you before you left London.  On arrival in
Gloucester I found I could be free to visit you on the
Saturday previous to your departure.  I then wrote making
an appointment around 3:0'0' , and  by not appearing, I
must have caused you annoyance.  I apoligise now, but
hurry with the explaination.  On the Thursday of that
week it was my unfortunate experience to receive a
Telegram from my father requesting I return home as
my mother, who was ailing for the past three months,
has suddenly become seriously ill, and the doctor had
hopes that were very slight, of her recovery.  I naturally
dropped everything on hand.  But, I am glad to say a good
improvement has unexpectedly occurred in her health
which promises a slow but steady progress.  I am very
anxious to hear from you again so I trust you now
