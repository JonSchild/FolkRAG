Renton, Washington
August 3, 1942

Officer of large war industry said, "Kaiser is a renegade in business.
He never was much of a success as a contractor in Washington.

He has disrupted the whole labor market of the Northwest enticing mechanics
from lumber mills and other industries with higher wages and bonuses.

Kaiser maintains a publicity and public relations department which costs
$100,000 a year."      [*22*]
