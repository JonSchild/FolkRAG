today and miss tomorrow. 
The girl - me father's second wife, she's a nice little woman, 
small, round-featured and black-hair, - but small, and not a 
great shape, very small and plumpy-like. The Uncle's married to 
her sister when I was small. I suppose they were seeing one 
another. So Jimmy, Maggie, me father and me went for s stroll 
down Kenturk, and they came to the house; and they had very bad 
manners. This plumpy one I was telling you about - Eileen is 
her name - this one that's married to my uncle is Margaret, and 
Eileen is her sister. I'm going to tell you the plain, honest 
truth, that when she came to Kentirk, I didn't like her one bit. 
She was around me father a lot. 

Lomax: Was she staying with him before they were married ? 

Barry: That's what I'm saying. She was runninh about him a lot, 
and my father is a good-looking man. Nice features. But whenever 
this one come around she was running around him here. Then they 
started to go off, and off I goes with my father. He takes me 
away with him. Before her first baby was born they weren't 
married at the time. And herfather and mother followed her up. 
I don't know - he might have married her, he might not - but I 
know one thing anyway, - her father and mother followed up the 
whole lot and got the two of them married in Limerick. I was with 
them. Running about for a little while, Then we had boardings. 

Lomax: You must have been pretty lonesome and neglected. 

Barry: I was, andvery badly neglected. I used to be left in a 
room by myself for a whole long day. Sometimes I'd have a bite, 
sometimes I wouldn't, waiting for them to come back and get some food. 

Lomax: Would you be laughing and dancing and amusing yourself ? 

Barry: I wouldn't, because I wasn't much morethan 14. I remember 
one time. . . . . It's not like nowadays, when everybody has their 
own private room. But in that time, this big tenement house 
-- in one room there's a couple lying here and a couple lying there, 
and 'twas all one big family - no separation. Man and wife here 
and man and wife in another bed, and man and wife in another bed. 
The way I used to do, I used to sleep in the bottom part of the 
bed. We always used to join in, the three of us. I'd sleep at 
the bottom, and the other two at the top. My step-mother and father. 

Lomax: You must have known waht was going on in thenight then. 
Couldn't miss it. 

Barry: Couldn't I suppose. But I never took an interest in 
that. I always slept very sound. It wasn't for too long.
