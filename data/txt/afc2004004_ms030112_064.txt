LIONEL: Still continue on the 3rd roll.

MRS. DAVIS:
The way he could tell about things, is feel around, because
he couldn't see.

LIONEL:
Start from the beginning and tell us about the house.

MRS. DAVIS:
Oh, well when I got this house, the man who we bought this
house from lived out here and so he called and he say we could
close the deal on a Thursday, but I say, Rev. Davis is not in
the city. He say that doens't matter as long as you got some
money. See, I'll come out to you, we had a deal on the house
I tell you, make a down payment on the house which I did, So
he as coming out riding in the car, Look like we were going
to the end of noplace. He says You're going to the end of 
somewhere. Which I really didn't like when I got out here,
but that was my word that took him riding out here I felt
seeing that we were going to the end of no where, he says No
miss you going to the end of somewhere. Well he told the truth,
cause I really like it better and better each day I live out here.
So I was very grateful and proud. Rev. Davis worked very hard to
get what he wanted to get.

LARRY:
What he say, when he come off the road that night? He
stayed up all night long.

MRS. DAVIS:
All night long feeling in the corner, cause he couldn't see
and he could tell as much about how a thing was I could tell myself.
And so we was very grateful and had a moving van to move me.
