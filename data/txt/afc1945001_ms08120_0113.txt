When my brother
came back from England,
he told all about his visit to
the priest. He said the priest
gave him a little gold pen,
and he has kept it all these
years. He also told how he had
to stay in cold shelters night
after night listening for a bomb
to drop on them. He had to
lie next to dead men just
waiting. It almost drove him
out of his mind. But soon
they captured the nazis
and were on they way home.
