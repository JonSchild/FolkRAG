Subject: Army use of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps 

The Army plans to put women in the ordnance factories and the 
holding and reconsignment points in such isolated or desert 
towns as Hermiston, Oregon, Pasco,Washington, and Yermo and 
Sierra Ordnance Depot, California, because it will be impossible 
to get civilian women to go to those places at civil 
service wages. This is the only way the Amry feels it can 
staff such establishments.
