Dear Harold,
I'd like to hear your verdict on the first 
performance. Personally I feel much relieved that it's
over and much surer about going ahead with subsequent
performances. On my arrival I was given a thorough raking 
over the coals by Levine and Feinschrieber who evidently felt 
it was time to take me down a notch. I bore this with calm 
and good humor, although they were not entirely honest 
or just in what they said. My relationship with [w] them is 
completely smooth now and I'm working on the first scripts 
with Fienschrieber. Unless you need me urgently, I think 
I'd better stay here and rehearse and write steadily until 
after the tenth. I really need a week to get my soul set 
for the first show. After that it'll be easy. Please forward 
my mail at once to Hotel Albert, 64 University Place, NYC and 
special delivery my pay-check--- which the disbursing 
office failed to do after having promised me to. If you 
need the report before the tenth , let me know. Otherwise 
I'd rather ruminate in peace on radio.
I've discussed publicity with the proper department
and I'd like
