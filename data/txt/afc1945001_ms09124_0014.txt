There New Tune[?]
1. Hitler - " I'll have the Craziest Dreams"
2. Hirohito - "I had a Dream too."
3. Musolinni - "Send me one dozen Roses."
4. Stalin - "There'll be some Changes made."

These dreams will come true 
If you pull thru 
With those "War Bond's & Stamps."

Don't be a, "Sap",
Let's wipe the "Japs."  
Right off the "Maps."
