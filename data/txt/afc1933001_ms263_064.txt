Pauline: sung by Allen Prothro's Quartet, Nashville Penitentary,
July, 1933.

I am going to my shanty and lie down;
Pauline, Pauline,
Be a friend to me;
Pauline, Pauline,
Be a friend to me.

I will give you more gold,
Than your apron can hold;
Pauline, be a friend to me.

Pauline, Pauline,
Won't you come back home?
I will give you more gold
Than your apron can hold ----.
