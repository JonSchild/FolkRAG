9. 

And how bitterly she did weep. 
She wept, she mourned, she tore her hair, 
Cryin', "Alas, what shall I do? 
This night I resolved to sleep with you 
For fear of the foggy dew." (repeats last four lines) 

Now all the first part of the night, 
How we did sport and play; 
And all the later part of the night, 
She in my arms did lay. 
And when broad daylight did appear, 
She cried, "I am undone." 
"Oh, hold your tongue, you silly [little girl] young girl, 
For the foggy dew is gone." (repeats last four lines) 
"Supposin' that you should have one child, 
It would make you laugh and smile; 
Supposin' that you should have another, 
It would make you think a while. 
Supposin' that you should have another, 
Another, another one too, 
It would make you leave off these foolish young tricks 
And think of the foggy dew." (repeasts last four lines) 
I loved that girl with all my heart, 
Loved her as I loved my life, 
And in the [early] other part of the year 
I made her my lawful wife. 
I never told her of her faults, 
Yet never intend to do; 
Yet many a time when she winks and smiles 
I think of the foggy dew." (repeats last four lines) 

Lomax: Harry, what's the - where did you learn this one? 

Cox: Oh, I learnt it off an old bloke used to be about there.
