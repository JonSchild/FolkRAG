finds that should go into
the book even if other
stuff already chosen
must [in] be omitted?
Take a few hours to
consider and plan and 
write me your full
mind. Meanwhile I
am pulling at Macmillan
to give us more pages.

As you can easily guess
I am anxious to see Bess
stand high in her College
work, even to winning a
European Fellowship. What
impression do you get of her
interest in her studies? She
hasn't told us much. And
wont you try to reply to
this letter soon. We are proud
of our Oxford Book of Light Verses.

Affectionately, Father.
