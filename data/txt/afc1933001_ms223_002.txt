Dear Alan:

You will see that the
manuscript has been in for
a month. At the same time
Mr. Putman writes me that
he is again asking Ruth for
it, though he is not hopeful
of any success. Get yourself
into the picture and
write me. Please also fail
not in completing the Introduction. 
You may have
to decline some invitations,
