     A                            Rumors
    A young Lt. Commander (Annapolis '39)
heard with consternation a rumor 
that the Wives were going to be assigned 
to the amunition room below deck
on ships. "Jiminy Crickets", he grumbled
"you'd think those fellows in Wash.
would know how long you always
have to wait for women in the
powder room."
