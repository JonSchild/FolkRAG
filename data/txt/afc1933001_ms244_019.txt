to relieve my mind. I have one
certain ally who, as surely as
night follows day, will vindicate
my conclusion. Let me
urge you again to read Percy's
Lanterns on the Levee. His father and
grandfather before him spent
their lives in the Delta. Carl Sandburg
writes of him: "If a heart
and mind haunted by some of
the most ancient issues of justice
and charity count, if
candor and honesty and forthright
confession counts, this
rates among the autobiographies 
requisite to understanding
America". Roark Bradford
adds: Will Percy learned
as a boy what the sociologist
never can learn. Namely, what
a crawfish says, when he rares
back at you. Lovingly, Father

Shirley and her family came in tonight, en
route to Corpus. Tomorrow we all go together
to see the Texas-Oklahoma gameâ€”
How I wish you were along!
