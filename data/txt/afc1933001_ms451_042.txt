OLD BLUE
I raised a dog and his name was Blue,
And I betcha five dollars he's a good one too.
Saying "Come on, Blue,
Boo-hoo."
Shoulder my axe and I tooted my horn,
Gonna get me a possum in the new ground corn.
Saying, "Come on, Blue, 
Boo-hoo."
Old Blue treed, I went to see; 
There say the posson on a 'simmon tree.
That possum clumb down on a swingin' limb
Blue barked at the possum, possum growled
at him
Saying, "Come on, Blue,
Boo-hoo."
He grinned at me, I looked at him,
I shook him out; Blue took him in.
Got that possum and I put him in a sack,
Next thing I knew,  had him on my back
Saying, Come on, Blue
Boo-hoo"
Bake that possum good and brown
And I lay them sweet potatoes round and round.
Saying, "Come on, Blue,
you kin have some too."
"Blue, what makes your eyes so red?"
"I've run them 'possums till I'm almost dead."
When old Blue died, he died so hard,
That he shook the ground in my back yard.
Saying, "Go on, Blue,
I'm coming too."
Old Blue died; I laid him in the shade,
I dug his grave with a silver spade.
I let him down with a golden chain;
Link by link slipped through my hand.
There is only one thing that bothers my mind,
Blue went to heaven, left me behind.
When I get there, first thing I'll do,
Grab me a horn and blow for old Blue.
