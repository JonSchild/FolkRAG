In dealing with supernatural rumors, it should be recognized
that some of them may be quite harmless.  As has been pointed
out, for some members of the Community its, attack on this type of
rumor is useless.

Since there must be variety in rumors dealt with, and counter-
acting approaches, in order to be effective, it would seem
wise to classify supernatural rumors into the relatively harmless
variety and those which are harmful or potentially harmful.

Public denials should be restricted to the latter class.
