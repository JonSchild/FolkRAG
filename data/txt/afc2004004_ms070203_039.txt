he told them to be quiet -
 but they kept fooling & 
Raymond came up to the 
counter & pushed a young 
lady customer to one side
 & began to let water - 
as soon as I heard the 
water run - I went over 
the counter & he caught me 
a good crack in the eye - 
well I had a good ring
on and caught him a 
crack that sent him 
between two pork barrels
then I jumped right in 
his face & stomped 
the tar out of him - 
he then came back
with a plow handle 
paralyzed big
