     Now I'm gon tell you:  God didn't intend fur this thang
to h appen to start wid.  But now, heah what the trouble.  God made
Eve fur Adam.  But He tole Adam not to go into Eve.  He tole him,
"The day you eat of this fruit, the day you shall die."  Not that
He intended for him to go all his life not to tetch her, you understand.
But see, Adam was made full of the Holy Ghost to start wid.
And God didn't want Adam to go into Eve until Eve was perfectly
filled wid the Holy Ghost.  See?  Cause she had the devil in huh.
You see?  Yeah, she h ad the devil in huh.  If she didn't have the
devil in huh, she wouldn't been caught so quick when the Serpent come
an talk to huh.  You're not so quick to fall, you know, if you're on
a good prop.  You understan me?  Thass right.
     I don't think nothin of no woman tellin huh husband
what no man done ast huh.  If you ain't gon do it, you ain't gon do it
nohow.  That show you don't want that man, you understand.  You wanna
git rid of him.  Tellin him what some man said to you.  H e might
try to kill the man.  Or might mess round an make the man kill him,
either.  If he killed the man, you got rid of him.  If the man killed
him, you got rid of him.  If you ain't gon do a thang, you jes ain't
gon do it.  Man is made to ask, and woman is made to deny if she want
to.  Why should you git mad at a man fur askin you fur what he want?
You don't have to give it.  Now, I don't want to know what a man ast
you.  I wants to know, Did you do it, so I can kill you.  That's the
thing I want to know.  If you're so quick to tell what a man ast you,
tell me whether you give it to him.  Thass right.
     (Why do feel people care whether their partner
makes love with somebody else or not?)
     Why would I care?. . .Well, I'm mon tell you.  It's a lie
