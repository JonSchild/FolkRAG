24

I fear it will not be,
Then tell them while you preach in word,
They do not care for me.

My children, too, I want them there,
And there I hope they'll be,
And while you preach and praise the Lord,
Tell them to think of me.

Brothers and sisters, we have come,
And His grace we shall see,
It calls the Lord for every one,
Their call will shortly be.

Oh, children, now be looking up,
We know there is a key,
When death is conquered, graves give up,
Our brothers we shall see.

Now dry your tears and cheer up,
And weep no more for me,
When Jesus comes He'll take us home,
No weeping there will be.

There we shall meet and praise the Lord,
His face we all shall see,
And shout and sing forever more,
Through all eternity.

MY OLD COTTAGE HOME

I am thinking tonight of my old cottage home,
That stands on the brow of the hill,
Where in life's early morn, I once loved to roam,
But now all is quiet and still.

CHORUS:

Oh, my old cottage home,
That stands on the brow of the hill,
