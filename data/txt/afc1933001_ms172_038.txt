Dear Mr. Fisher,
     Enclosed you will find an outline of my program
for Mexico City, and the full text of my remarks.
I wish you would have this last translated into
Spanish and mailed to me as soon as it is finished
so that I may rehearse it in that language.
     I notice that your letter did not mention
Joshua White. Please assure me in your next that he
will be included in the party flying to Mexico.
     I must insist that you arrange for an advance
on my fee to help me take care of my expenses on
the trip. I presume that I shall see you and I 
hope so.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
