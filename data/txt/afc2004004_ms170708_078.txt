8.
As I walked over London Bridge,
One midsummer's morning early,
And there I beheld a fair lady,
Lamentin' for her Georgie.

I pray can you send me a little boy
Who can go an errand swiftly,
Who can go ten miles in one hour
With a letter for a lady.

So come saddle me my best black horse,
Come saddle it quite swiftly,
So I may ride to the king's castle goal
An' beg for the life of me Georgie.

So when she got to the castle door
The prisoners stood many,
They all stood around with their caps in their hands
Exceptin' her bonny, bonny Georgie.

Now me Georgie never done. . .
I'm wrong.  .That's right.
My Georgie never stole neither horse nor cow,
Now done any harm to any.
He stole sixteen of the king's fat deers
Which grieved me most of any.
