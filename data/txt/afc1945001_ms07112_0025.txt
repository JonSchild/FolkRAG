"There is no real war production in Topeka. You can thank the
Chamber of Commerce for that.  They fought it for too long.  However, 
the politicians around here also did everything they could to keep
war production out of here. Now they want it, and it is might hard
to get.  So, all the good men are going some place else.  They are
making an effort now to get a plant here, and they might get one. 
However, they are starting rather late." [*Topeka, Kan. 8-5 58*]
