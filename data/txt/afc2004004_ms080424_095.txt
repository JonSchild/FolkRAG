Stan in his workshop

(Stan) I build you one, and it's not right, I don't let you have it.
So, I lay this (unint) down, and I build the dulcimers. So, I'll show
you a little bit about the dulcimers.

AL: First tell us what the dulcimer is, where it comes from.

Stan: The dulcimer comes from England, the pattern comes from England.
My great-grandpa brought it from there. The banjo was made in this
country, but the dulcimers really come from England. The first dulcimers,
I mean the first piece of music that was played in a church was a dulcimer,
but I guess it would have been a hammered one. I think the
hammered dulcimer is much older than this. So I lay this down here, and
show you how it goes together. I'll show you how you start. That's the
bottom part, ...and right here is a hoop(?), some of 'em calls it a
"hoops"(?)...

AL: You have to bend that wood.

Stan: No, we used to bend it, but I saw it out like this now, we used
to bend 'em. And the dulcimer (unint.) has bent hooks (?) in it.

AL: What kind of wood is that?

Stan: This is sycamore here, I mean mulberry...(technical).....

AL: Start again....

Stan: This is the bottom of a dulcimer here, this is the bottom pattern,
so that's where you start it. I lay it down here, you know, and right
in here is the hooks -- some of 'em call it the ribs(?), I call it the
hooks. This is where it goes. You lay it down there, but you have to
have the glue and stuff. And here is the other one. You put it down
here like this. So it's just that part there that has to be fixed.
And this is the top part here that you're lookin' at. That goes on
there, these harps(?) have to be cut out. This goes on like this.
