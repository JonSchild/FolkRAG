Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City
Dear Mr. Lomax:
   Am I correct in assuming that "pulling
a doey" is the equivalent of making
a scene?  Please tell me also if a
"Harrison special" is a revolver or something
else.
   I am still playing those records to
everybody and even went so far as to play
the "Boll Weevil songs" and the
Blues" to the Round Table.  The reactions
were interesting.  By the way I never
thanked the Musicraft Company for these
records because I did know to whom to
write.  Do they represent a gift from the
company or from you?
Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
