When, in spite of this general program, analysis of
rumors reveals information gaps, special material covering the 
specific subjects should be publicized as soon as possible. 
Campaigns blanketing local topics must be developed locally. 
Material to cover national questions will be sent to the project 
director by the Bureau of Intelligence when analysis demonstrates 
it is needed. Feature articles, radio talks and speeches before 
groups among whom the rumors are current should be arranged. 
This should be done without referring the the rumors which pre-
cipitated the campaign.

It must be remembered that one of the important jobs 
of a rumor-control project is to locate weak spots in the community 
war effort. Where [a lot of] many rumors report bad housing conditions, 
it might be wisest to try to improve the housing conditions. This 
could be done by conferring with proper housing authorities. 
Then as part of the educational program, with approval of the 
housing authorities, it might be advisable to give publicity to 
the housing shortage to encourage people to open their homes 
to roomers.

In any case, it must be remembered that rumors are 
perfectly natural phenomena and no rumor-control project can 
expect to eliminate them entirely. 

The general information aspects of a rumor control 
project are the major and continuing part of its educational 
work. However, in some cases it may be desirable to try direct 
attacks upon local rumors.
