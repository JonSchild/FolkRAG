day or evening? I would rather like to keep my hand in and I believe
I could give you a good show with a lot of entertainment and educational
value to reach a good many people.

I am sorry we didn't get a chance to talk these things over while you 
were here but I would be glad to come to New York to discuss either one
or both if you think it worth-while.

Best regards from Elizabeth and myself to Elizabeth and yourself.

Sincerely,

Alan
