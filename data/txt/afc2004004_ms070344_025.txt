- Yesterday, the 21st was the first days
of typical Irish weather - rain &
mist.  On that day, of course, we
drove all day through the countryside
-occasional green glimpses of it thru
the fog & rain - a dull landscape
on the whole rich Englished
middle of the country.  [?] product
seemed to be Guinness, that was
wheat the trucks were loaded with - 

Cashel Castle - grey ruin on a
grey cliff over a grey river - but
noble - You could hear the thin horns
of the hunting Lords - the screams
of tortured peasants - see the gay
bloody banners in the wind - it
was built by the Normans or an ancient
rite & became the seat of the king's
of Ireland - taken & burned
by Cromwell - it now holds its
jagged grey bones up to the
sky - the rain flows
