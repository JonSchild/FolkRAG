This gentleman['s] was name was Porter King, as I before stated. 
And, of course, he seemed to have a kind of yen for my style of 
playing, although we had two different style[d]s playing. And 
of course, he particularly liked this style of number that I was 
playing and that was the reason that I named it after him, 
but not Porter King- I changed the name backwards and named 
it King Porter Stomp.
   
And this tune become to be the [greatest] outstanding 
favorite of every great hot band throughout the world, that had 
the accomplishments and the qualifications [to] of playing it and, 
until today, this tune has been the cause of many a great 
band to come to fame. It has caused the outstanding tunes 
today to use the backgrounds that belonged to King Porter 
in order to make great tunes of themselves. This tune was 
wrote the same year as Alabama Bound in 1905. It was wrote 
the same time [as] with another tune that I wrote.
   
Of course, I never got any credit for it. Mr. Williams, 
[Mr.] Clarence Williams got the credit for it. It was You Can 
Have It, I Don't Want It. Well, it went something like this: 
There was no words, it was [just] a lot of foolish words to it.

                    You can have it, I don't want it,
                    Papa, Lawd God, take it from me,
                    Papa, Lawd God, take it from me,
                    Papa, Lawd God, take it from me,
                    [Oh, take it from me] You can have it, I don't want it,
                    That'[i]s the thing I say,
                    Oh, my baby, yes, baby,
                    You can have it from me.
