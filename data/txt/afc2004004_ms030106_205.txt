Every time you see a man coming down the street
He won't stop, he'll pass her door, babe,
Tricks ain't walking no more
She can't get a dime, that poor whore,
I never seen things so tight before
Because etc ..
I mean it .......
That's the thing that Kid North used to do. He played a little
piano and he had a kinda little house there. He was a single fellow
and he kept this house mostly to have the girls until he got married
to a beautiful girl named Helen. He particular named this place the
Lion's Jaw - "When they go into the lion's jaw, they clinched." Says,
"I never let em get away." He's a funny sort of a guy. He always
made a lotta money and he was a swell dresser - very tight across the
chest. He wouldn't give a dollar and a half for a diamond as big as
anybody's heat - that was one of his words that he would say all the
time. At that he was a swell guy - he finally went with Bob Rowe and
coupled up with him in the race track business. He never spent a dime on
those horses - It was all Bob Rowe's money, but Bob always wanted somebody
to be with him because Bob was kinda sickly and, of course, the Kid
had the big front as the owner.
     At one time Bob had a fine horse that really made him - in fact,
he was a dead horse when Bob bought him - he paid about $300 for him -
the horse, Crowfield made an awful lot of money for him. But, anyhow
Kid was a smart fellow and he was instrumental in some parts of this
tune - Someday Sweetheart. And I was the one to play the tune around.
     Of course, my name doesn't appear on the tune. I'm not jealous
about it. I hope the boys write 10 million other ones like that, but,
since it happens to be a thing like the Archives that you supposed to
give facts, I think the facts is something that really should come out.
They (Spikes) wrote up the tune together and called it "Someday Sweetheart"
but they left my name off of it, which I was really the cause of the tune
