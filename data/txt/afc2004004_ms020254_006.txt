Sister Mary, you come down, 
Down to the mire, come on down,
Down to the mire , come on down,
Down to the mire, [Lord, Lord-a] lower, lower,
The the mire, [Lord] lower, I told ya,
To the mire, [Lord] lower, chile,
In the mire, when you bow,
In the mire, [Lord] low, chile,
In the mire, Jesus'll meet you,
In the mire, low, low,
In the mire, low is the way,
In the mire when you bow,
In the mire, then you rise
From the mire, higher and higher,
In the mire, higher and higher,  (2)
In the mire, when you 'rose
From the mire, soul converted,
In the mire, feel all right,
From the mire, you shout around,
In the mire, shout, shout.  (3)
In the mire, Brother Thomas,
In the mire you come down, 
To the mire, lower and lower,
