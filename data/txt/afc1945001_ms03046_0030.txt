Policeman  

Place or circumstances in which rumor passed:  On police beat

Description of the person:  Did not have a regular beat but  in the course of his
visits over the city, gave especial attention to
listening for rumors.

Rumor: The father of a son in the Army was telling this story:  "My son was injured
in battle in Wake Island and received a broken back. My wife just returned
from the Naval Base hospital in San Diego, and said that what she saw was
very discouraging. There were 4000 in the hospital; one wing was devoted 
entirely to shell-shocked maniacs who had to be shut up in casket-like boxes
every night. My wife has just received notice from the hospital to return
and get our son, and he is to receive $66.00 a month the balance of his
life for this broken back that he received in service.
