Como, Miss.
Dear Felix,
Enclosed is a letter of contract which will
permit me to publish the song you recorded for me this
last summer. Please sign two copies and return to me
straightway so that this record can get right out. I
will then advance you $15 cash, and you will receive
cash royalties when the records are published next
spring.
All best wishes, 
Alan Lomax.
