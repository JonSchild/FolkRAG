Bill Martin was an' awful good gambler --- a good coon-can player
an' dealer of monte ---- he sit down after the judge tole him--give him
life time--  he lost his hand ----

Bill Martin sat down to play coon-can,
Po' boy couldn' half play his hand.

[Bill Martin sat down to play coon can]
Thinkin' bout the woman that he murdered,
[Poor boy couldn't half play his hand] 
Had Gone away to some far, distant land.

They taken Bill Martin out de jail to the freight depot --- where they gonna [brin]
bring his po' wife's dead body by ---- so he could look at her ----
see what a low-down deed he had done -----
They taken Bill Martin to the freight depot,
The train come on easin' by,
Waved his hand at the women that he murdered,
Po' boy hung down his head an' he cry.

"She's gone, she's gone, she's gone,
An' cryin' won' bring her back.
She's the onlies' woman that I ever loved,
She's gone down some lonesome railroad track."

They all went home an' reragged in red,
The wimmen all heard that Ella Speed was dead,
They all went home an' they reragged in red.

They taken Ella Speed to the buryin' ground,
They was all singing wid a doneful sound,
