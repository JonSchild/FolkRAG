Roll 20    Cass Wallin     p. 1
AL:   Mr. Wallin!
Cass:   Hey there!
AL:   How are ya?
Cass:   Oh I'm feeling fine today!
AL:   Well I heard you know a lot of these old time ballads
and things, like that. . . . 
Cass:   I've sung 'em all my life.
AL:   Well, why is it that so many people deny they know
them and all that, they think they're "devil songs" and
so forth. . .
Cass:   Well, some of them does, you know, a lot of Christian
people don't believe in these love (unint) songs.
AL:   What is it (unint) love songs?
Cass:  Well, way back, you know when they first came into
this country, about 25 years -- bout as old as I am now --
they didn't have banjos and pianos or anything in the
Church.   They thought meant, all tended to what people got
killed among one thing and the other.  They made up on (??)
maybe Shelton Long and havethese banjo pickin's and have
a frolic and some of them get killed.
AL:   Ah-ha.   That's because, I saw sometimes they had a bottle
or so. . . love-juice you make up here in the mountains.
Cass:   Oh yes, yes it was, that love-joice will make everybody
rich and got no kinfolk!
