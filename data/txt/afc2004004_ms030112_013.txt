GD:    The scriptures say "He that thinketh in his heart
so is he."

LJ:      I live by that.

GD:    Only way you know a person, is by knowing yourself.
If you meet me, or any man out there, and You say
well that man you ain't nothing to him.  Well [you]
he ain't nothing to you, because you ain't nothing
to yourself.  They ain't nothing to you. I
mean you know so much whats good for the other fella.
You see whats in the other fella by whats in you.
You [know] see what I'm talkin about.

LJ:      THAts right.

GD:     If somebody say You ain't nothing, they oughta
know you cause they ain't nothing.
If the devil in you, you gonna see nothing but the
devil in somebody else. Because its in you.
You understand. If [there's] anything good in you,
you'll see good in somebody else. You see, just
whats in you.

LJ:      Right.

GD:     Hear what I say? You can't get out of that state of mind.
If your a rogue you understand, you see another one.

LJ:       Right.

GD: You understand.  If you're a robber, you see it in
somebody else.  How come you see it in somebody
else, cause you are one.
