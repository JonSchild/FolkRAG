Americans are starving

A solder of the Reich is
reporting to the Gastapo. He
says with great jot My Frueheur
 I have good news
to report to you.  The americans 
are starving.  The Frueheur 
immediately ask have 
you proof of this.  Oh, yes came
the reply, everytime they
meet each other on the
street they ask "What's cooking"?

What did one rat say to the 
other rat -- Heil Hitler - our
