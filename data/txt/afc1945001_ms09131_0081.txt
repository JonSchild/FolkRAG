A soldier had a two day leave and
 decided to get married. Upon returning to the 
hotel after the ceremony, he sat and look out 
of the window. The bride finally asked him
what he was watching. He replied that
his mother had told him that the night 
he got married would  be the most wonderful
he had ever seen and he didn't want to miss
any of it.
