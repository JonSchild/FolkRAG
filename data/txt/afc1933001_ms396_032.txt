no fear of the yap-yap-yap-yapping of a coyote,the scream of a Mexican lion or any of the sudden noises of the night. So they were soothed to sleep and soothed after they were asleep by what the cowboys called "dogiesonggs". Never a rain storm at night but that the entire band of cowboys were rousted from their beds to "talk" to their cattle, and their singing and yodeling helped to stop many a stampede.
When the cowboys had sung to them all the songs that they know,they made up songs about cowboy life:
early in the morning we round up the dogies,
Mark them and brand them and bob off their tails;
Drive up the horses,load up the mess wagon,
And throw them dogies up on the trail.
Whoopee-ti-yi-yo,git along,little dogies.
A blinding flash of lightning or a sudden clap of thunder,the sharp yap of a coyote, the shrieking whine of a panther, even the "whop" of a quirt on the leather leggings of a cowboy might send a herd of thousands of longho rns stampeding through the dark-ness scattering widely over the prairies or plunging over precipes, to be maimed or some-times crushed to death. Ed Nichols once showed me a bluff where in a stampede he had seen a hundred steers crushed to death from leaping over the cliffs of Steele's Creek, killed on the rocks a hundred feet below. Another cowboy recalled that crazed fright had driven a fleeing herd across a deep gorge where
"Those behind said forward,and those in front said back.", withtthe result that the entire herd went on over,filling the gorge level full of struggling bodies,so that the tail end of the maddened herd plunged across and over on the helple s bodies of their trampled and disabled comrades.
So,singing to the slumbering cattle has a most practical value. As a child I,of course,did not know all this, though,as it seems to me now,I did feel the weird-like beauty of the cowboy songs of the Texas frontier,sifted to me through the night. At least I was proud to remember the words, and one of my early tasks in penmanship was to set them down in verse form. All these scraps I put away.
