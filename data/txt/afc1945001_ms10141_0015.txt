Sophomore White Female

1. In a certain army camp, when they are on
long marches, they have to sing Twidaloo-
Twill Over the Hill.
I hear the boys can't stand that song.

2. A Chicago paper ran an add offering $10000
to someone who had seen or found a
clothing rationing book. No one showed up.
In about two or three days they ran
an add saying that if any one said they
had heard of a woman who sent to Washington
for a food ration book and they
sent a clothing rationing book instead;
for them to ignore them, they were liar.
