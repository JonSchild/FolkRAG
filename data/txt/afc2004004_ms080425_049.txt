Tape:  #222   SACRED HARP    1

Man:    It's a wonderful feeling.   . . . . . . . . . .
You won't go to another singing as good as this on this
earth.   There won't be none no better than this.   It's the
best you'll get.

AL:    You gotta go to heaven.

Man:    THat's right, you gotta be singing in Heaven, it'd be
the next best thing.

AL:    The acoustics in this place are especially good in here
aren't they?   The sound of the church.

Man:    You get a good rebound, it's not a dead bunk, it's got
a bounce to it.   You ain't got a lot of dead space up
overhead to absorb the sound and it goes up and--what we
call a rebound.

AL:    You got a rebound crowd, too, don't you?.

Man:   Yeah, a rebound crowd.   When you get a crowd like that,
there ain't no way you can keep them from singing.   And you
can't have a bad sing in here, we just don't have them.

AL:   We'll see you in the nextcouple of days.

McGraw:    Marie, How long you been singing?

Marie:    All my life.

Hugh:    You won't say how long that is.

Marie:    I don't care.   I'm 65 years old.   Proud of living
that long.

Hugh:    Now, your brothers and sisters, mother and father,
