Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have your letter of July 3, and can begin work as 
soon as you send me a machine.

Never having done any collecting on a full-time basis, 
it is difficult for me to estimate the expenses.  I don't 
expect to make any money out of this business, and will do 
my best with whatever sum you are accustomed to grant 
collectors.

The Ozark collection will run to more than 1000 items - - 
perhaps 1500.  I don't think I can do the job properly in 
less than six months.

Naturally I'd like to have my name mentioned in 
connection with this collection, but the matter of "scholarly 
restrictions" is not very important to me.  I am quite willing 
to turn the records over to the Archive - - or to you personally - - 
without any restrictions at all.

Sincerely yours,

Vance Randolph
