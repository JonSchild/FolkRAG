TAPE:  Roll R-4, Appalachia  9

AL:   I was asking why women drink less than men, but you say
thay they drink as much, maybe.

Ray:   Well, I'd say some of the mountain women, they didn't get 
out and cavort as much as the men, but hell, they drank about
as much as a man, those old time mountain women.  They worked
if off.  See, a lot of people don't know, the women done more
work than man. . . . yeah, that housework, man, it's something
else and when a mountain woman puts on breakfast, they put
on dinner right then, and that dinner is left simmering all day
long.  When she washed the dinner dishes, she put on supper.  She
cooked all day on the hearth and on a no cook wood stove, you know.
A pot of pinto beans, now they cook 'em in an hour, they used to
cook 'em all day long, didn't they, Caz?  With a hunk of meat in it.

Caz:   It'd simmer.  Had apiece of metal or something across the
chimney, had hooks on it.  Hook that pot on there, cook it slow.

AL:  I guess the liquor helped 'em with pains and aches, too,
didn't it?

Ray:  It helped them with the pains and aches and it helped them
bear the tough living, a little shot of whiskey, you know. . .  it's
actually good for you, Alan, I mean if you can drink it.   I can't
have it, I know that, but if you have a couple of drinks every
day, especially after you reach a certain age, it keeps your
blood down, it's a good medicine.   A doctor don't want you to
drink it, on account of they can't sell you the medicine.
