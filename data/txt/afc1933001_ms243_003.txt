Dear Father:

I have just come back from New York where Bess was installed as secretary and assistant to Carlton Smith, chief of the Music Division of the New York Public Library and this year's commentator on the School of the Air music programs.  Bess, in return for her twenty-five dollars a week, will probably write the scripts for the School of the Air and do most of the research and contact work.

I also called on Fadiman, and he promises to do his best for the book, which will be released on the 28th of October.  Luce I couldn't get to see, but I arranged for Bess to call on him.  She is in a position to do well in a number of directions, I think, and I think you can put your worries at rest for awhile.

Don't get mad at Burl Ives, who plugs your songs over CBS five times a week, but reproach Columbia Recording Company in regard to the Cowboy's Lament, Peter Gray, Cotton Eye Joe, and Darling Corey, which are right out of our books.  Sweet Betsy from Pike is his own.  I didn't give him permission to use the songs, but told him that he should get C.S.C. in touch with you.  Their address is 799 Seventh Ave., N.Y.C.

Send me Shirley's address as soon as you have it.

Much love to you and Deanie,

Alan
