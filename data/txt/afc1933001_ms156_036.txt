Dear Mr. Lomas.
Two years ago I wrote you regarding my daughter's program of Southern songs, and fancifully those of Louisiana, and I made mention of the fact that I had been extremely interested in your article of the Bayou Country and the Cajuns.
I was please to receive an answer to my letter.
Last Fall my daughter, Elizabeth
