     The other day I received a
letter from a soldier in Alabama.
He told me that he took a girl out
Saturday night (his night off). They had
gone to the show and then to dine.
While he was walking home with
her he asked her how old she
was. She replied, "Fourteen years old"
He told me he turned red in the
face. He also told me that if the
girls fourteen years old look like
twenty. Then how do the girls that
are twenty look.
