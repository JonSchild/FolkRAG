He was a millinaire (millionaire), ya know. An' he had to --
this what they did for him: He had three plantations. All right.
An' they say he couldn't be a millinairy -- I don't know how
to say it like this, you know -- he couldn't be a millinairy and
be a doctor and three -- and hold three plantations. So he had
ta -- He couldn't doctor on nobody but his hands. You know, not an'
[to] be known. They stopped him. He's a good one, too. Folks
slipped to 'im, ya know. People just slipped to him to be, to
be doctored on. All his hands, he could doctor all he want to,
but other than that. An' some folks would be sick an' come,
come stay with some of the people. You know, like when my folks was
sick, I let them stay with me. They just git a chance for him,
him to doctor on 'em. He was good. But they, but they say, 
they say it's the Govament or the United States or sumpin' or
other. Anyhow, it was sumpin' like that. He had three plantations. 
An' he's already a millinairy, see? An' he had three
plantations.
AL: What's a millinairy?
BJ: That mean he's a rich man. A millinairy man. A real,
real rich man. All his life, ya see. An' he was raised up
with them colored boys an' men.
AL: Didn't the other white people put him down for bein' so
regular with the colored?
BJ: No-o. They had nothin' to do with it nohow. His son was
practicin' to be a doctor. I suppose he tuk up the doctor
part. But no-o. Everybody had nothin' to do with it...Not to,
not to my knowin'.
