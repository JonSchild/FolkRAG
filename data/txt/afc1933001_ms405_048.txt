ADVENTURES
BLOOMINGTON AND LOS ANGELES

I found many folk songs during my lectures to college students,
but I had other experiences also. One night I lectured before the students
of Denison University in Ohio. At eleven o'clock the next morning
I had engaged to speak at chapel services of the University of Indiana at

lecture agreements, I would apply a ruler to the railroad map and decide
whether I could or could not make the distance required to meet the
next audience. A railroad time-table always confused me. I could never
figure one out. But sometimes my ruler got me into trouble. This was one

My route led from Denison University, about fifty miles east of
Columbus, via the Pennsylvania Railway straight to Indianapolis, where I

ten minutes before my train would reach Indianapolis. That meant the loss
of a hundred dollars lecture fee, as well as the disappointment to friends
who were bringing me to Indiana University for the third time. On account
of bad roads an automobile ride was impossible. I even considered hiring
a special train.
In desperation I told my troubles to a new conductor who had taken
charge of the train at Columbus. He most kindly agreed to wire the train
