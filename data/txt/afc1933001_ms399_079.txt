Country Brags

Raised on six-shooter till I got big enough
to eat ground shot-guns

The moans of widows and orphans in
music to me melancholy soul

Born in the Rocky Mountains, suckled by an 
grizzly bear,
Ninety-nine rows of jaw teeth and not
a single hair

Thirty-two inches between the eyes and they 
feed me with a shovel

Mount the wild ass and jump from crag & ^ crag

Shoulder 500 bushel of shot and walk through solid
rock up to my knees.

Any man don't believe it I'll lick him on a
sheep hide and never tromp ^tromp over the tail

I'll snatch him bald-headed and spit on the
place where the hair come off

Take a leg off and beat him with bloody
end of it

Slaps ^slap his head up to peak and then knock the
peak off.

Over Take his eye out and eat it -- for a grape.
