Fisk, 22. 3.
That's the way [to] rock. I done forgot there - I can't rock. (laughter)
Shouting.
W: - happy & shout
A: And what does it mean, to shout? Does that mean to yell and make a lot of noise[?] with your mouth.
W: [Yessir. It's] If that's the way the Spirit [moves] leads you. If the Spirit [moves] leads you to holler, you holler. And if the Spirit moves you to [tap] pat your feet or [pat] wring your hands, you do that. [A Spirit] Your soul's happy. It mean you get a feeling just comes to you now and then and [get fired up and] when you get kinda in spirit from talking with the Lord, and [the Spirit] that feeling comes[.] to you just now and then. [Lot of them] And you really got to do something. You've got to [tap] pat your feet or pat your hands or [rock] wring your hands or cry. If you don't that, you've [either] got to holler. Because, [they say] you see, you can't hold it.
A: Did you ever see anybody walk the benches, Arnie?
W: Walk the benches? I seen folks fall over the benches (laughter). [They'd just] Just start across on their feet & fall across and step across they're so happy. [They] They say they happy.
A: Do you think folks put it on [about] being happy?
W: Oh well now, I [couldn't say] don't know about the putting on. Heap of folks put on, of course. [I know some folks] Some of um shout from their hearts, but I couldn't say that they put it on. I couldn't say [they give up] that they wasn't[.] [See] because they could say the same thing about me when I gets that-a-way. See. They could say I was [feeling] foolish, but I don't never get foolish. Everybody's [that stand on the other leg would say everybody stand on the lecture leg.] spirit don't do alike. Everybody's spirit don't act alike. (to group of children [?] are near) [I'm talking] Us about the old folks. [I don't have any truck] Us ain't talking with [the] no young folks (laughter). [I know] Us asking the old folks they know - you'all come here talking about [the other folks] us. [You be talking about us, and we ain't old] Don't you'all come here. Don't you all come here because you  don't know nobody to talk about but us, and we ain't old (lots laughter).
A: Well, [let's go] you'al can come back and sing some ring songs.
W: You all come back and sing some [sing things] [?] -- do you know any ring songs? See more Elies & things?
