weavers in the village.  Mary G's mother was a weaver.  4 looms in this glen + they all got their share of the work.

The time I'm talking of 50 years ago -- 4 looms might be
going with 4 [?] for 4 dif
people+ there might be keen
competition going as to who
would finish first + get the 
first waulking.

Well, then in this one village
at one time or another every
household wd have had a
waulking + a woman was judged
on how well her menfolk were turned
out with nice homemade tweeds. 
If she were a good housewife he
would have fine tweeds, if she
were poor, her man wd be 
clad in rags.
