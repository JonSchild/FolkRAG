Johnny O' Breadislee;
1) Johnny rose on a May morning
Called for water to wash his hands.
And he called for his twa grey hounds
To be bound in iron chains, chains,
To be bound in iron chains.

2) Johnny shot the dun deer lap
She was wounded in the side.
And between the waters and the woods
They greyhounds laid her pride. (2)

3) Now Johnny ate o' the venison
And the dogs drank I' the bleed,
And they all lay doon and fell asleep,
Asleep as though they'd been dead.

4) And by there came a silly old man,
And a silly old man was he,
And he's awa' to the king's forester
for to tell on young Johnny.

The Hearst's o' Retty:
1) I hae seen the hairst o' Rettie and twa-three on the thronw,
I've heard for six and seven weeks the hairsters girn and groan.
But a covie Willie Rae, in a monthie and a day,
Mak's the jolly hairster lads gae singing doon the brae.

2) A monthie and a day, my lads, the like was never seen,
It beats to sticks the fastest strips o' Victory's new machine.
A Speedwell now brings up the rear, a Victory clears the way,
And twenty acres daily yields, nor stands to Willie Rae.

3) He drives them roun' androun' the fields at sic an awful rate,
He steers them canny out and in at mony'sthe kittle gate;
And wiles them safely owre the clods to mony's the hidden hole,
But he comes by no mischanter if you leave him wi' the pole.

4) He sharps their teeth to gar them bite, then taps them on the jaws
And when he finds them dully like, he brawly kens the cause.
A boltie here, a pinnie there, a little out o' tune,
He shortly stops their wild career and brings the slushet doon.

5) He whittles of at corners, makes crookit bitties straight,
And sees that man and beast alike are equal in the draught.
And all the sheavies lyin' straight, and nane o' them agley,
For he'll count wi' only dominie frae the Deveron to the Spey.
