WHEN THE YANKS GO MARCHING IN 
Dictate

It's when the yanks go marching in
When the yanks go marching in
Yes boys, I want to be in that number
When the yanks go marching in.

When the guns and cannons roar
When the guns and cannons roar
Hey boys, I want to be in that number,
When the guns and cannons roar.

When our planes shall win the sky
When our planes shall win the sky
Yes boys, I want to be in that number, 
When our planes shall win the sky.

When that Nazi flag goes down
When that Nazi flag goes down
That's when I want to be in that number
When that Nazi flag goes down.

Where free men fight for their rights
Where free men fight for their rights
Say boy, I want to be in that number,
Where free men fight for their rights.

When the yanks go marching in 
When the yanks go marching in 
Everybody, I want to be in that number, 
When the yanks go marching in.
