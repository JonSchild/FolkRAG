Hon. Archibald MacLeish,
Director,
Office of Facts and Figures,
Washington, D.C.

My dear Mr. MacLeish:

In reply to your letter of February 23 regarding Rumor 
Clinics, may I point out that there is some misunderstanding in 
the minds of the members of your Board for no plan has been set 
up to promote discussion of rumors locally analyzed. Thus far, 
the general plan jointly worked out by representatives from your 
office, Col. Donovan's office, and my office, has been critically 
discussed with a number of experts in the colleges. Some groups 
in various parts of the country have begun experimenting with it 
but nothing official has been started by our office. 

The practical question is whether or not the three 
offices can cooperatively tap the intellectual leadership in certain 
of the colleges for the purpose of rumor analysis and in 
turn service these institutions with authoritative reports on 
the genealogy and significance of certain rumors. Whether we 
desire it or not many local groups will go into rumor analysis 
on their own responsibility. There is of course the danger that 
these groups may do more harm than good. My own judgement is 
that if adequate leadership and research facilities are available 
in Washington, an organized plan of operation with a number 
of responsible institutions could result in a successful program 
along the lines outlined for the Rumor Clinics.

For the present I suggest that the matter be held in 
abeyance as it does not appear that the three offices are quite 
prepared to provide the necessary leadership and technical facilities 
needed to assure the success of the project.
Very cordially yours,                                                                       
J. W. Studebaker
Commissioner.
