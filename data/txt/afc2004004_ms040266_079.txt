Dear Mr. Lomax,

    Some months ago I telephoned you at your hotel; you invited
me to "drop a card." I am abusing the in invitation by dropping you a letter
although I realise that you are very busy; therefore, I do not expect any
other reply than a postcard. May I remind you of the phone conversation?
     I introduced myself as a collector of ?Conyven? recordings. I
also mentioned that I was a beginner and not an authority on
Folk song. May I be allowed to write of my collection and my aims?
       With a friend, a friend deeply interested in the problems of colored
people -- I began to read about the American Negro. We  both collected
 jazz records,songs and blues of Bessie Smith, headbelly and other Negroe
singers.We then discovered books written by you, and borrowed them
from the American Embassy.Later, I wrote to Washington, on a 
"scrounge" and later reviewed fourteen Library of Congress Albums,
(now held at the embassy) which I recorded onto tape. This small
collection is made up of Negro songs and White Ballads and
songs.
  We are both familiar with many of the Child Ballads, and
after reading Cecil Sharp, decided that there was still a source
of folk-song in the British Isles. I thought that with the aid of
my tape recorder and with the 1910 Sharp as a guide we might
look for singers. I, being the technical brain decided that
tape was unsuitable,( an idea later  dismissed by you over the phone)
and the idea peters out.
     I sought the aid of the "English Folk Song and Dance
Society"; and  received by return post  a circular asking
