Mr. E. E. Moss, Manager
Clemens State Farm
Brazoria, Texas

Dear Mr. Moss:

Some time ago I wrote you inquiring the where abouts of one
Smith Cason. You told me that you did not know the man, and
I wrote back that his possible alias was Roger Gill. I also
told you that he had played on the program entitled "Behind
the Walls" on numbrous occassions, and I hope that one or the 
other of these two ideas will help you locate the man. I
would greatly appreciate some answer to this inquiry at you
earliest possible convenience. I have got to find out one way
or another whether he is locatable.

Thanking you in advance, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
