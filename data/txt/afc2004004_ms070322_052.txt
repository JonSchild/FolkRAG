Monday - bank holliday #
March 26th - Hamstead 
Hamish Henderson & Isla Cameron
came for breakfast yesterday. It's still
clear that people are difficult for
me, especially if Robin is estranged.
She was somewhat yesterday morning
because I had plead, wept & forced
her to let me make love. So 
at breakfast I dropped the frankfurters
in the wastebasket, spilled water on the
table, bumped into Robin's buttered
toast & buttered my thumb and ended
by asking was tartan [dyd] dyed before 
it was woven or after. This naturally 
provoked a snort of laughter, then embarrassed 
silence & I felt terribly 
stupid before Robin - as I remember having
felt a 1000 time before in groups of people
in classrooms, etc.
