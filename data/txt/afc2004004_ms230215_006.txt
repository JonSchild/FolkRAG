You had to get old George
about 3 pts lit - he wdn't
be no good else -
So we asked him for his
favorite tune & it was
"Hark [the] my soul it is 
the Lord" and his wife
was there & she was against
the drink. So he said
all right & he bgin to
play away & his wife went
fr him "that is blasphemy
George, blasphemy !" And
she marched out of the hall.
So old George was in disgrace
And he went home & he 
always played all the way
home - give the old folks a
tune - So he found the door locked
& he played "I'm Nobody's
Darling."
