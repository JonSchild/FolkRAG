Mousillini, Stalin, Hitler, and Roosevelt got together
because they were tired of the war. They
thought maybe they could settle it peacefully. Now
the big question seemed to be who would rule
or have the main control over the world. Mousillin
thought he should because he thought he had
done a lot [if starting during?] when he went into
Ethiopia, Stalin, thought he should because his 
land was so large his government was popular
and he had a lot of man power. But Hilter
spoke up and thought he should because God
had told him he should. Quickly, Roosevelt 
replied "Oh no I didn't."
