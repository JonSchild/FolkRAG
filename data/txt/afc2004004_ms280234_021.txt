3) But this fair and fickle young thing, she didn't know what to say,
Her eyes they shone like silver bright and merrily did play.
Says she, "Young man, your love shall stand, for I'm not ready now,
I'll bide another season at the foot of the sweet brown knowe.

4) Then says he, "My pretty fair maid, how can you answer so?
Look down in yonder valley where my verdant crops do grow.
Look down in yonder valley at me horses and me plough,
For they're at their daily labour for the lass of the . . . . .

5) "If they're at their daily labour, kind sir, it's not for me,
For I've heard of your behaviour, I have indeed," said she.
There is an inn nearby and I hear the neighbours say,
That you tap and call and you pay for all and come home at the break of day."

6) "Well, if I tap and call and pay for all, me money it is my own,
I haven't spent none of your fortune, for I hear you have got none.
You thought you had me poor heart broke while talking to me now,
But I'll just leave ye where I found ye, at the foot of the sweet brown knowe."

Lover's Death:
1) I sat within the valley green and there with my true love,
My fond heart chose the two between, the old love and the new love.
The old for her and the new,
It made me think on old Ireland dearly,
While soft the wind blew down the glen,
And shook the golden barley.

2) While sad I kissed away her tears, my arms about her flinging,
A fool-man's shot burst in my ear from out the wild woods ringing.
The bullet it pierced my true love's side, in her life's young spring so early,
And there upon my breast she died, while the soft winds shook the barley.
