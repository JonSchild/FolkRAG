MOLDENHAUER, NORMA    [*A*]

Pay your taxes and smash the axis 
Two Japanese military leaders were 
talking over the situation of American 
morale and they were very happy 
because it seemed one of them had 
heard that the American people were 
starving so that they have to eat dog 
meat. He said that we actually ate 
hot dogs.
