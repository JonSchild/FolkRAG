[*COMING TOGETHER
OF
ALL THE STRAINS
OF 
BRITISH CULTURE*]

in each one of the [ONE] [*COVES*]  that hadn't
been touched, therewas still a refuge for
the original pristine culture, and now there 
was a new interest in it - from college people,
from, from the ah, ah country music people,
from outsiders in the culture.  People were
coming back from the, from Detroit and Chicago
and settling down to live there, picking up 
the dances again, and finding they were better
than the dances they had learned in town.
Going back to their grandparents and learning
how to fiddle again.  All these things were 
beginning to happen and there were plenty of
sources for that.  So that this culture was
being able to renew itself from its own roots. 
And this is very good news for all of us. 
I think also for people in Britain, because
after all this is an outcome of, of ah, 
British culture.  What really happened in
Ulster, what really happened in, in ah, in
the, the southern backwoods and in the mountains
was a, a coming together of all the
strains of British culture from all the zones
of Britain.
