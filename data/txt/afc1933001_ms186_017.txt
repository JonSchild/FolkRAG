Dear Mr. Archibald:

I have just returned from a field trip
and am interested to find your letters in regard
to "Lady Isabel" and "The wife of Usher's 
well". My secretary is attaching some additional
versions that I have found and I shall
write to the people who have restricted the
versions we are not able to furnish you, for
their permission. When these letters have
been answered, I shall send you an estimate
for the additional records and you can order
the whole group at one time if you care to do
so.

Sincerely yours,
