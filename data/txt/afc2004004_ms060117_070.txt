Dear Alan: 
I am hopeful that 
by now you have received 
the films.  Contrary 
to your charge, I 
did fly out the parcel 
to this address you gave 
me as early as I could. 
Don't see how you are 
going to justify your attack 
on me. 
I am going ahead 
with the Index Cards as 
you instructed. The 
translation has begun 
(Creole). I have not as 

yet been seconded -- 
I am proceeding with 
the work to finish by 
the time you return on 
Aug. [31st] 18th. I appreciate 
the need to be economical 
and I'm acting accordingly.
I have begun to hand 
out the contracts. 
Secondment or no 
secondment the work 
will go on. 
Re Mahoney(?) I will 
see that he gets in and 
do what he promised. 
Regards to TONI. All 
the best, 
JD
