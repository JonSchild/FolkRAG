CHORUS: 
Well, you oughta get tired sometime,
Sometime, sometime, 
Yes, you oughta get tired sometime, 
Scandalizin' my name.

Yes, you oughta get tired sometime, 
An' give God your glory,
Hallelu, 
You oughta get tired sometime, 
Lawd, scandalizin' my name.

I met my sister this mornin',
I shake her righteous hand, 
And before the day was gone, Lawd,
She was scandalizin' my name.                   (CHORUS)

I met my brother this mornin', etc.              (CHORUS)
