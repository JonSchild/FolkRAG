        But it is dangerous to emphasize unduly the role of
enemy propaganda in rumors. This may heighten public uneasiness
about the enemy--making people think that the enemy is so subtle

his propaganda. It may also encourage people to listen to Axis
shortwave, under the delusion that "a lot of other people must be
listening to enemy propaganda if all these rumors are Axis-

        Some rumors are made in Germany or Japan or Italy; most
rumors spring up at home and spread at home. It is better to indicate 
that certain rumors play into the hands of the enemy instead
of suggesting that most rumors are invented and circulated by the
enemy. The rumors which play into the hands of the enemy, and
which are often started by enemy sympathizers or agents, are those
which spread hatred or suspicion among ourselves and which encourage
defeatism or despair.
