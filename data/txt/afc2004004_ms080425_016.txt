ape: Sacred Harp--Exteriors       13
[*217 cont.*]

that was my mother's word for it. That was all going on
in the courts back then, you know.   And I was singing over
there in Edwardsville, you know,     the courthouse is
still there, Senator Hefflin moved it down the street
to Hefflin, Alabama.

AL:   That's a wonderful story.   Thank you very much.   You
raise a lot of garden and stuff, don't you?

Uncle Bob:   Yes, I used to have a section of land up in
western county -- fine   a farm as there was in that part
of the country.   Had eight borders and a brock [*?*]  and I had
hired help, cattle, hogs and I had machinery of all kinds, 
a shop t do my work, a hay baler, a big circle saw that I
cut wood with, took two men to handle the wood you know.
We'd cut it up for use by the people.   And I had a grist
mill to grind corn and like that.  And I grew quite a
lot of cotton at one time-- had as high as 40 barrels of 
cotton at one time.  [*Beg?*] [* ** *] And I grew strawberries by the ton--
tons.  I had about 12 or 15 hands picking strawberries
at times.   I was the first one to put in strawberries
in that section of that country. There wasn't but one more
with strawberries-- married a first cousin of mine.

(Assorted talking, setting up.)

AL:   Let me ask you, do you have a favorite song in the
book?
