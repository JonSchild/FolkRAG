ON DISCS

The spate of American folk and near-folk
material with which the record companies
have been profitably bombarding the public
is no mere product of war hysteria. The
Leadbelly album, for instance, was issued
by Musicraft in May 1939 ($5.50). It is
about the best and most genuine of these.

Best-seller of the lot is Ballad for Americans
made for Victor by Paul Robeson and
the American People's Chorus directed by
the composer Earl Robinson ($2). RCA's
fair booth reports jitterbugs cry for it.

Mr. Robinson has also made an album
of his own Songs for Americans, part of it
genuine folk material, some of it manufactured,
all of it folksy. It is definitely leftish
and the cover of the accompanying leaflet
has four hammers and a sickle-shaped
railroad track. (Timely, $3.50).

Andrew Rowan Summers in Old World
Ballads in America sounds more like a scholar
than a mountaineer. He accompanies himself
- correctly - on a dulcimer (Columbia,
$4.50).

Latest release is Victor's two volumes of
Dust Bowl Ballads by Woody Guthrie
($2.75 each). Guthrie is a genuine Okie,
but his songs are too jaunty for the grim
problems they discuss and for The Grapes of
Wrath, which inspired them. The accompanying
leaflet is brilliant journalism.

Decca's list of American albums is the
longest. Most were made by Frank Luther
and accompanying singers. They vary in
quality from the two excellent albums of
Songs of the Gay 90's to Songs of the Civil
War, which smell more of Broadway than of
the old camp ground ($2.25). The best -
and most genuine - is Cowboy Songs, done
by the Ranch Boys ($2.25).

Large sales of these albums are probably
more indicative of America's cultural coming
of age than of blind patriotism. Carl
Sandburg and Alan Lomax deserve a large
share of credit. - H. W. S.
