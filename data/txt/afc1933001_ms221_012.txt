Dear father:

I've got to get proof that the Darby Ram with
the "Didn't he ramble" refrain is a folk song and not
written. Of course I know that the verse is part of
an old English song but I do not know about the refrain.
Will you look through your files to see what you can
find on this? If you find a version with the given
refrain please mail me the ms air mail, special delivery.
Let me know as soon as you possibly can.

Affectionately,
