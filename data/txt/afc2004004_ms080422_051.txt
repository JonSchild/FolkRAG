Tape: Nimrod Workman #890 cont.
she looked and see'd her children, she prayed the lord to
send them back to her. And she dreamed she seen these
three children coming running down through her hall and she
was happy. And she went to set a table before them, but
they couldn't eat, and then she made this bed for them, with
the best golden sheets and things... that was in her dream. And they
said that cold clay was at their heads, green grass growed
at their feet. And the tears that she shed that night, wet
her winding sheets. Great story of it. 
AL" Dreams are really important in people's loves, aren't
they. Have you done a lot of dreaming yourself?
Nimrod: Yes, I have. I've dreamt dreams and I've dreamt
dreams that have come to pass, have warned me of things...
AL: Do you remember any dreams that you have?
Nimrod: Yeah...
