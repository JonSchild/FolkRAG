OH, MY LIVER AND MY LUNGS

MUSIC--- Oh, My Liver and My Lungs

1 Oh, my liver and my lungs, my lights and my legs, [*26*]
They're paining me, they're paining me;
My heart is sad, my head is bad,
And I think I'm going crazy.

2 Crushed by the days of endless toil
And sleepless nights of woe,

"Bill Keating; I'm thirty; my check's twenty-three;
Mark that down, down, down."

5 I asked them what tools would I need in the place.
"Very few," said the boss with a grin on his face;
"One number six shovel and darn little space,
While you're down, down, down."

6 With a note from the boss to the shaft I made haste,
Saluted the topman, in line took my place;
Sayin', "Gimme a cage, for I've no time to waste,
Let me down, down, down."

7 "All aboard for the bottom!" the topman did yell;
We stepped on the cage, and he gave her the bell;
