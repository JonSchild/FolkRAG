BJ: Well, I'm tryin' to tell ya there's so many diffrunt things
[What] what, ta do, an' ah, there liable to be so much that, [that]
I would like [ta,] ta know about 'em you know, when when, ah, in the case of fixin' 
the medicine for 'em. An' it--But, the main thing is that it
can take ah, plen'y a good, ah, herb medicine, ya know. An', ah,
herb medicine to take for that. Ah, ya know, would be better to
have it mixed. It's, ah, as I say, sa's'p[a]rilla herbs,  ya know;
that's for the blood, ta clean the blood up. An' ah, then ah,
take a lil' [ah, gin] a that ginshank (DOES NOT MEAN "GENTIAN" MAY BE
GINSENG ROOT), jus' a lil' bit a  ginshank with it, ya know? An'
boil it. Ya got sa's'parilla (sarsaparilla), ginshank, an'
sassafak together.

BJ: Yeah, sassafak, um-hum.  Put them three together an' that's
really good, you know, to build 'em up,  for that purpose, in a 
way of speakin', see. 'Cordin', but you never know about gittin'
a chil' [from] for a person 'lessen you definite get in touch in touch
with them an' see how they condition is, ya see? All condition

some [women] jus' ain't never had no chilren, the reason why, an' some jus'
have an achin' in the stomach which is ovary troubles, ya know?
An' all like that. Sometime all that have to be cleaned out an'
done. So I rather, if they would, jus' write me, [an'] then I
know what the trouble is, you see? An I could know what I'm goin'
after. But, because there's so many diffrunt ail[I]ments. Some
got weak kidneys, [has] have to work on that. Ya know? All, jus'
diffrunt things to be done, see? An' so hit'll be good. But,
truly--Ya [see] know, I didn't have no trouble in 21 years, ya [know] see.
