Irish Norse presbyterians didn't
have a knowledge of symphony or
Michelangelo or anything but they
were very very artistically inclined
and they ahd the whole heritage of
Celtic and British tunes in their
head and that was the invisible
baggage that they carried on their
trails up on the mountains, it
didn't weigh a thing, [* ] *] but when they
got to where they were, it made a 
wonderful bower of music for them to
live in.

that we have now realised are
the. . .one of the great human
achievements, they have a lyric
tradition that went back to
Elizabethan and with lyrics that are
quite the equal of the best lyric
poets in Elizabethan days.
