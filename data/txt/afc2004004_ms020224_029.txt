AL:  And you can laugh to say a lot of different things to

AL:  Some laughs are. . .
BJ:  Make up, I call it, pretend.  Lot a people say, "I can look
on 'im an' tell 'e wasn' tickle'."  You know, sometime the people. . .
AL:  What?
BJ:  Sometime people say, "I can look on such-and-such a person
when they laugh and tell he wasn' tickled; he laughed, only he
didn't mean it a bit.  You know, you can look at 'em that way an'
tell,  Sometime you laugh, you jolly all over; you really jolly.
You laugh, you know.  Um, so that's true.  All laughs don't mean
s' (the same) thing.  That's why I say all -- Ev-every thing is, you
know, grin is not, you know, pleasant. . .all the time.  'Cause so
many times you laugh sometimes just to try to get yourself together.
You know, if you're troubled an' feel bad; you try to --
and got to do somethin', you can just laugh it off, you know,
sometimes. . .an'. . .try to git a laugh.  There is a time you got to
laugh to git one.  I think.  That's what I believe.  Everybody
lookin' at you so solemn an' mournfulfied, an' you look like, you,
mighta look like you come to preach they funeral.  Got to get
somethin' or other up an' get 'em movin'.  You know, get 'em with
a diffrunt look on 'em.  Do something funny; laugh yourself.
