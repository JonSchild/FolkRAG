Evictions - notes on Menace of The Nesses
of landlord "There is nothing remarkable in his
history excepting a strange hatred of human
beings as occupiers of his land & an inordinate
 love of sheep & sheep farmers. 

Women meet exciseman in road,
gently take away warrants & burn them
Wonderful scene between beard &
mustachioed excisemen & women who
force them to produce paper. Newspapers
say "They were stripped naked + carried
shoulder high out of the district

If possible copy out some accounts of the beatings
by police - who after drinking to fortify their
spirits - attacked the 40 women - very
funny, typical highland exaggeration

The result of eviction - piping going
on for several days - no recruits , We have
no country to fight for, you robbed us of
our country & gave it to the sheep; therefore, since you have preferred
sheep to men, let sheep defend you.
