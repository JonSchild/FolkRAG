Dear Sir: 
In this morning's mail we received a communication
that gives us some concern and we wish to ask if you can have it
investigated.
It seems that Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, last
summer when a C.C.C. Camp was closed the officer in command
ordered his men to excavate a deep trench and then had them
throw in a large quantity of old shovels, axes, several tractors
that were no longer useable and at least one old motor truck and
then had them covered over. It is also reported that the same
officer had large quantities of old rubber boots, etc. burned.
This sounds almost fantastical but the American Legion
Post in that vicinity state that they know where the said trench
is and that it can be uncovered with the permission of the U.S. 
Government. We know that some officers had peculiar ideas twenty-five
years ago and it may be that some still have them.
Could you have your salvage men in the Soo district
contact the Legion post there and if the trench can be discovered
ave it opened and the offending material placed into the channels 
of production? I am sure the Legion Post will be glad to furnish
the labor without charge. 
Sincerely yours,
/s/
