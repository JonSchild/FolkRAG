JOHN HARDY
DAVY CROKETT WARD'S VERSION, GALAX, VA.

Galax

John Hardy was a wild reckless man,
He carried two big guns;
He killed a man in Shawnee Camps
And John Hendy had to run, poor boy,
And John Hardy had to run.

John Hardy was a gambling man,
And he gambled mighty hard;
He killed a gambler in Shawnee Camps
Over his last game of cards, poor boy,
Over his last game of cards.

John Hardy was hiding in the east-end tunnell,
It was so dark he could scarcely see;
The Sheriff slipped up and grabbed him by the arm
And said,Come on ,Johnny, go with me,go with me,
Come on,Johnny,go with me.

They took John Hardy to the Court House
To hear what the judge would say;
But he refused to give him bail,
And they throwed John Hardy in the jail, poor boy,
And they throwed John Hardy in the jail.

His father and his mother was standing around:
My son,what have you done?
I killed a man in Shawnee Camp
And now I'll have to be hung, Lordy Lord,
And now I'll have to be hung.

John Hardy,do you want your big check cashed?
Do you want any small change?
Are you going to stay in welch and lay in the jail
While your poor mother is deranged,Oh Lord,
While your poor mother is deranged?

I don't want my big check cashed, 
I don't need any small change;
All I want is my forty-four gun,
I would blow out another man's brains,Lordy Lord,
I would blow out another man's brains.

John Hardy had a pretty little girl,
She was pretty as she could be;
But she would set herself on another man's knee
And she'd tell him what she wouldn't tell me, I know,
And she'd tell him what she wouldn't tell me.

John Hardy had another girl,
She dressed herself in red;
She put her arms around his neck and said,
John Hardy, I had rather be dead,
John Hardy, I'd rather be dead.

I've been to the East, I've been to the West,
I've been this wide world round;
I've been to the river and been baptized,
I'm standing on my hanging ground, Oh Lord,--I'm standing on my hanging ground.
