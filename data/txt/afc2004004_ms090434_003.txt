S.H. Kyle Plantation
by Josie Young
Oh, I am so grateful to the Lord for taking care of me
from the earliest of my existence until now. I had landed over 
in the year 48 whether I keep alive to the end or no. When 
I speaks about myself I means mother and George, too.
I went to Clarksdale Sunday night to the Centennial Church. 
They had a fine meeting. Rev. West. certainly preach. The pastor 
took eleven for membership. The choir furnished music through-
out the program. They sung very, very nice.
Mr. Kyles will finish gathering cotton this week. They are 
wrecking the land as fast as they can. Oh, the carpenters
 are working , too.
Good news at last. Mr. Kyles did get to my house to fix it. Mr.
 Robert Dees and his helpers did fine work. It looks much better 
inside. Mr. Dees says he believes in doing good jobs. Mr. 
Dees don't stop his work to talk. He talks and works tight on. 
Mr. Dees deserves what he makes. He is a fine white carpenter. 
Oh, after they finished, George, Edward and I had a time 
cleaning off the yard, taking those bricks away. They knocked 
down our chimney, built us a flue and brought us a heater.
 I don't know why Mr, Kyles don't give me my present ifh he
go much longer he will have to double it. He gave us a New
 Year bag but it didn't come up to our antisipation like those 
Christmas bag be's. 
He gave the tenants a big time the Wednesday before Christmas.
 I didn't go.
