B. Projects not yet finally approved                                    Estimated cost
1. Mississippi Delta Socio-Musical Survey
Some time in November Mr. Lomax will take the Model Y machine to Mississippi to make a recording check on an elaborate survey of the musical habits of this Delta community which will have been made by three Negro graduate students from Fisk University.  This trip will result in a publication sponsored by the Social Science Department of Fisk University.  I believe also that it will mean the establishment of permanent folk-song activity at Fisk.
                                                                                                  $1367.90
2. Texas, the Rio Grande Valley
Brownie McNeil has for nearly a year had a Farmer Fellowship of the University of Texas to collect the corridos of the border country.  He has a large and a very important collection which he wishes to record.  The University of Texas is able to make available a very find recording machine.  The Library plans to furnish his with 100 blanks, needles, and duplicates of the field records.
                                                                                                       377.00
3. New England, 1941
Eloise Linscott, compiler and editor of folk-songs of New England, and the only active collector in the area that I know of, has requested the loan of a Library machine for a month this fall to use in recording folk-songs in Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts.  The project is under consideration.
                                                                                                       350.00
4. Alabama, 1941-42
John A. Lomax feels that the most important job the Library can do this year is to further record the material available to Mrs. Ruby Rickens Tartt in central Alabama.  He has recording to do between Dallas, Texas, and Livingston, Alabama, where he plans to instruct Mrs. Tartt in the use of a machine and leave it with her for two months' intensive work.  Total cost including Mr. Lomax's expenses to and from Alabama:
                                                                                                         800.00
5. Colorado Mining Ballads
