I
Hey girls, and boys.
Lets do our parts
By beating up the japs
And wiping them off the maps.

II
It will be a great joy
If we just dump hitler in
the frying pan.
And let Turkey and Greece Fry him
instead of him frying turky in Greece.

III
A slip of the lip may sink a ship.

IV
Walking up the street [mea] meeting a 
jap.
Take him by the head.
And make like a sap.
