   On one of our ships of war recently,
the Captain was up on the bridge.
All of a sudden he felt hungry, so
asked a Lieutenant to go to the kitchen
and get him a couple of ham sandwiches
and a glass of milk.
   The Lieutenant was off to the kitchen
(or galley) where he found the cook
prostrate across the table moaning.
The Lieu. gave the order, but the cook
just moaned "O o o o o o o o o."
   In a few minutes the Lieu. came back
and said, "Cook the Captain says that
if you don't get that order up prompto,
he will have you shot." In which
the cook replied "O o o o o o, I wish he
would." He was seasick.

This bit of humor came from Walter Winchell
