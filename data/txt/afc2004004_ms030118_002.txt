REVERAND GARY DAVIS
REEL V

(Don't you think you're an unusually wise person, Reverend Davis?) 
   I don't know.. I know what I know, though, will keep me livin. 
(Not forever though.) 
Well, the rabbit will run a long time fore he's caught. Yea. Sometime he git shot. The dog'll take the hair out of the rabbit. Then he goes in the gun an git caught... Maybe somebody'll murder me. Maybe somebody'll slip upon me, but they'll have to be sho nuff smart. 
(Do you think that you'll go to heaven when you die?)
Nobody goes theahâ€¦ Ain't nobody lef heah an went theah, an sent back no news bout goin theah. Ain't nobody went to Hell an come back an said nothin bout how it was neither... You want me to tell you where heaven gon be at?... Right heah. Right chere on this earth. Aftah this ole earth is burnt up of the ungodly nation. 
(what is the ungodly nation?)
People that don't serve God. That don't believe, an don't confess Jesus...The bible tells me that we'll live forever. The Bible said it gon be a Hereafter. It's gon be right heah.
(Will we be in out same form?) 
No. No. You won't be in this heah. No. You gon git out of this body an git in a spiritual body. Be des like God himself. 
(Eating, drinking, love-making?)
No. Nothin like that no mo.
