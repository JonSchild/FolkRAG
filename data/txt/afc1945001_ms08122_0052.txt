83 Days In A Raft

     Three sailors who had been found on a
raft had a strange story to tell.
Two of them were Dutchmen and the
other was an American. They had been on a
raft for eighty three day, beginning sometime
in November their ship was sunk. At first there
were five, aboard the raft but two died after
sixty six day of expouser. When the survivers
were asked what they wished to eat, the
American thought of the meals his mother made,
but then remembered he was on a navy ship
and asked for beanss.
