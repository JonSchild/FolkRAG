talkin bout.
     (Even if you sought the Kingdom of God, and his
righteousness, you could still h ave bad luck --)
     Oh no. Oh no.  No.
     (You believe then that if you once become truly
righteous, you will find your mate then?)
     Thass what God say.  An if you find it, He say, Ask an
it shall be given.  An all these things shall be added unto you.
     (I notice lots of religious people have a hard time in
their marriages.)
     Well!  They got the thing they wanted.  They didn't git
wh at God wanted them to h ave.  God will let you stick yo hand out
an git what you want, an catch all kind of grief an hell.  Thass what
will happen.  You don't have any trouble with the thing that God give
yo u.  It's on account of your own wants.  We should n eed mo than
we want.  We shouldn't want so much.  We should need sumpin.  You see?
Little diff'rent in the wantin an n eedin.  Want is nothin but a
lust.  Need is sumpin you got to have.  An you can find plenty room
fur a need.  You can fill up every room you got with the need.
But you ain't got no room fur want.  Jes like you look out theah
an see a man.  Yo u say, "Thass a nice, healthy-lookin man.  I
could use him, i f I h ad him."  Well, thass nothin but a want.
But the Bible strickly gave you this -- this -- this un derstanin.
"Seek fur the Kingdom, an it'll supply all of yo needs." 
Bury all thoughts of want, an then when you did git, you'll git
wh at you need.  An you be satisfied with that.  Cause it'll
hit the very spot, too. . . .See?. . .
