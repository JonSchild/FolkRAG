The average salary for white teachers in elementary schools is $557, which
is 1.5 times the average salary of Negro teachers (361). For the rural
elementary schools of Alabama white teachers average $568 and Negro teachers
$292, the salary ration being 1.9 to 1.0.

Because of the poor pay and heavy teaching load imposed on southern
rural teachers, and particularly Negro teachers, well-trained persons avoid
the rural schools. In the elementary schools of the county, 35.4 per cent
of white teachers and 39.7 per cent of Negro teachers had less than two
years of college training. Capable teachers are hard to get and harder to
hold. Thirty-one per cent of the Negro elementary teachers and 28.7 per cent
of the white teachers had two years or less of teaching experience. In both
training and experience the Negro teachers are apparently inferior to the
white teachers. The discrepancy, however, is much less than the difference
in salaries and teaching load.

Expenditures per pupil enrolled are $24.10 for white children and
$8.38 for Negro children. The per capita expenditures of white pupils are
thus 2.88 times greater than for Negro pupils. If per capita expenditures
are computed on the basis of average daily attendance, white pupils receive
$30.65 and Negro pupils $11.74, the ratio being 2.61 to 1.00. Of the $24.10
spent for each white child, $17.10 goes to salaries of teachers and supervisors.
This leaves $7.00 for other expenses. Transportation costs are
$3.00 per pupil enrolled, leaving $4.80 per pupil for school supplies, textbooks,
operation and maintenance of school plant, fixed charges and auxiliary
services (attendance, health, libraries, et cetera). All of the expenditures
for Negro pupils except $.95 goes to teachers' and supervisors' salaries.
Since Negro pupils receive no transportation, $.95 remains to be used for
supplies, maintenance, and like needs.
