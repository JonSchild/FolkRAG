Tape: 892 cont. Nimrod Workman
book, Nimrod and the Indian Tribe, Nimrod was a great hunter
in the Cherokee tribe. And then there was one way back of
old Nimrod, he wanted to help build a tower they have there,
so many sunk, so many still standing there... That's all the
Nimrods I knowed of right up to me, I names one of mine
Nimrod, and one of my grandsons is named Nimrod. Me and
my grandson is the only ones I know of living, that are named 
Nimrod. But you go back and hunt up that...
Miles... I told him that and he
got a whole book of it, he said, you're right. And he had
that book... you know Miles... old Miles said, I got that book
buddy. He said, I wouldn't take nothing for it. Nimrod, the
great hunter, the mighty hunter, in the Cherokee tribe. You'll 
find it if you go and get that book. Miles will tell you right
where to get one... (then AL asks him to start Daniel song 
again)...
Al: What song you going to sing?
Nimrod: This is a song I wrote, huh, back when I was single,
guess about 65 or 70 years ago, in Glen Ellen, W. VA. That
song just come to me... there was an old woman, you know. Oh,
she was horrible looking. She'd take out her teeth, and she
had a glass eye and she'd take it out. I didn't let her hear
me make this song, I put the... head to it, you know. (he sings)

Well, I tell you a story of a burglar man
He went out to rob a house
And up by the window side, he creeped as quietly as a mouse.
