Mr. R. S. Boggs,
Box 625,
Chapel Hill
University of North Carolina. 

Dear Mr. Boggs:
I shall forward your letter on to my father and urge
him to bring his bibliography up to date.  He has published
a number of articles in the past year or so
which are not generally known, and I am sure he will 
be glad to furnish you with this material.  If it
would not be too much trouble, could you send me a
list of the publication (with dates) in which your
Folklore Bibliographies have previously appeared?

Do you plan to carry a recording machine on your 
folklore expedition into Mexico and to use it in
recording folk songs?  If so, I should be most interested 
in hearing what the results of the trip
will be.

My best wishes for the success of your expedition.
I am

 Sincerely yours,
