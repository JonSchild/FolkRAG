REPORT OF RUMORS – P3
Relations setup.  That made me laugh because I had fired the 
same man a year ago for inefficiency.”  (San Francisco -
August 10. – Advertising man.)

“Some one certainly has messed up the Aleutian Islands
situation as far as we’re concerned.  It’s bad enough to have
the Japs on some of the Islands, but it looks like they’ll occupy
others before we can stop them and it always costs heavily to
dislodge the enemy.”  (Redwood City – August 13. – Newspaper man)

“People come in here all the time and say we are going to 
be bombed next month for sure.  I don’t know where they think
they get their information but certainly that is a rumor.” (San
Francisco – August 11. – Womens’ Volunteer Service Organization -
Information desk)

“The rumor seems to be prevalent without any justification
that men in the shipyards are not turning out the work that they
should.  This seems to come indirectly from the shipyard workers
themselves as it is repeatedly said that foremen are inexperienced
and are not aware of the urgency of the defense program.”  (Berkely
- August 11. – Manager of Hotel)

“I heard that some one tried to blow up the bay bridge last
night.  I didn’t see anything about it in the papers this morning
though.  It is funny the papers can’t print that stuff and let us
know what is going on.”  (Oakland – August 12. – Apartment House
Manager.)
