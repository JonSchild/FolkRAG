2.  I believe there is some tire bootlegging going on because I saw a man
bring two apparently new tires into a shop on East Washington.  I
remarked to the shop owner that he didn't seem to be having any
trouble getting new tires and he said, "He's been bringing them in
every day--probably stole them somewhere."  (Men on the street in the
