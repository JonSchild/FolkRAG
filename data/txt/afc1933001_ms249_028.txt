Sacrifice Will Win

May all men in uniform in the service of
our country, O captain of their Salvation,
be steadfast in upholding what is noble in
manhood, and in enduring sacrifices for
truth and freedom. In Thy name. Amen.

The word "sacrifice" is stern but noble,
calling in clear, impelling tones from pulpit,
platform, radio, and on printed page, as the
united voice of the nation for unstinted consecration
and courage.

The millions of young men now assembling
for their service of their country are
asked to leave homes, occupations, opportunities,
and plans for home-making, and to
engage in rigid training for hardship and
peril, perhaps even death. What comfort
can they find in such service? And in sacrifice,
unequaled by any others of their contemporaries?

The victory they are to win will be certain 
if their spirit of entire devotion never
faints. The best character of men and
women, the most constructive service for
human welfare, the most decisive victories
for truth and freedom have been recorded
in that one word sacrifice!

Jesus was comparatively a young man when
he heard the call of spiritual conscription.
"The spirit of the Lord is upon me" was his
testimony as he began his unceasing sacrifice
for others.

Jesus willingly bore all burdens, paid all
costs, suffered all things, without fear or
rebellion. His death upon a shameful cross
was his supreme sacrifice, but he drew all
men unto him and that was the greatest of
all victories.

Jesus shrank from the bitter cup of betrayal
and death but he did not refuse to
drink from it. He revealed the secret of 
triumphant living when he declared that
"except grains of wheat fall into the ground
and die, no rich harvest follows. In certain
noble meanings the life that is lost is the
most fruitful.

Among the factors which will strengthen
and make the sacrifices of the host of uniformed
men triumphant are these:

Refuse to harbor venomous vindictiveness
or other inhuman passions.

Keep faith with plighted love.

Shrink not before any peril or temptation
that must be met.

Study the moral issues involved in the
present struggle to prevent the worst slavery
that has threatened truth and freedom and
worship in human history.

Cherish the pledge that a peace shall be
won which shall make the world secure from
the wrongs and falsehoods which brought
about the present warfare.

There Were Giants in the Earth in Those Days
(Continued from page 7)

was returned to his cell, he converted his 
three jailers who joined him in martyrdom.
  It was a Cappadocian soldier, George, 
who threw up his command under Diocletian, 
went boldly to the Senate House,
avowed his faith in Christ, spoke of the 
absurdity of idol-worship. Thereupon
George was tortured, dragged through the 
streets, and beheaded.  We know him as 
St. George, the patron saint of democracy's
island fortress, England.
  The world in our time has grown kindlier
—at least on the surface— toward the follower
of the Lord. Martyrdom is less
often the pathway of victory.  Yet, in
quality of sublime trust and unyielding
tenacity of conviction, the Christian layman's
faith and faithfulness are not different
today.  If the tests to which the modern
layman is subjected are, at the moment, less
severe, no less strong is his essential inner 
re-enforcement by the Lord.
  Nationally, we take inspiration for the 
strain of the hour from the barefooted
heroes of Valley Forge, "Who more than
self their country loved."  As disciples within
a common Church, not 165 but 1900 years
of age, we take courage and inward renewal
from the centuries' harassed pilgrims 
of faith, who mocked at dungeon and
death, loving communion with Christ and
his followers more than their own flesh.

The title of this article from the sixth
chapter of Genesis well describes the kind
of men who have, through the centuries, 
stood for their Savior, even through agony.
Today their messages, written in blood, are
as clear as when they were written.  Their
testimonies speak to the lay member as well
as to his ordained leader.   Through them
the seeds of the new Church were sown in 
the mingled blood of Savior and saint.
