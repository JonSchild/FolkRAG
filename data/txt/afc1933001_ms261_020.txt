This set will be sent to a large number
of Latin American libraries, universities
& museums as a testament of the
richness of the folk-song
tradition of the United States. Plans
for another & similar set are under
consideration for the current year.
The records will be acc. by descriptive notes
[Publication]
and texts in English.

Publication & Public Relations

The records of the Latin
American set will be available for
purchase from the Recording Laboratory
either in albums or on single 
records. They will bring the voices
of American singers recorded in
lonely places in the hills & farm
land of this country to the schools,
colleges & homes of America. This
certainly is the most important forward
step in the Archive's grown as a 
center of distribution of folk song.
