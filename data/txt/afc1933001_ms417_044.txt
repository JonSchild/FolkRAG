ARKANSAS HARD LUCK BLUES
By Lonnie Glossom, on Perfect Record, Matrix C 1543-1
Spoken matter-of-factly with a fast guitar accompaniment.
By George, you know, a feller down in Oklahoma run for state office and used this Arkansas Hard Luck Blues for his campaign literature. I told you that they all sang the same song ....
Now, folks, I'm gonna tell you a little something about myself - 
You know, I come from down in Arkansas.
I live down there on a little farm where the land is so poor
You have to put fertilizer around the telephone poles
Before you can talk over the wires.
But nevertheless, it's a fine place to be from, folks.
You know, I was born down there in Arkansas.
Yeah, and I can remember the first day I was born, too. 
There was three of us kids -
We was all laying side by side on the bed -
I heard the door slam, and the old man, he come in.
He walked up to the bed and he just taken one look at us;
He hollered to my maw - she was in the kitchen gettin' dinner -
He says, "All right, Lize,"
Says, "Come On In Here,"
Says, "Pick out the one you want,"
And says, "We'll drown the rest of 'em"
You know folks, there was just seventeen is us kids.
There was eight boys, seven girls,
And two other children.
You know, I had but a little age on me
When the old man said,
"Son, you gonna have to get out and make your own livin' from now on,"
He says, "I'm tired of feeding' you around this place."
Well, I struck out, folks,
And her's what happened ever since.
You know, I been bawled out and bawled up,
Held down and held up,
Bulldogged, blackjacked, walked on, and chewed,
Squeezed and mooched for war tax,
Excess profits, state, dog, and sin tax.
Liberty bonds and baby bonds,
And the bonds of matrim ony.
