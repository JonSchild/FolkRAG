Dear Bess:

As far as I know, I shall be here Tuesday and look 
forward to seeing you.  If anything should come up, I shall 
let you know.

Elizabeth writes me that the records arrived and I 
trust they were satisfactory.  Many thanks for Alan's record, 
which is quit unusual.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
