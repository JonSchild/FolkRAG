Dear Mr. Spinacke:

I think Ten Dollars a day
for fifty days will clear up all
the notes I can put on the records.
Miss Terrill will work with me
doing the typing as well as collaborating
on the notes where she was
with me. If you prefer, you can
propose five dollars a day for each
of us. I understand that this
travelling for recording and for the
talk in Milwaukee will be on the
same basis as formerly. Please
figure the round trip mileage
to Milwaukee from Washington
in addition to the mileage I
mentioned in my former
letter.
