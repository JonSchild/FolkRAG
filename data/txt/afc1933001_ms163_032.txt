Dear Sir:
          Dr. Allen has told me that you are the one to whom I should
write for information about the recording of Basque music in Boise, 
Idaho. My interest in the work is twofold since Boise is my home and
I find this particular manifestation of its musical life intriguing
and since Dr. Allen says that I can be of service to you while
collecting material for my thesis here.
          Research of the sort is new to me, hence I would appreciate
your suggestions as to customary procedure. I have been investigating
such collections as Gardner and Chickering's Ballads and Songs 
of Southern Michigan and Henry's Folksongs from the Southern Uplands.
A thesis written here at Stanford by Henry Endicott Hanson,
French Influences on the Folk Songs of Louisiana seems more like 
the work I might do.
           It would be convenient for me to make the necessary preliminary 
arrangements while I am in Boise at Christmas and complete the recording 
the following summer. If it were desirable I believe the recording
could be done during the immediate holiday season since the 
sheepherders are in town at that time.
            Dr. Allen has suggested that the Library of Congress can help me
in financing the project and give me directions so that it can be
