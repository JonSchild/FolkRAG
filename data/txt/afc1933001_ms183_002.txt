Dear Mr. Lomax;
Thank you for your letter of May 27.
Your information will be of considerable value
to us.
Are you acquainted with the work of
Mr. H.C. Frey, 640 North Second Street, Steelton,
Pennsylvania, and his son, Dr. J. William Frey,
Presbyterian College, Clinton, S. C., relative
to Pennsylvania folk music.  Professor Frey
prepared music for several of the old-time
wagonner's ballads which were sung at the
annual Pennsylvania Folk Festivals.
Most sincerely
S.K. Stevens
