A branch of The Old Chisholm Trail ran close by our ranch in Texas and on through the Indian Territory, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana.  Twelve million cattle and a million horses were drifting northward up the Chisholm Trail and other cattle trails.  The cowboys who drove the cattle as they rode along, sang and called and yodeled to them.  They made up songs.

These songs I began to write out when yet a small boy, and later Harvard University made me a Sheldon fellow for three years and I set out to collect them.

In 1909, I went to the Cattle Convention in Fort Worth, Texas.  One night I found myself in the back room of the White Elephant Saloon with my small Edison recording machine that used wax cylinders.  Instead of a mike I carried a big horn which the cowboys refused to sing into.  One said to the crowd:  "I told the Professor that the old Chisholm Trail was as long as the trail from Texas to Montana.  Some of the verses would burn up his old hown.  I sang him 73 and he begged me to stop.  "He can learn about trail customs from that old song."

It's cloudy in the west and a-lookin' like rain,
And my blamed old slicker's in the wagon again.

That unlucky cowboy had left his yellow slicker, a waterproof coat, in the chuck wagon gone miles ahead and now the rider was in for a good soaking.

Another couplet runs:

Stray in the herd and the boss said kill it,
So we bedded that stray in the bottom of the skillet.

A bunch of cowboys ready for fresh meat for supper-- a supper that cost the boss nothing.  For a law of the trail made fair game of stray cattle that drifted into the herd.
