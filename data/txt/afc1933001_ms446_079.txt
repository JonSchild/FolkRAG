64 

Sweeter to me than honeycomb, 
Is Christ's despised name. 

Let us, with undissembled love, 
Like children, hand in hand 
March to our Father's house above, 
And to the promis'd land. 

You've heard the gospel sounding, 
Take the alarm and fly ; 
Arise, and now to Christ be gone, 
For there is danger nigh. 

You little flock, I bid adieu, 
Our parting is today ; 
O !  let us all to Christ prove true, 
And always watch and pray. 

Since I've been here, you've been dear ; 
I've always found you kind ; 
But now through grace, I quit the place, 
And leave you all behind. 

And if we never meet below,
Let us our lamps prepare,
To meet when the last trump shall blow, 
And in his glory share. 

There is one thing that wounds my heart, 
And grieves my spirit sore, 
To think we must in body part,
Perhaps to meet no more. 

So, fare you well, my dearest friends, 
With melting hearts we part ; 
God make us faithful to the end, 
Your souls are near my heart. 

We need not wait but few days more,
