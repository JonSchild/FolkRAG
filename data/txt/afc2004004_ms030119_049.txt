knows you when you jabber -- talk to it.  You understan?
It'll git to tryin to jabber when you git to talkin to it.  Notice
every lil thang th at you talk to it ab out.
     (Even if it noticed strange sounds in the room, it
wouldn't know what was going on, would it?)
     I done tole you what to do.  Thass right.  Every li ttle
thing, that chile will pick up.  It may not know what it's
doin, but it'll pick it up.  Then you wanna know where it got it from.
     (Do you think that would be harmful to the child?)
     Would it be harmful?. . .It'll make you shamed!  An
perhaps ruin the chile.  Chile comes up wid it in him.  You might want
to step off an leave the chile wid some of your n eighbors an friends.
You see?  It'd be tryin that same thang it seed you do.  With some
othah kid.  Or be sayin some thangs it heerd yo u say.
     (Do you think children under seven and eight try to
peep and spy on their elders, try to find out what they're doing?)
     Well, chilren is devilish, you know.  You shouldn't 
ask that question.  You should know that.  You should know that.
Thass why you should be careful.
     (I think it's hard to do that though when you have a 
small house?)
     Well, so what!  Hard, so what?  What you wanna worry bout
it bein h ard fur?  You gon dodge it cause it hard?
     (Think of all the people who live in one room cabins
down South.  What can they do?)
     I understan.  But you dodg e it because it hard?
     (Would they have to give up h aving a sex life?)
