Mr. Alan Lomax
124 W. 12th Street
New York City

Dear Alan:

I received the ten dollar bill in
your letter of February 16. Immediately
upon return I sent you the application
from the Learned Societies which I
found awaiting me. We sent it, however,
to your old address. Please rescue this
immediately and follow the instructions
contained in the letter. This, as you
realize, is of greatest importance to 
you, so please do not neglect it.

Sincerely,


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
