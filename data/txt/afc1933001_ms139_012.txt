Dear Sir - i am writing you a few
Lines to let you here from me
Im feeling fine this after noon
Truly hope when these few lines
Reach your hands they will find
You well and having nice time
In hopes you made I in Washington
With out any trouble listen you know
What you promise to send me do you
Think you could get in tatch with
The Decca company for me to make
Record in Chicago if you can get us
In any place will do how did they
Like the records so i will Close
From Calvin Frazier 8586 Russell
St Detroit Mich looking for an
Early reply Yours Truly,
