hotel - last room in the house - the 
whole of 31 W S. of Louisville was 
blazing with life - liquor stores
open - all joints operating - crowded
with hitchhiking soldiers - Ft.
Knox the golden heart of the nation!

July 12. As hot & steamy as jungle weather.
Drove to Bowling Green and found John Vincent,
head of teacher's college music school - folksong
amateur - He agreed to drive to Nashville
and visit the famous Zema Hill's Church (2nd
Sunday.) I at once regretted the decision [fearing?]
to meet some of the Fisk people - did meet
them  at the Church. Was embarrassed by 
handsome, choleric and vigorous
Vincent who says "niggers" Alabama
fashion. The church was like the movement
of a thousand legged sea animals with 
the fluttering of hundreds of fans advising
the world to be buried efficiently by
Zema Hill. Zema's impressive and aloof.
A lonely voice - handsome - a successful
business-man offering symbolic security
to cooks + maids - Service of no interest
Subsequent talks with Vincent - less. He
