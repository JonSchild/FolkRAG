Dear sir:

Can you tell me, without undue inconvenience,
whether the Hatians give names to the drums and treat
them as persons? I have read such a statement but
been unable to find it in print, in a work on Haiti.

In a study of the music of the Indians
of Santo Domingo, for the Southwest Museum, I find a
custom of naming the drums and treating them as
individuals. I have not found this in any other
Indian tribe. If it exists also in Haiti, it may
be a custom derived, indirectly, from that country or from
a common source.

May I ask that you will kindly give
me a book-and-page reference that I can quote? My
library facilities here are limited, and I am now completing
the manuscript of a book on the music of Santo Domingo.

Sincerely yours,
Frances Densmore
