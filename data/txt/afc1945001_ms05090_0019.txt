August 6 - The next was overheard at a luncheon counter....two business
men were talking, and one said: "The war is much worse than people are realizing
and by January 1st, we are going to see a different world.  My God, I wish we
could get going before it's too late.  The other gentleman replied that "we would
get going when we are able, but evidently we are not strong enough yet", to which
the first gentleman replied in turn, "that's what I'm afraid of, and I'm wondering
when in H.....we will be,.....our forces are too scattered for concentrated
strength at any one place."  [*Omaha, Nebr. 13*]
