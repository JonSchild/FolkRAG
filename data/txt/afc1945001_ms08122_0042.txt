The Time And a Half

     Paul McNutt, head of War
Manpower Commission, says
it may be necessary to establish
a 52 hour week in 
certain war industries.
     The biggest problem is the
amount of pay which workers
may receive, for their additional hours.
     The time and a half pay for
the 40 week is argued by
many that the law which
requires time and a half to
be given for all hours in 
excess of 40 a week should
be set aside for the duration.
Such a law at this time
is said that the employers
will have to pay a higher
price for their wages.
     Most of the employers
will be able to get [?]
along with fewer employees,
since all the workers must
put in longer hours.     Folder 122
