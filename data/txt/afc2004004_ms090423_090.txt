The moderator of the Coahoma County Missionary Baptist Association 
is willing to give us assistance we need. He said we might be interested 
in the semi-annual meeting of the association which is held in 
Clarksdale between the first and second Sundays in November. 

Mr. Nelson, one of the undertakers in Clarksdale said that he 
would post us on interesting funerals. He expressed regret that we were 
not recording now because a big funeral was to be held on the 17th. A 
minister died just before the National Baptist Convention and his body was 
being held twelve days until the ministers returned from Cleveland. There 
were to be thirty ministers as honorary pall bearers. He said that it would 
be an all day affair.   

The groundwork was pretty carefully laid and will be followed 
through with letters to the plantation owners, the county superintendent, 
and Clarksdale newspaper, when the dates of the study are finally decided. 

Interviews and notes will be appended to this report later.
