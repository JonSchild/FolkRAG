BEAUTIFUL DRIVES
     When you come to Beaver Island bring your car as you will enjoy
driving over our good roads of which we have more than 100 miles.
These roads wind through the woods and follow the shore line around
the Island.  There is no "Man Made" scenery on Beaver Island.  No
paved streets.  You will like your car better off the hot, paved highways.
     Comfortable transportation is provided from Charlevoix, Mich., by 
boat leaving that port daily.  Transportation on this same boat for your
car is available.
HOW TO REACH BEAVER ISLAND
    Charlevoix is provided with 24 train service from New York
and 12 hour service from Chicago.  It is on U.S. Highway 31 and M-66.
The distance from Charlevoix to St. James Harbor is 35 miles and is
covered in slightly less than three hours.  You will enjoy this trip, and 
leaving at 9 a.m. E.S.T. you will arrive at St. James in time for noon-
day dinner. (Time of boat sailings variable according to season - write
for details.)
