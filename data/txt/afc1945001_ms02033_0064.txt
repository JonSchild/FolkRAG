Rationing is unnecessary
1.  At the present time there are enough tires in stock here in New England to 
last the next 30 years.

Ans. According to Mr. Backman of the O.P.A. there is actually a shortage of 
tires in this area. This shortage applies to all rubber products including 
tires. He states that there simply are not enough tires for both civilians and 
the armed forces as well.

2.  The gas shortage was deliberately induced in order to curtail the consumption 
of rubber in tires. 

Ans. As already mentioned, the O.E.M. declares that transportation limitations 
have required gas rationing. It was not done for its indirect effects. Tire 
consumption is controlled directly by the tire rationing system.

Rationing is the fault of our allies
1.  There is a gas shotage because the British have most of our tankers lying
idle in British ports.

Ans.  According to the Information Office of the O. E. M. there are no idle
tankers, British or American, in British ports.  Obviously, with so many being
sunk, both countries are using their tankers to the limit.

2.  A large part of the rubber we now have is being shipped to England.  There
 is no tire rationing there.

Ans.  According to the Information Office of the O. E. M. only a small part of
our rubber supply is being sent to England and that strictly for war purposes.
No sales of tires of any kind were permitted in England from the time of Pearl
Harbor to the present month.

The Red Cross is discriminating against the Negroes
1. Negro blood collected by the Blood Donors Center of the Red Cross is being 
poured down the sink.

Ans.  According to the findings of a negro investigating committee headed by 
Mr. William Harrison of the Boston Chronicle, this rumor is totally without 
foundation in fact.

2. Negro blood is not accepted by the Red Cross Blood Bank.

Ans.  According to the report of the above committee, is accepted and has been accepted since Jan. 24th of this year. 

3.  Animal blood is being used by the Red Cross Blood Bank while Negro blood 
is rejected.

Ans.  The findings of the investigating committee indicate that animal blood 
is being used only for experimental purposes.
