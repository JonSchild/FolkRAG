CONRAY FONTENOT   -5

find him and they brought him there and he says he got
scard of me.  He didn't even know his own brother and was
just crazy.  And on the last they had to go and feed him
when his  time, when it was time to eat.  He didn't even know
whether he was hungry or not.  They just had to feed him.
Oh, he was plumb crazy.  Then he started getting weaker and
weaker and, until he died.
LOMAX  I heard they let him out of there
and he just disappeared.
FONTENOT  No, no.  That wasn't either, no.
LOMAX  Does anybody know where he's
buried?
FONTENOT  I don't know where he's buried.
But I know when died his brother and probably one, his
nephew, they went down there.  They got a, they got a
cemetary.  I believe he must be buried in, in Pine [Hill].
They got a cemetary there.  Where if somebody don't, don't
take their folks well, they bury them there.  They call that 
buried by the state, I believe, or something like that.
LOMAX  Would, would you think that Amaday
composed a lot of the most important songs in, in,  in. . . .
FONTENOT  In the black culture, I would
think so.
LOMAX  Which ones do you think of his
that everybody knows and that are important?
