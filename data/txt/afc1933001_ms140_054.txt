My dear Mr. Lomax:
I wish to thank you very much for the
splendid detailed list you sent me under
date of December 5. From time to time I shall be 
pleased to  suggest some of your books to our supervisors
in Massachusetts who are arranging for programs.
We found it necessary to compile rather
quickly a song list for our rural schools and we
could not follow our original plan as rigidly as 
we hoped. I am forwarding to you under separate
cover our booklet which has been distributed to
over 800 pupils in Massachusetts. We were able to
keep to American music, with the exception of the
art song group.
Thank you again for your very helpful
letter. I appreciate receiving it and know it
will be of great use to me.
Sincerely yours,
Martina McDonald
Supervisor in Educational Research:
Filed of Public School Music.
