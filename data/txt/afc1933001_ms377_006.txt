[3.]

She got away down on the river side,
She wanted to see her old man drown.
he says, "My dear kind wife, I cannot drown
Unless you shove me in" - 

        Love my darlin', oh"
       I Love my darlin', oh"

She gits way back, taken' a long runnin' start,
She goin' shove her old man in,
Old man stepped just a little one side 
And headlong she jumps in - 

        Love my darlin', oh"
       I Love my darlin', oh"

Old man being so kind-hearted,
Knowin' de sweet wife could not swim,
He reached right back and got a long pole â€”
And he shoved her further in - 

        Love my darlin', oh"
       I Love my darlin', oh"

And she whoops and she hollers,
Jest as loud as any woman can squall;
Old man says, "my dear kind wife,
I'm blind and can't see at all"  - 

        Love my darlin', oh"
       I Love my darlin', oh"

Says, come all you young hasty women,
Take warning after me;
Don't never try to down a poor old man
Says  he's blind and cannot see - 

        Love my darlin', oh"
Two - eyed ride a babe (sic)
