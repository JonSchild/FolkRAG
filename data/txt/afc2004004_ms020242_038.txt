know, but that had been almost a year before I got there. Ya see? 

An I hadn't been there, ah, ah, I went there on, on the 'leventh of June. I went there on the 'leventh of June an' the middle of July I was sick, ffrom den on. Eigth solid months...That's right. 

AL: It looks like she would have had mercy on you, Bessie. She new you were sick, and let you get well.  What did she want to kill you for? 

BJ: Well, that what I'm talkin' about now.  She, she, if she hadn't been goin' - - She musta been sumpin' to Will.  I don't know whe' (whether) she was or not. Either one said they wasn't. But that's all I can say, 'cause she say she thought it was his hair she was gettin'.
AL: Nothing was done to her at all, huh?
BJ: No-o. No. 
AL: I mean your mama didn't try to beat her in the head with a fence rail?
BJ: Oh? Oh. No, Mr. Singleton don't do that either, you know? No, no use a-doin' that. Just leave that up to God. But Mama did git mad wit' 'er, ya know? Mama didn' wanna -- Well, Mama give 'em everything. Give 'em peas; give 'em potatas; give 'em milk; just give 'em everything! You know, they want, like that. That's true. But Bessie was so outdone that she begged pardons so much pitiful, ya know. She said, she declared she thought it was Red Boy, ya see. See, 'cause, 'cause he had cussed 'er.

An' that was a poor excuse.  Mr., Mr. Singleton tol' 'er, "That's a mighty poor excuse." He said, "You know, Red Boy's hair don't look like Miss Bessie-mun.‚Äù Huh, sho' didn't either!
