Dallas,Texas.
Dear Mr.Lomax,
I have deliberately postponed writing you, as I was in the
hope of sending you some good news. I hoped to tell you that my negotiations
had been completed and that we could soon start production.
As I wrote you in my original letter, I thought that in addition
to the cultural aspect of your work, there were definite commercial possibilities
in our project. But it seems, that Hollywood instinctively shies away
from anything that even suggests the cultural. "We must not gamble, we must
not experiment" seems to be its creed.
I can't express my dissapointment, not on account of my apparently 
wasted trip to Denver, because that convinced me more than ever that I,
that we were right.
However, I will not give up, and I warn you that one day you will
hear from me telling you that I will meet you in Dallas. I have a complete
set of your recordings which I believe charming and which I will one day
play for some enterprising producer who will see them our way.
Please give my regards to your charming wife and son, whom I hav
never met, but hope to some day, and please let me hear from you.
Sincerely,
Will Jason
