conquer him through himself. Mental confusion, contradictions of 
feelings, indecisions, panic--these are our weapons.'

"If you are hesitant about taking your information to a federal
authority, or to the local police, contact any member of the Columbia
Lions Club Rumor Clinic and they will be delighted to see that it

Leier, vice chairman; N. E. Brown, J. C. Dreher, A. F. Funderburke, Jr.,
