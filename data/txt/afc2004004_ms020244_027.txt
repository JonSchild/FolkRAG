Reel of 9/26/61, Side 1, Song 11

WE'RE CALLED THE CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS
A religious school song

We're called the Christian soldiers,
Do you hear them sing
Honor unto the Captain,
All go gathering.

Now, Jesus is our Captain,
And we shall never fear,
Jesus is enlisted as a volunteer.
A volunteer's a soldier,
And a Christian too.
Jesus is enlisted, 
Oh, why not you?

A variant of the third line is:
Honoring the Captain.

The words "volunteer" and "soldier" are reversed the second time the song is sung.
