OFFICE OF WAR INFORMATION

                                                               October 15, 1942

Mr. David Robinson, Managing Director
Rumor and Propaganda Division
Oregon State Defense Council
101 Oregon Building
Portland, Oregon

Dear Mr. Robinson:

            In our letter of an earlier date we explained to
you our reasons for thinking that the refutation of rumor,
argument by argument, is not necessarily a good idea from
the overall point of view of the national interest, however
much good reading it may create for local newspapers. Your
letter of October 6th poses two rumors which we assume have
been circulated locally in Portland, about which you ask the
facts for refutation.

            It will obviously be impossible for the Office of
War Information or any other Government agency to undertake
the responsibility of answering all of the thousands of
rumors abroad in the land in each of their numerous forms.
The Impossibility of this undertaking, aside from the labor
involved, will be more apparent to you when you consider the
fact that inquiries for information with which to refute
rumors are frequently used to pry strategic information out
of Government offices, which should not be released.

            We are, therefore, very sorry that we are unable
to comply with your request.

                                                       Sincerely yours,

                                                       R. Keith Kane
                                                       Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
