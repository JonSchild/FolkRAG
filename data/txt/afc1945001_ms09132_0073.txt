F. N. M

1. Sacrafice our shoes so that the boys fighting
may have leather to wage a successful war.

2. America must supply all of our allies with munition
to beat the axis powers.

3. Recently our great General Mac Arther's air
force made a devastating attack on a Japanese
convoy, which consisted of 22 ships. Today at the scene
of the attack there only remains driftwood and splotches
of oil. By repeating these decisive battles the allied
forces will unquestionably be victorious
