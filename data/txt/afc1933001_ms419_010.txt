SONG: It's straight from the wagon right into your cell.
It's just like sailing from heaven to Hell.

It's hard times in the lousy old jail,
It's hard times, poor boy

There's a big bull ring in the middle of the floor,
And a big fat jailer to open the door.

And here's to the cook I wish he was dead,
It's old boiled beef and old corn broad.

We pop it down in us within our cells
Just like the pop from heaven to hell

BURL: Man, that's a song.

WOODY: Why shore it is, and don't it make you feel good to
cuss a little?

SONG: And here's to the lawyer he'll come to your cell,
And swears he will clear you in spite of all Hell,
Gets all of your money comes back for the rest,
Tells you to plead guilty for I know it is best.

And there sits the judge to read us the law,
The durndest fool judge that you ever saw.

(BREAKS OFF)

WOODY: You know, fellers, that verse must have been made about
a judge that I watched going over a bunch of prisoners
out in a large and beautiful Western City known to
fame as --- but I needn't mention her. But this here
judge .. (INSERT THE STORY OF THE JUDGE THAT GAVE
THE PRISONER TEN MORE DAYS EVERY TIME HE OPENED HIS
MOUTH)
