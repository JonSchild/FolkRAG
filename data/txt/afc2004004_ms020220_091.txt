     An' ya know what he did? He got fo'ty-eight rattlesnakes
from right there.
TL: By that stump?
BJ: Out, out a that woods. Right in that little bed a woods. The
woods wasn' even -- I guess about as wide, to the corner [of] up here?
It's about a block. Jus', jus' that wide all around. People's
fields come in every part around that little skit a woods. He
got 48 out a there, right near that stump.
     'Cause ya know what he did? He went on up on that little
hill, show, show where I was struck at, at. An' ah, in this
lawg (log), it's a great lawg. Big ol' high lawg was there. An' ah
it's [ah, an'], that lawg was slick as this table. And the mens --
as I tol' ya befo', mens didn't gamble befo' chirrun. On that
lawg was where those men would sit Sattiday evening an' Saturday
night an' gamble. An' little places where they'd have their
fire was all around-round there. An' that place was slick as a 
mole. All, clean ya know all around there. An' in that lawg he got out
15 rattlesnakes.
TL: Oh, my God.
BJ: Hah, an', an' those men like to had a fit. Hah, especially
the one called Mr. Coo. Mr. Coo slep' out there all night that
night before [I] us went out there to pick berries. Say he got broke
an' drunk an' laid [out] there an' slept [there]; tha's what I heard them
say. An' he say -- An' that man jus' jump up, [jus'] look like -- Liked
to had a fit. 15 was in that hollow.
     You see, that hollow was so big that they didn't jar them,
ya see? They jus' stayed in that [hollow] log. An' he said that was
the young ones of this other, the one that struck at me. See?
