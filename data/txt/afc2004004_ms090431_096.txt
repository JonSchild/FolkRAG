This game is payed by a prominent first call and you have an object 
in your hand.  As the song began, the object is given to one of the 
players, the It, and whenever we get near to the It, the person will 
say Bobaneddle is running in answering to you.  And whenever you say 
Bobaneedle is stop, you think he is because you can't find him.  And 
whenever you catch Bobaneedle, well, this object is given to another It 
and in turn.
A:  THe object is a hidden needle?
That's right.  If Iam careful, when the object is behind me. 
I learned this song about 24 years ago in my mother's home.  In fact, 
she taught it to me.  I taught it to the children in my school.

Umm, umm.

Umm, umm.
Two green beans and a blackeyed pea.
Umm, umm,
