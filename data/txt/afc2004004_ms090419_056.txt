Fisk, 9. 15.

Smoking cigarettes
Will kill you dead, [checkmark]
Will kill you dead.
I goes to the Gyps[ies]y
To get my fortune told,
[Say what I dine on] See Will I die now or when
[Til] I get old.

To the Gypsies
To git my fortune told,
The Gypsies told me
[About a] You got a sweet jelly roll.
Oh, [Iâ€™ll get] You got a sweet jelly roll.

I asked that woman
How about it,
She said, all right.
I pulled off my clothes,
And I stayed all night.
Oh, Lord, and I stayed all night.

If the sun shine hot
And the day[s] stay long,
I'm gonna take the two shaded bushes
To be my home.
