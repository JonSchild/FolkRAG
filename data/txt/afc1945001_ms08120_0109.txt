Actors Entertain Soldiers

Many of our friends and relatives
are in different branches of the armed
forces. These men like some kind of
entertainment so many of the actors and
actresses render their services for entertainment
to the men.

While listening to a program
one night I heard this joke on Bob Hope's program.
James Cagney was Hopes guest. Hope asked
Cagney, "After winning the academy award
why are you on a program like mine?" Cagney
replied, "well I've been walking on air so
long I thought I'd come back to mud."
