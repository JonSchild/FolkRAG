As you know, Elizabeth is in Mexico, due to a sudden 
change in our plans, and this added to the effect of the 
sad accident in Detroit and the unusual expenses of the past 
week, have completely drained my pocket.  I suppose it might 
be possible to get along on my salary as it comes in, but 
I think if you can possibly arrange to have an other advance 
of fifty dollars made me, I will be able to work more 
comfortably and freely.  If that is not possible, perhaps 
[you] I can borrow the money on my car.  I will, if my salary 
arrives tomorrow, leave here for a week's work in this 
part of Michigan, planning to arrive in Mackinac City in 
a week's time.  Have word for me there of that you have been 
able to arrange, please.

Under seperate cover I am expressing you fifty acetate 
records (Ihave made 66so far).  And tommorrow I am sending you 
three sapphire needles for resharpening.  They do not last 
the hundred records they are advertized to, at least not 
without quite a bit of surface noise.  The Reeves acetate , 
bought from Soundscriptions is, I am nearly convinced, 
better than the Presto, so , if you have occasion to buy 
more buy that please.

Upper Michigan is full of old lumberjacks, much to 
my surprise , and I expect to get this next couple of weeks 
enough lumberjack song [that] so that we won't have to 
go begging to any of the local folk-lorists for material.

I don't know where Dr. Putnam is, but I as forwarding to 
him a copy of the Indiana field notes, fully corrected.  If 
he is not in the Library, I hope you will see to it that they 
are forwarded to him.  I would like him to know what I can 
accomplish for the Archive with help.

Why wasn't the second machine insured or was it?  This 
is a pretty important step after the Detroit debacle, it 
seems to me.

I am writing to Waters in hopes he can begin to 
forgive father for the terrific mistake he made in regard to 
Cowboy songs.  I only hope he doesn't believe that I had anything 
to do with the title page.  In fact, I was [???] 
terribly surprised to see what they had done.

The new machine does nice work and I am gradually learning 
how to record at 33 without too much surface.

Best regards,
Alan
