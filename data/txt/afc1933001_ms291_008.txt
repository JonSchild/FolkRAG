CLAREMONT INN, RIVERSIDE DRIVE &
124TH STREET
(Take Bus No. 4 down Riverside Drive)
The Claremont Inn, once a private house, was built
in 1806 by Michael Hogan, an Irish immigrant from
County Clare.  But the house is said not to have been
names for Hogan's County Clare, but after "Claremont",
the Royal estate of Prince William [William
IV] of England, who had sailed with Hogan as a
midshipman in the British navy, later visiting him in
America.  The house was occupied for a time by the
Earl of Devon and in 1815 by Joseph Bonaparte, the
ex-King of Spain.  The trial trip of the first steamboat,
Fulton's Clermont, took place opposite this
point.
