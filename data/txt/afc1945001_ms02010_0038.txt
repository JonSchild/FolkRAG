Rumor Reporting

The first responsibility of a rumor-control project is,
obviously the careful collection and analysis of rumors. In order
to have a truly representative collection and analysis of rumors,
rumor control groups should contain representatives of civic clubs,
different religious denominations, unions, minority groups, educators,
professional men. It is desirable to enlist the help of skilled
persons who can devote themselves to the systematic reporting
of rumors.

Rumor reports are most useful if submitted in writing,
signed by the reporter. The signature is simply a testimony of good
faith; the names of reporters should never be disclosed. Experience
shows that rumor reports should never be accepted (or encouraged) over
the telephone: first, because the use of the telephone exaggerates
the seriousness of the rumor; and second, because the telephone
encourages spontaneous conversation about the rumor instead of
considered analysis of the total body of rumors.
