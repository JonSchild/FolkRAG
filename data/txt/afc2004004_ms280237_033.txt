through anyhow. (pause) She lived till she was ninety four. (pause) 
She'd had a hard life. 

Lomax: What about your father? 

Cox: My father. . .he'd had a rough life that far, I mean he had done 
a little roughin' about, an' he was a poachin' man too. He - he 
used to like that game. He used to like - after the old hares 
- gunnin'. He used to go an' lay his old hares in Barton Church porch 
when he used to go that way. He shot many a hare in in Barton 
Church [y] yard. An'. . .Then he used to. . .if he got more than he could 
carry, I've heard - he used to tell me, o' course, I didn't know 
- I wasn't. . .He used to lay 'em in there till he come back. If he 
got three or four old hares, he'd take 'em into the porch. Nobody'd 
ever go in after 'em, he reckoned. There wasn't one out of twenty 
durst go into church yard[xO] o' night - dead o' the night. They 
were afraid. He went an' laid 'em in there, they'd be all right 
till he came back. Be a sure place [large empty space] in the yard, he 
reckoned. I don't think he was [i] afraid of anything. I never knew 
no one to frighten him. (pause) He'd go anywhere. Wasn't no one 
frighten him. (pause) 

Lomax: Well, wasn't it considerable risky, that poaching, Harry? 
I mean, couldn't he get sent to prison, if he got caught? 
[Cox:]
Cox: Yes, course, they could ha' done that if he - if they'd ha' 
catched him. Course they had these nets - gate nets an' dogs an' 
guns. Well, that was all the go, there was plenty [tht] there like 
him. I mean, that was a real do, then. An old hare was worth a half 
a crown, an' that's what they was studyin' on. (laughs) 

Lomax: That was more wages than you'd get in a week. 

Cox: Well, I - I only got ten shillin's; I got ten shillin's a 
week; that was all you got. And I remember gettin' nine. I 
remember gettin'. . .They dropped down to nine for a fortnight. An' 
the place where he - the place where he used to work on - Mack, his 
name was Mack - they dropped him one fortnight. He was a-doin' 
- doin' a water - water-drain[in] out; where the water run. He reckoned 
he had a good mind to drowned him in there, when he went in the 
next day, at the drop of a hat. He didn't like the idea. He cut 
him down a shillin', that's nine shillin's. He took that home on 
the old lady's birthday, that was. He lay down there a little piece, till 
somebody said, "You're got a birthday present here." Course that 
was a good un. Then there was a little bit of a flare up. She 
didn't like the idea of that; 'cause she didn't know what to do 
with that little lot, that was worse. (laughs) 

Lomax: What, he had a notion to drown himself. . .? 

Cox: No. That was - that were the master - Mack. 

Lomax: Oh. He wanted to drown. . .?
