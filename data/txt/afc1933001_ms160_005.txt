My dear Mr. Lomax,
In the absence of Mrs. Brandenburg 
with whom you have had previous
correspondence concerning a speaking 
engagement next April the ninth at the Worcester
Woman's Club. I have been asked to inform you
that because of limited funds we shall be
unable to comply with your request for expenses
from Washington. We are, however, prepared 
to meet the terms of the original agreement - 
that is, one hundred dollars ($100)
lecture fee plus travelling expenses from
New York.
Will you please let me know your decision
as promptly as possible so that if [we can?] any
we may make other arrangements for that
date?

Very truly yours,
Priscilla King Boora Eve
(Mrs. C. Pierson Boora Eve)

Woman's Club
