I'm proud of the stuff I've
found for the Archive. I expressed
you 50 records, and
will send another 100 in
a day or so. Tell Alan
I picked up the 50 sent to me
in Dallas.
Less and less I think you
will be troubled by "restrictions."
You seem to be going at the matter
sensibly and certainly very
liberally. I wrote to Alan to be
chary of Miss Jean Thomas. I 
keep hearing of her making trouble
Miss Terrill's diplomacy probably
kept me out of trouble
with her. Morris is a good
fellow, but seems "skeered" that
some mysterious person may
wrong him irreparably. Thank
goodness, Reed Smith is frank and
unsuspicious.
