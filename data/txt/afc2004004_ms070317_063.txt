Ain't but the one man I fear
That's the pullin George Miller &
he's not here.

Used to sing John Henry &
I rather hear him sing it than
eat.  I heard a fellow 
sing it in a steel mill in
Indiana.
Used to sing Stagolee
Used to sing & holler about
sundown in the evening.  I'd
go out there & lie out &
listen to 'em sing all kinds
stuff - that was when I was
a boy.
