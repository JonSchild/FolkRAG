GARY: 
You know all about New York, you understand. Nobody 
can tell you nothing about New York. 
LARRY: 
Right. 
GARY: 
And somebody had to tell you before you know. Something 
you had to experience before anybody could tell you for you know. I was standing on Madison Avenue once, and a fellow got a little 
bit more in him than he needs, that he could go home with 
you know, he decide to go in the hallway you know of an empty 
house there and lay down and sleep it off. About 25 other 
people gathered round him. He had on a good suit of clothes.
Pulled his shoes off, pulled off his socks, pulled his suit 
of clothes off, pulled off his shirt, necktie, pull of his draws 
Laying up there so buck naked as he ever was. When he come 
too, he said you understand Dogs were standing over there with sticks beaten on him, nearly killed your mighty body. What you doing 
there naked.  How could the man know how come he was like that. How could he know he, how come he like that. If you go to a persons 
house and they offered you just a quarter drink, you drink that, 
now that ain't gonna make you drunk, you understand. You find 
yourself just as dead to the world as you could be. Now you wonder 
why how come that made you drunk, you understand, when you used to drink more than that, you understand. 
LARRY: 
Yeah.
