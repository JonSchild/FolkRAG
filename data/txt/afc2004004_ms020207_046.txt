Reverend Roe.  Reel 10.  P. 3
And the conditions they have to live in? Doesn't that
make them susceptible to the Devil's --
R:  Well, its some [of them], they do.  There is some people that bad treat-
ments drives them nearer to God, and some it drives [them] um the other way.
[*Trust in God and your difficulties will disappear.*]
Because we [as good] who are Christians believe that the best thing we can do is
