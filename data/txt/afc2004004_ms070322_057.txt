of frenzy I drove myself ap & 
to work
Teeth, shave, exercise, an hour
of guitar & singing - have lunch,
then 2 1/2 hours of work on my
book. And I'll stick to at
least this every day. Short periods
of writing till it gradually becomes 
liked and familiar. Then more time
to do as I please. A new routine
Different approach towards work.
--Mor concentration
With more free time to look for
experiences & love. Try to do the
stupidly boring things as little
as possible. Clear focus on everything
I do. And do it well &
cleanly.
