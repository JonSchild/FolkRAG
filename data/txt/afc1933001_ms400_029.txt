Adventures of a Ballad-Hunter

"Boss", a Negro man once said to me, "Boss, do you know what
is the difference between a white man and a nigger?" "Well" I 
answered, "I think I know some differences; but tell me what you think."
"The principal difference is this" he replied, "when a white man talks
he talks with the back of his head; when a nigger man talks he talks with
the front of his head". What my Negro friend meant was that a white

seldom afford to be absolutely frank - always in the "back of his head"
he keeps unrevealed probably the most interesting remainder of his
thinking. In other words the average Negro tells you what he think you
expect him to say, not what he really thinks, not often showing you what
is in the "back of his head."

I have talked to many Negroes during the past two years in my

spread all over the sidewalks, so I just took what I needed."; they had
stabbed or shot in revenge against some one who was "messing up wid dere
homely affairs"; and they had sometimes killed a bystander. Allen
Prothere of Nashville, Tennessee, said to me: "Boss, I jus' got to
shootin' niggers and I couldn't stop." But they - these black men
and women in jail - among the aristocracy of the Southern Negro working
class - either resented the plenty of their former white masters and took
what they thought was rightfully theirs; or they had courage and a sense
