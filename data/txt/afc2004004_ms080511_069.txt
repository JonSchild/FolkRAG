A  (continued)
electric guitar.  That all happened in 15
years.  It was amazingly quick.  And suddenly
there, there was ah - there were several kinds
of country orchestra.

The most interesting of them all is the blue-grass
orchestra, built around ah, ah, an
advance on the banjo, where ah they developed
a - what they called a three finger roll,
where, where the fingers were playing - the
thumb engaged now and the two fingers playing
melody very fast.  Sometimes four fingers
engaged.  The inventor of this was ah, ah,
Ernest Scruggs, and I said:  Ernest, how did
you do it it?  (He was visiting me once in 
New York.)  And he said:  Well Alan, I just
got a feeling on the back porch, and I played
- I played and the days went by, I just
couldn't get it.  He said:  but finally one day
it come to me and I had it, and them fingers
began to go and I - that- they were just
rolling as smooth and as sweet notes of those
tunes was just coming out, and I run into
Mama, I said:  Mama, I've got it, I've got it!
And she said:  Yes son, you have.
