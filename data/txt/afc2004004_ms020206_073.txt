Reverend Roe.  Reel 6.  P. 6
A: Is there any name for [that that's] that as different from shouting?
R: They just happy, and that's the way they acts, you know.
A: [Of course] Course, some people would call that dancing.
R: Well now, people , I haven't see um say dance in [the] our service, I've seen [it done] um dancing in the
Holiness Chruch -- [they just] have music and they just all dance.
A: you think there's anything wrong with that?
R: Well, I don't think there's anything so sinful about it, if the people
[*very hesitant*]
you know, is si ncere, and yet it seems [a sin on account of] to set a kind a bad
[preacher there] precedent. I think that they have as much right to dance in the 
ballroom as they do in a church. I wouldn't advise it in my church.
However, if a person get happy, why, let [them] him shout. But I haven't yet
seen everybody in a church shout[ing at] the same time; I've [never] haven't
seen that, but I've se n in the Holiness Chruch all [the] those people dancing
at onetime.
