  1.  On one Sunday night in april,
Between nine and ten o, clock,
the Beautiful city of Tupelo
began to reel and rock.   
many people had returned from service.
and put their chilren to bed,
and less than seven minutes
Hundered of souls were dead.
           CHORUS 
Oh what a storm in Tupelo,
was heard of miles around.
What a storm in Tupelo,
so many people went down.

2.  The thunder began to roar,
Clouds hung very low,
Signs appeared in the Elements
they never had seen before.
The wind commenced blowing,
Began to uproot trees.
All over town people cried
Lord save me if you please.

3.   some of them started running.
and tried to make their escape:
But the dashing wind overtook them
and blew them in the lake.
many was killed by the storm
and quite a number drowned,
if the lake is ever drained
many more bodies may be found

4.  as buildings crumbled,
the lights went out
darkness all over town;
Men, Women, and children lie dying
on the ground.
the moans groans and helpless cries
were heard from everywhere,
dead men like small timber
were sailing through the air.

5.  it was a night of terror.
Very bad and sad
Thousands of men and women
lost every thing they had.
Many of them had no money.
food, shelter, nor clothes;
The storm having blown away their homes,
they have nowhere to go.

6.  Now Tupelo is a city,
Located in the Miss. hills
when it was visited by the storm
Many hundered people were killed.
God works in a mysterious was.
His wonders to proform
He maketh the cloud his chariod
And haves his way in the storm,

7.  Doctors, Medicine, and Nurses
were rushed there, it is said;
Undertakers, Embalmers, and hearses
were sent to bury the dead,
Hospitals were quickly established,
to care for the injured souls,
Homeless victims were given
Shelter, food and clothes.

8.  And you my dear young friends,
Who may this warning read
Tosilly, sly and flatering words
I pray you will never take heed.
But be a consistant christian
and live a righteous life,
And when the master calls
you may answer here am I.
