Dear Mr. Fisher:

Attached you will find a memorandum of various
expenses incurred by me in preparation of material for
the School of the Air programs. I feel that these are
definitely extra expenses which are not taken care of in
my weekly stipend. I believe my contract reads prepare
script material and this has amounted to my writing the
scripts. These have been used entire except for minor
corrections and cuts by Mr. Fineschriber. The preparation
of the material has entailed my missing many days from
my regular Jon at the library. Salary for these days has 
been deducted from my pay there. I feel I should be
reembursed at least for my expenses. I'd appreciate your
giving this your immediate attention.

I've been interested to hear of developments
for your Latin American program idea. With best wishes
for the holidays, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
