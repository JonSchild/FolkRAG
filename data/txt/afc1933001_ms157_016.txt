Mr. Alan Lomax--2                         May 20, 1940
Washington, D.C.

P.S. Since writing this letter NBC has called me that the European
situation has forced them to time your broadcast from 11:05 to 11:15.
This will mean that you will have about eight minutes instead of thirteen.
I am sorry but of course the change is unavoidable as far as
we are concerned.
