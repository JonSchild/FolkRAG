Professor John A. Lomax,
University of Texas,
Austin, Texas.

Dear Professor Lomax:

I am preparing an economic and social history of Texas for the years 1900-1940
which is to be published under the title TWENTIETH CENTURY TEXAS. I should like
your permission to include the following quotation from THE BOOK OF TEXAS, page
331:

Incapable, untrained, careless, often lazy, affected with
hookworm, eating poor food very badly cooked, living in
uncomfortable and crowded 'shacks,' victims of typhoid and
ignorance, and money lenders, these submerged tenants are the modern
representatives of the 'poor whites' of the Old South. The major
evils of tenantry are largely confined to this group and to the
Negroes and Mexicans.

Full credit will be given for the material in a footnote. Your kindness in
granting permission to quote will be greatly appreciated.

Yours very truly,
RW Steen
R.W. Steen

suppose the picture is still
accurate. I do not yet
feel that I know how to change
"Po' White Trash" into self-respecting
human units. I do feel that the improvement
must come from the inside
out and not from the outside in. F.*]
