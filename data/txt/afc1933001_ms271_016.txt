CARLSON'S RAIDER BAND
Tune: Ivan Skivinsky Skivar

The day it was Monday, the weather was hot,
Of August the seventeenth day;
We struck Makin Island, 'twas held by the Japs,
And this song will tell of the fray.

We were gathered from far and were gathered from near
And picked from the best in the land;
The peaceful Pacifica then roared with the guns
Of Carlson's bold raiding band.

We carried machine guns like pistols that day
And a knife that was tempered in hell;
And we always did claim no mortal by name
Could use them one quarter so well.

We fought through their traps and encircled the Japs,
And we cursed, "May your souls all be damned!
You've suffered the fate to meet face to face
With Carlson's bold raiding band!"

In the steam of the mud and the snakes and the bugs
We charged through the jungle's black heat,
We gambled with death, but we charged on and on,
With the Japs falling back in retreat.

You can sing of your cocktails and dreamy-eyed gals
And your playboys and cowards that run!
But Carlson's bold raiders, we'll sing for ourselves!
It's by fighting that freedom is won!

So, here's to a raider who stands by his flag
And offers his life to his land!
He walks through the jungle that's littered with death,
And he's proud of his bold raider band!

(This song was originally composed by an anonymous hand, possibly
right after the battle of the Jap-held Makin Island, August 17, 1942)
