Akron, Ohio
Nov. 4, 1937

Dear Harold,

I am sorry there has been this misunderstanding. 
I imagined from the number of times 
you mentioned Akron in your letters that 
you were very anxious for me to go there and 
already had secured the consent of the Librarian. 
Elizabeth has been ill for some time and I have 
felt criminal in keeping her in the field as long 
as I have, but we thought that we'd come by Akron 
to please you and father. Here we came and 
yesterday exhausted Cpt. Nye with thirteen records. 
But now, two weeks extension or no we are on our 
way home. Perhaps after I take E. to the doctor[s] 
we can go out again if you consider it important, 
but right now I am sick of record making, 
tired, and E. should not be kept out of town any 
longer. So expect us shortly after you receive
this note.

Yours.
Alan

I have written Dr. P. to
this same effect.
