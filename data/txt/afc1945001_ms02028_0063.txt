3. Iowa
October 12, 1942.
No. 2. A policeman who walks a beat - James L. Maguire, City Police Department,
Des Moines, Iowa.
Mr. Maguire is a well-educated, intelligent Negro plainclothesman assigned
to a shift in the Negro section beginning at 5 o'clock each evening. He is difficult
to get in touch with because of his irregular hours, so I have been unable yet
today to contact him, but I am inclosing the three sheets which he has so far mailed
to me. 
When Mr. Maguire was last in the office, he expressed complete willingness
to do the work but was inclined to feel a certain amount of futility on the basis
that "the Government knows how my people feel already." His viewpoint about the
treatment of the Negro in the present war situation was finally summarized in such
a fashion as this: "We people are hoping that the war will not be over in a year,
but rather will last three years, because in three years perhaps our progress in
gaining recognition of our capacities will be well enough established to be fairly
permanent, whereas in one year all our progress would be shortly lost." Mr. Maguire
repeated two rumors while he was in the office:
1. "I have a young friend who graduated from Iowa State College last June
as an engineer, and one of the divisions for which there are constant radio calls, and
he has been unable to make any progress in enlisting and is now to be drafted in
spite of the fact that his white co-graduates are all starting out with commissions."
2. "My son is in college in engineering now, but it probably won't do him
any good either. He will undoubtedly be drafted without any recognition of his
special qualifications."
3. "Every day I run into young fellows who are rebellious because they
are not allowed to enlist even though they have special qualifications, but must
be sent through the draft instead.
