was a rasp of harsh noise, rising above
the crowd. Women stood about and listened
and [sand] sang, learning the song. He would
sing a verse or two, then break off with 
a throaty chuckle to vend his wares. He
has been composing ballads "since the Titanic
went down." but in the middle of the street
Bowles Pub. Co. had a display of songbooks
and sheet arrangements - plugging modern gospel
hymns. On all the surrounding streets, little 
stalls selling ice cream, barbecue, watermelon,
chicken, pop beneath orange coal oil
lamps.
Had an interesting disc with a Rev from 
Indianola. He said that the halleys lost their
hold in 1920 + - when the Baptist broke
the power of the singing Conventions, then formed
and then independent of the Church The Church
began to plug gospel hymns after that and 
got their own singing conventions to use them 
- encouraging choirs, etc.. The halleys then became
the property of the quartets and the sanctified people
causing them to fall into [more & more] further disrepute
with the respectable Baptists - They clung faster
than ever to the already popular Dr. Watts [song?]
