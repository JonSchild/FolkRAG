Dear Dr. Putnam,

Perhaps an explanation of the siseable bill
from the Sound Specialties Company is forth coming, since it
was somewhat larger than the original estimates.
I enclose my copy with each item numbered
and shall forthwith explain the items one by
one, where explanation is called for.
1) The turntable unit(comprising the converter,
the turntble motor, the cutter and mechanism,
the pickup) had given a year and a half of service
under trying conditions without being
touched; it deserved a complete overhaul, greasing
and cleaning. The amplifier formerly consisted
of two parts. These were combined with
considerable saving in weight and with the addition
of power and better quality.
2) The new cutting head was an absolute essential
if I hoped to be able to record drum
music. The old cutter, as I had discovered in
the Bahamas, would not serve to record drum
music, and, since le tambour is the national instrument,
I though it best to take advantage
of the obvious improvement Thompson has made in
his cutters. I might add that the record I
have so far made are the best from the point
of view of quality and low surface noise I 
have ever made, that is, considering the accoustic
conditions.
