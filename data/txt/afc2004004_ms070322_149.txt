The Ball of Kirriemuir - where Bonnie
                                            was born.

In Angres. Between 1880 & present
Tune is older. The topical allusions are Boer
War. A sort of [Bottany?] ballad. Sung in
mixed company on farms. Some you
mightn't sing anywhere...

   Beings with the announcement of the 
ball - you have 5 or 6 strangers to choose
from. I'm hoping to publish a fairly
definitive edition with notes
