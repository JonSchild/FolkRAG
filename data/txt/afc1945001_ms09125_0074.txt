Jap sailor to his mother & father in Formosa:
Dear mother, 
Our nation has scored another great victory over 
the stupid amerikans. We catured a small island with 
53 U.S. Marines on it. The Impirial Nipponese Navy only 
lost 5 battleships, 16 destroyers, 3 aircraft carriers and 137 
aircraft. We were indeed victorious.
