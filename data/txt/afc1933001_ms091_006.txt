Dear Mr. Lomax:

Yours of 2-12 received, stating that you are coming here.
I live one mile North of town on the Fort Davis road, first house West of Dr. Pepper
Bottling Works. I hope you can bring your songs with you. I will like to look over
them. I once knew quite a number of them, but it seems that I have forgotten most
of it. But still remember one or 2 verses of several. But I am no singer, and at present
I can't recall anyone who can. Bill Splan of Missoula, Montana, is our president
for the International Cowboy Association of 80 and 90's. He and Chas. Harting
of Cody has the names of over 5,000 old cowboys. I have only 190 whom I have given
membership to, those two gentlemen might know of several who can sing. Also Ed Connery
of Douglas, Ariz. who is our Gen. Southern Range Boss over Okla., Tex., New Mex., Ariz.,
and Mex. has a large list of names, and knows many old cowboys. I am sure the Yellowstone
Newspaper at Billings, Mont. would help you, in fact I believe the entire Association
will be interested in your work. Chas. Harting, Cody, can give you over 5,000 names of
old cowboys. My Wagon Bosses for ICA are Bob Tyler of Marfa, Tex. might help you.
I can see you any time between 1 o'clock until the next morning. I work all night
and sleep from 7 in the morning to 12.
Will you please let me know as near as possible just what you want and
expect so I can be studying it over and practicing. It seems to me that "cattle calls" is not the proper name for it, but I don't know what other name could be used, I never
heard it spoke of by that by old cowboys. Cattle were never called till they went to
feeding, and trained to come; it seems to me that the hollowing you have in mind was for
a different purpose, and could not be spoke of as calls. I will help all I can but can
only hollow my way, the way I would hollow to rush them up, stop them, turn them, or quiet
them.

Yours, Sloan Matthews
West Tex. Range Ross for ICA

Alan: I think you ought to get complete look of all these people. My hand is too tired to write them. It would be a calamity  not to record Matthews. J. A. L.
