JOHN A. LOMAX
7456 SAN BENITO WAY
DALLAS, TEXAS
5/10/1940.

Dear Alan: May I remind you
that you are due Rogers an
acknowledgment of his unusual
kindness to you, and that
after I had figuratively slapped
him in the face some years
ago. I guess I'm responsible
for the letter he has sent to Davidson
Taylor, though fathers should
not express appreciation for
what they do for children I fish for no thanks. At best
this one human instinct is left
this morning as Germany crushes
Holland and Belgium.

Affectionately to my last breath
Father.
