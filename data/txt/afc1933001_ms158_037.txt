My dear Dr. Lomax:

Thank you for your recent note addressed to Miss Scott which she has asked
me to answer as I have been handling such matters. The pictures arrived in good
shape.

As yet we have not received the publicity material for the single sheet
printing that we discussed. We have been awaiting it anxiously as such a selling
piece does loads in booking some good dates. We have been definitely stymied
through not having it so far at a time when a lot of next season's business is
being booked.

I would be more than glad to write it up for you from the material that
we have on hand should you prefer that.

Please do let us go ahead this week. We would like to get the material
that you mentioned just as fast as you can send it.

Cordially yours,
Richard Erstein
