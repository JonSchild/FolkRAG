Mr. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

It was nice to hear from you again. I have not proposed any
trip yet because Alan has been using the Presto machine for recording
and duplicating constantly since his return. (The Thompson
machine is now practically useless). As soon as I can get hold of
the machine (or another one) I shall try to get it to you under the
best possible conditions.

Miss Densmore has already written me and I am doing what I can
for her.

You should know by now that I never grow weary of the Lomaxes.
In spite of any complaints you may ever have heard from me, I really
find working with the Lomaxes a delightful experience.

Best regards to all,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
