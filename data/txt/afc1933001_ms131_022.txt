With reference to the attached bills and memoranda:

1) Verbal authorization was secured from the Superintendent of Buildings in both cases.

2) In the case of the Capital Radio Wholesalers, it was ascertained that this dealer was the only one in Washington who carried the particular type of equipment necessary and the purchase was authorized verbally by the Superintendent of Buildings before the order was placed. The mistake I seem to have made was in ordering the material myself instead of letting the order come through the Superintendent's office. At the time, however, I did not understand that this was the wrong procedure. No one, before that time, had ever informed me that such procedure was incorrect and I had been accustomed to having the machine repaired in the field on my own initiative. 

3) In the case of the bill from Mr. Fred Kohl, the Superintendent authorized me verbally to call Mr. Kohl in for repair work on the Archive's recording equipment when I had told him that Mr. Kohl had estimated his charges would be in the neighborhood of three dollars. As the repair work progressed, however, the equipment, which has seen several years of hard service in the field, developed more and more defects and it was only after several consulting technicians had volunteered their suggestions and after some ten or twelve nights of work by Mr. Kohl that the equipment was finally repaired. I submit that it was impossible for either Mr. Kohl or myself to forsee that these difficulties would arise and that Mr. Kohl has presented a very reasonable bill, since in point of fact he spent twice as much time on the equipment as he estimates in his bill.
