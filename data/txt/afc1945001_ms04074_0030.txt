"I wouldn't pay too much attention to price ceilings. They 
are going to change it all anyway. President Roosevelt is working outa 
new system for us, one that's a honey, and if it don't work they will try 
something else. Pretty soon we will all be out of business if this keeps 
on." (San Francisco - Agusut 5th. Businessman)
