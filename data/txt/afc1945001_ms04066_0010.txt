"What about all these Japs running around Salt Lake -- at night, 
I mean. Three of them sat right alongside of me at the ball game last night 
and it was after eleven before the game broke up. They weren't Chinks, 
either. These were Japs! I know Japs when I see 'em. Thought they had a 
curfew on 'em."  [*Salt Lake City 8-6  21*]
