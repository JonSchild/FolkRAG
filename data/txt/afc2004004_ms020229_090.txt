BJ TAPE 15, p. 87

didn't, ah, know what she meant.  She sho' tol' us in the, ah,
Sun'ay school?  Ya know, she was a, uh, a Mother, you know.  I say
a Mother a the Church; she musta been 'cause she be there at all
times, at Sunday School.  An' she would show us that, them two mens on
each side a, pitchur a Christ?  What they got for Christ, at least.
They show us them people, them two men?  An' tell us 'bout that.
But we didn' understand then -- least I didn't understand it until
longs years after that when I began to go to churches an' hear preachin'
an' see into it.  Those, those two men was robbers.
TL:  You mean on the cross?
BJ:  Um-hum.  Yes, they was robbers.  An' the time when Joseph,
Joseph an' Mary had to flee to Egypt when Jesus was, you know,
to keep Sol-Solomon from killin' the peoples -- killin' him?
'Cause that wasn't to keep him, but they Chri-- God told 'em to go,
to Egypt, you know, an' stay 'till He tell 'em to come back.
Well, when they went, ya know, they was robbers was in those days,
too, like they is now.  They jus' steal an' rob -- highway robbers,
jus' like it is now.  Ain't nothin' new.  An', but anyhow, they went
on and these same robbers, ah, ah, when they was comin' back the
two years, time they come back?  When He told 'em to come back?
Well, these robbers was, uh, was, uh, hel-helt them up.  Helt up
Joseph an' Mary, see?  An' one a the robbers told the other one,
"Let's don't," not, not to take their food.  Known, know, they
took their food an' they frangiments (FRANKINSENSE?), you know,
the things they used to have to sell an' all, all that kinda
stuff.  But they didn't have ah, nothin' to sell, ya know?  But
they, but they were gonna take they food.  An' the one of
the man spoke an' told 'em ta, not to take it 'cause they had a 
baby.  You know.  Because they had a lil' baby.
