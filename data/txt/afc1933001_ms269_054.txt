reviews of immigrant life and attitudes as reflected in
their press.  During the past year, in the Library of Congress
WPA Project, we have been making a check list of foreign-language
press holdings in the United States and a supplementary
selected list of secondary sources.

1. General subject matter of materials.

a. Old World backgrounds. Peasant or small town
derivation of the bulk of our immigrant population -
native customs, habits, prejudices, inhibitions,
outlooks, as a result of poverty, suppression, discrimination,
isolation etc. - skilled crafts and
service occupations - middle-class elements -
minority group derivation (note: members of an immigrant
group may be drawn from several distinct regions, as
the Greeks who come from Old Greece, Old Turkish
Empire, Egypt, Cyprus, Russia etc., with differing
cultural traits and attitudes.)

b. Migration and settlement. Emigration from Europe,
Orient, Latin America - causes (economic, religious,
political) - methods of recruiting and transportation
to America - migration within the country - settlement,
involving shifting foreign quarters in cities and the
displacement of native stock in rural areas - migration
across our borders to Canada, Latin America, or back
to the old country.

c. Geographical distribution. Main immigrant and
nationality groups, their numbers and distribution -
lesser groups - distribution by state - regions of high
concentration, rural and urban - relation to general 
trend of population from rural areas to industrial
centers.

d. Labor relations. Earning a living, including occupational
distribution, special skills and crafts, early handicaps
in work - mass production and unskilled immigrant labor -
rivalry in labor market between earlier and more recent
groups - conflict between a major nationality group in
an area and smaller groups - planned segregation of
nationality groups in industrial areas - displacement
of leadership in trade unions -- survival of hostility
toward a group as a result of old strike-breaking -
survivals of old labor ideologies and new trends -
varying responses toward unionization among different
groups.
