July + Oct 1942
Heard in Corvallis
from relatives who have
former neighbors working in
Seattle ship yards.
Workers are sent on
errands to get something
+ as much as 2 or 3 hours
of their time is wasted
before they are given some
simple thing. This is
common practice, grossly
impeding war efforts.
This rumor comes from
3 different sources.
