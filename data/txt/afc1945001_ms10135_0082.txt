For the black man here's a Toast
For the gun That he shall carry
And the Skull cap on his hair

And be sorry he was ever born.

II.
Two Negro men, one an educated gentleman
another an educated fool, were walking one day for pleasure.
Educated Gentleman:  Well Johnson, What's your view of the war situation and yourself?
. . Fool: Well, Sir, my view is just like Hitler's view.
. . Gentleman: just like Hitler's view? What do you mean?
. . Fool: Well it's just like this: I was a fool before it started, and when it ends I'll still be a fool.
