Who from the fox-holes rose at night? 
Who with knives at each rifle tip, 
Hard steel bayonet, there to rip, 
Killed for country, in soft moonlight? 
Mac Arthur's men! 
Who found glory in death out there? 
Who crawled dying, slow, through the 
mud? 
Who spelled freedom in life's own 
blood, 
For us giving all, not just a share? 
Who will live when the war's no more, 
Live eternal in heart, in mind, 
Live when the peace is made and signed? 
Whose names will ring from shore to shore 
Mac Arthur's men!
