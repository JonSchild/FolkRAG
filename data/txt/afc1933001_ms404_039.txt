10  [6]

God told Norah for to sketch his plan
"Gonna buid me a nicer world."
An' says-a, "What you gonna do today, good Lord?"
"'m gonna prove it to the world 'm God of all power,
Godallmighty open, no man can shut 'n,
Godallmighty shut 'n no man can open 'n
Godallmighty ask 'n no man can answer."

Tending to the flood ----
Well, 'way East, he was sending one angel,
Well, 'way North, he was sending one angel,
Well, 'way South, he was sending one angel,
Well, 'way West went six angels.
"Well I want you to hold up the vaults of the sea
Let the water come down just like a flood;
Well, six angels,
I want you to hold up the vaults of the sea,
Let the water [bi] billow up like a mountain.
Well, fourth angel,
Well, third angel,
Well, second angel,
Well, first angel,
I want you to gather up the little pieces of scattering clouds
Drive them in a solid mass to the sea----"

Says, water is rising,
Says, water is falling,
Says, water got up by the sills of the door[way],
Says, they went up to the upper floor,
Says, when they got there,
Says the water was there,
Says they couldn't go no higher,
Says, then they looked our and seen the ark coming
They had called the old man a fool about,
Well, they begin to sing and cry- --
Says, "O Norah,
Let your ark sail, sail thisaway, please."
He says, "No, no,
Remember one hundred and twenty years ago,
Says, told you this time would be,
Says, called me a fool all over this land,
But today I'm bound to the [kind] kingdom land,

Where you bound?
I'm bound
Kingdom land.
Where you bound?
I'm bound
Kingdom land.
