August 5 â€“ The following comment was overheard in the Omaha Post
Office.....two middle-aged men were talking:  "There's too much delay and red
tape in our form of Government.  It's wonderful in peace time, but I'm wondering
if it's so good in war, and especially in a war such as we are in now. [*13*]
The saboteurs should have been shot right now instead of all this messing around."
