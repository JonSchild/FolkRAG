Dear Gene:
Here is something I learned from my son, age six. 
You will recall the old rhyme â€” 

"Eenie, meenie, minie moe 
Catch a nigger by the toe 
If he hollers let him go 
Eenie, meenie, minie moe."

Here is the latest version of it --

"Eeenie, meenie, minie moe 
Catch a Jap by the toe 
If he hollers make him say 
I surrender, U S A!"
I hope the Regional Analysts dig up something for 
you.

Very truly yours,
Jack
