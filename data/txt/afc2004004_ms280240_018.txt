(Jimmy what do you do about women on your travels - don't you
ever onto a girl friend with all these songs?)
Oh well, I once got hooked on with a girl. It was in...it was
in North Berwick, North Berwick...That's Berwick-upon-Tweed.
It was North Berwick. There was three or four girls in that
public house, with that feller and, of curse, that feller that
was travelling along l'me, wasna very...keen on girls somehow
[*oh*]
or other, but I was, I was full of venom that time too and, of
course, these girls come around me and they sid doon aside me
and they said, "Well, Jock," they said, "What about a drink?"
I says, "Oh," I says, "You'll get a drink alright." She says
to me, she says, "You know," she says, "What are you doing," she
says. "Are you in the road?" "Im in the road." She says,
"What about coming along with you." "Och," I says, "I don't
mind," I says, "But," I says, "Where d'you stay. Your people
will be.....very, very hungry coming alongwith me." "Oh,"
she says, "I'll, I'll come along the roadwith you." So...
"Och," I says to meself, I says, to her, "It's just as
good as beingmarried then, in that case." I says, "We don't
need to get special licence in that case." "No, no"she says
she says, 
"You can just say that you're married noo." So...
we went along the road, and of course that other feller was
left behind - I left him behind. I was very sorry to leave
him behind, he was a nice feller. But this girl....I could'nt
tell with this girl and of curse there was'nt....she was very,
very red in the hair and.....oh she was red-headed, oh, she was
awful red headed that girl - terrible - she had got fiery hair.
