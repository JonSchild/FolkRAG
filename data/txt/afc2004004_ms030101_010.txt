least the first I have seen -
to contain the melodies of
(new column)
alike, but changes rhythm,
pitch and intervals as blas
may dictate.  In most cases, 
Haufrecht has notated only 
Jackson's performance of the 
first stanza, which is the cor-
rect procedure, unless one 
has the space, a la Bartok, to
notate every last variation,
for the first stanza usually
provides the essential form 
of the tune as it lingers in the 
singer's mind.
   Such notations are ex-
tremely valuable, since they
clarify the general shape of 
the melody. They are equally
valuable in clarifying the
structure of the melody, but
concerning this, unfortunate-
ly, Goldstein says nothing at
all.  A glance at his booklet 
reveals an overwhelming 
preference for triple meters,
which is a cowboy character-
fistic; it also reveals that most
of the tunes are in gapped
scales, particularly the hexa-
tonic; that despite the sing-
er's almost exclusive deli-
ance on the major, there are
hints, implications, and side
glances at other modes; and
(new column)
is largely English and Irish.
As the title of her record,
False True Lovers, suggests,
her emphasis in this collec-
ion is on lyric songs and on 
ballads of desertion and 
pathos, but she also presents 
some ballads and songs on
livelier and happier themes.
Her style is the quietest,
simplest, subtlest in all the
world; it is completely folk-
loric, but with a delicacy, a
refinement, and fragility all
her own.  Accompaniments,
on guitar and banjo, are
provided by the singer her-
self and by several collaborative-
orators, and these also are
very beautiful.
   There is something unique
here - a kind of sophistica-
ion that comes from within
a folk style - which has no
exact parallel among Ameri-
