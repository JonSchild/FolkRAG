A joke about the War (indirectly)

About two weeks before the rationing
of canned foods & etc. A middle aged
woman was shopping at her neighborhood
store. She brought as much
of the ration-to-be food as her
money would let her. After she
had ordered all her groceries, the
grocer said in a curious way, "aren't 
you buying quit[e] a lot for your
small family?" and she returned
with a quick answer, "oh, I want to
get in before those awful hoarders."
