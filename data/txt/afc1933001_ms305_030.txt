EXPERIMENT AT HIGHLANDER

THOSE who remember when
Pearl White was queen of the movies
and Vitagraph and Kalem were
mighty names in the industry, will
recall the sagas of red-blooded romance
that immortalized the Cumberland
region in the thrillers and
tear jerkers of yesteryear.

But history can beat fiction in
melodrama, and in the history of the
folk the people of the Cumberlands
have a past of greater meaning in
the light of contemporary struggles
than the moonshiner tradition. Tracy
City, Coal Creek - those are names
big in labor history. Like Lexington
and Bunker Hill. Back in the days
when the Knights of Labor were
marching, at night in the dark of the
moon, the miners advanced on the 
coal camps at Tracy City and Coal
Creek, and tied up the guards and
set the convicts free. And that was the
end of convict labor in the mines of
Tennessee.

But today these lean Anglo-Saxons
whose speech still echoes the idiom
of Chaucer and Sir Philip Sidney do
not know much about romance or
drama as popularly understood. They
are having too hard a time to live.
They do not work in the mines as
their grandfathers did, Tennessee coal
is played out, the mines are shut.
They do not farm the land, the land
is washed out and unfit to make a
living. In Grundy County anyhow
most of it is owned by Tennessee
Coal and Iron, and the Monteagle
Association. In the good old way,
T.C.I. bought up land at ten cents an
acre and leased it to the railroads
and other private interests who cut
out the big timber. Now it is leased
to the "bugwood" people who are
getting what's left, the little stuff

mostly unfit even to burn, used for
making alcohol and chemicals. Ex-farmers
have a hard time to raise
bees any more, the "bugwood" cutters
have destroyed the wild flowers
and the bees starve to death! Take a
walk through the "bugwood" areas
back in the mountains, you can go
for miles looking out over the top
of the brush, the sky close overhead.
Not a tree, of more size than blackjack
oak.

What do they do for a living, besides
taking out a little bootleg coal? 
Most of them are on relief, and waiting
for something to happen.

Grundy County is the poorest
county in Tennessee, with a population
of 10,000, eighty per cent of
whom are unemployed. In addition
to those who have been jobless over
a period of years since the mines
closed down this appalling figure includes,
also, farmers who have had 
to go on relief and are classed as unemployed.
Practically all of them,
100% strong, are organized in the
Workers Alliance, and the man most
responsible for this is Dillard King.
Six feet, underfed, quiet-voiced,
twenty-nine years old, Dillard King
was born in Monteagle and two years
ago, came as a student to the Highlander
Folk School.

Nine years ago Myles Horton, an
energetic young Tennessean, graduate
of a little backwoods Presbyterian
college, came back from studying cooperatives
in Denmark. He was determined
to do something for the
honest American's in his community
who were out of work, not because
they were lazy, but because the profit
system couldn't give them jobs. With
help from a small group of Southern
liberals, educators and church leaders,

the Highlander Folk School was
established. "Some people object to
our use of the name 'Folk School,'"
Myles Horton said with his engaging
smile. "We think it's the right one,
going back to the original meaning.
The folk are the people. And our
school belongs to the people!"

It certainly does. It is a community
center for all of Grundy County. As
a labor school, it keeps in touch
with trade union organizers and other
progressive leaders who come from
all over the South and the United
States to take part in its regular
school term. It has sponsored a Community
Council to deal with local
problems of health, public schools,
planning for recreational and co-operative
undertakings to affect the
general standard of living. One of the
Council's most flourishing projects is
a day nursery with a trained person
in charge, for the children of local
mothers who go out to work during
the summer season when the influx
of tourists provides temporary employment.

When the League of American
Writers was asked to take its New
York school down to Highlander last
summer and put on a Workshop for
Student Writers it was a brand new
experiment, the first time the League
had ever been south of Washington.
The students came from all around 
and from every walk of life - an
office worker from New Orleans, an
ex-coal miner from Arkansas, a TVA
employee from Knoxville; from the
Illinois coal fields, the Iowa farm
district, the universities of Cincinnati
and Kentucky, and from Chattanooga
only fifty miles away. All
were there to learn the technique of
writing. But to some of these young
