Mme. S. Comhaire

New York, N.Y.

Dear Mme. Comahire:
Mr. Lomax has not yet returned 
from his field trip. He was scheduled
to arrive tomorrow, but I have not heard
from him in more than a week, so I cannot
say for certain whether he may be delayed
for several days.

I shall call your letter to his
attention as soon as he returns.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant,
