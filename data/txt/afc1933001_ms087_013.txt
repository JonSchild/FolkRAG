and provided for pensions and in-
surance. They made it possible for
each staff member to make at least
one medical inspection tour a year
at the Clinic's expense.
    Despite a high proportion of pa-
tients treated free or at cost, by
1915 the brothers had accumulated
$1,500,000. With this sum, later
increased to $2,800,000, they en-
dowed the Mayo Foundation for
Medical Education and Research
at the University of Minnesota.
"The money came from the people,"
Dr. Will declared, "and it should
go back to the people." Dr. Charlie
called the fund "the contribution
of the sick of this generation to
prevent sickness and suffering in 
the next." Dr. Will even turned
over his home as a meeting place

for men of medicine, and moved
into a smaller house.
    On the day in 1929 that Dr.
Charlie performed his last opera-
tion, a son, Dr. Charles William
Mayo, performed his first operation
as a Clinic surgeon. Today, he alone
carries on the family name at the
Clinic. Drs. Will and Charlie died,
two months apart, in the summer of
1939.
    The Mayo tradition, which has
attracted more than a million pa-
tient and made Rochester the medi-
cal crossroads of the world, is perhaps
best characterized by a favorite
motto framed on Dr. Will's desk:
"If you do one thing well, though
you dwell in the midst of a forest
the world will beat a path to your
door."
