I guess I slept there a couple of hours.  When I woke up I was feeling pretty
good. Didn't have no bath tubs or nothing like they got now.  She
was fixing me some water on a number three wash tub. And I got in there and
took my bath and I went to bed.

My daddy got up the next morning. He went to ----- up the mules 
and brought them back and I was up by the time he got back.

AL: How old were you then?

WB: then I must have been 9 years old. And they started filling in that hole
where the drag line was. Filling in where I was hauling milk and stuff to.
They had finished the job, but they had to cut a hole in the levee for
the drag line to go through, so they could take it to the river and load
it on the barge. Mr. Winn he had come and he had that old style car.
He lost a lot of money on the place he was renting in Louisiana. He
started and he got that contract for filling up that hole.

I always wanted to be a man. I did pretty good. I didn't get hurt.
But I saw them flips, throw them over between the mules. The mules ran
off and drag them and hurt them bad. But I was lucky not to get in
there after being so mannish and wanting to be a man. All right then.
I got up there and we finished that. I had pretty good money.

My mother was named Lily but Mrs. Dyer called her Livinia. She said, "Why don't
you give me that boy and let me learn him something."

AL: Who was Livinia, exactly?
