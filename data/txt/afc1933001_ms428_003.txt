Oh, Dear, What Can the Matter Be?
(English)

Oh, Dear, What Can the Matter Be?
Dear! dear! What can the matter be?
Oh! dear! What can the matter be?
Johnny's so long at the fair.

1. He promised he'd buy me a beautiful 
fairing,
A gay bit of lace that the lassies 
are wearing,
He promised he'd bring me a bunch of
blue ribbons
To tie up my bonny brown hair.
and it's etc.

2. He promised he'd buy me a basket of
posies,
A garland of lilies, a wreath of red
roses,
A little straw hat to set off the 
blue ribbons,
That tie up my bonny brown hair.
And it's etc.

My Banjo (Italy)
Tra-la-la-la-la, my banjo is saying,
Tra-la-la-la-la, to sound of my playing
Tra-la-la-la-la, old friends are the 
dearest
Come, my banjo, we'll sing to them all.

Tra-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la, the dancers are swaying
Tra-la-la-la-la, to sound of my playing,
Tra-la-la-la-la, old friends are the
dearest,
Come, my banjo, we'll sing to them all.

Weggis Song (Swiss Hiking Song)

From Lucern to Weggis on
Hol-di-ri-di-a, hol-di-ri-a,
Hats and knapsacks we will don,
Hol-di-ri-di-a, hol-di-a.

Refrain
Hol-di-ri-di-a, 
Hol-di-ri-di-a, hol-di-ri-a.
Hol-di-ri-di-a, 
Hol-di-ri-di-a, hol-di-a.

Follow the Gleam
To the knights in the days of old
Keeping watch on the mountain height,
Came a vision of Holy Grail
And a voice thro' the waiting night.

Refrain:
Follow, follow, follow the gleam,
Banners unfurled o'er all the world,
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Of the Chalice that is the Grail.

And we who would serve the King
And loyally Him obey,
In the consecrate silence know
That the challenge still holds today.

Refrain: 
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Standards of worth o'er all the earth,
Follow, follow, follow the gleam
Of the light that shall bring the dawn.

Tiritomba (Italy)
When the mountain top through purple
mist is glowing
And the wood faint green is showing,
When with merry ripple all the brooks
are flowing
Then must I be on my way.
Tiritomba, tiritomba, all the work is
calling, calling to me so.
Tiritomba, Tiritomba, Tiritomba, I must go.

When the morning dew is still on petal
clinging
And the lark his song is singing,
O'er my shoulder stick and bundle gaily
slinging,
To the road I take my way.
Tiritomba, Tiritomba, with my lusty song
The countryside will ring,
Tiritomba, Tiritomba, Tiritomba, I must 
sing.

O'er the mountain trail we'll go
Hol-di-ri-di-a, hol-di-ri-a
See the deep ravines below,
Hol-di-ri-di-a, hol-di-a
