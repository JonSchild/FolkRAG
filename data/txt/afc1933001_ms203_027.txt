Memo to Dr. Spivacke,

The Columbia Broadcasting Company has asked me to 
supervise their musical program on the American School of the
Air during its next season of twenty-four weeks, beginning
October 10th and ending the second or third week in May. According
to the present plan I am to act as advisor on script,
commentator and in some cases singer on this program. The series
is designed to reach school children during school hours and
I am told it goes to  more than 120,000 classrooms across the 
whole country on their coast-to-coast hook-up. It provides, I
feel, at once a rare opportunity for stimulating a general
interest in American folk-song, but also will create a situation
in which the Archive of American Folk Song can begin at once to
play a vital role in American culture. I might add that it is
planned to commission twenty-two of America's leading composers
to write brief works especially for presentation over this program.
I am naturally delighted at this opportunity to do a
creative and at the same time authentic piece of work, and, since
I feel that my participation in the program would not injure the
future of the Archive but on the contrary enrich it, I feel
justified in asking for a certain amount of leave without pay
during the season of the broadcast. This leave should not extend
over  more than two days a week during the actual broadcast and
in all likelihood,after a certain routine has been established,
the day of the broadcasts , themselves, will prove to be sufficient
leave.
