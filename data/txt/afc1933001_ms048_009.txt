My dear Miss Dennis

Mr. John A. Lomax has asked me to notify you 
that your recent request for information about the song, 
"Thatcher Perkins was the builder of the 49" is receiving 
his careful attention.

Mr. Lomax's reply has been somewhat delayed, owing 
to his recent field trip to Texas.  Upon his return to the 
Library this week, however, he referred your inquiry to an 
authority on Missouri folk-music, Professor  H. M. Belden, of 
the University of Missouri, from whom he hopes to receive a 
reply in the very new future.

Very truly yours,

[Secretary]
