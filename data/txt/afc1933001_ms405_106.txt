I am a jolly shanty boy
As you will soon discover;
To all the dodges I am fly,
A hustling pine woods rover.
A peavy hook it is my pride,
An ax I well can handle;
To fell a tree or punch a bull,
Get rattling Danny Randall.

Bung yer eye: bung yer eye.

I love a girl in Saginaw,
She lives with her mother;
I defy all Michigan,
To find such another,
She's tall and fat, her hair is red,
Her face is plump and pretty;
She's my daisy Sunday best-day girl,
And her front name stands for Kitty.

Bung yer eye; bung yer eye.

I took her to a dance one night,
A mossback gave the bidding,
Silver Jack bossed the shebang,
And Big Dan played the fiddle.
We danced and drank the live long night,
With fights between the dancing-
Till Silver Jack cleaned out the ranch,
And sent the mossbacks prancing.

Bung yer eye; bung yer eye.
