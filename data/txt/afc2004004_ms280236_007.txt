Come haul down those French colours and hoist up the red, white
                                                                                 and blue,
We'll drink success to the broadside fire, we'll instantlye sink
                                                                                 you. 

Barman: Order please, ladies and gentlemen. I will now call
on our friend Mr. C.P. just to oblige with a small ditty. 

Cyril Poacher sings The Country Boy in London.
1) It was down in Northamptonshire where I heard of various news,
All the shams and fancies of mighty London Town.
So I took it into my head one day, to travel that place to see,
I'm a young man from the country but I'm far too wide awake.
Chorus: Repeat last line.
2) As I stared down the shop window at a handsome chain and a golden locket,
A London chap behind me stood, shoved his hand into my pocket,
Says I, "Young man, your hand is in the wrong place, and you're
                                                          making it rather free,
I'm a young man from the counteree, but you won't pickpocket me."
3) And another chap stepped up to me, and swore that he would nick it
He said, "Young man, I've pawned my watch, and I want to sell the ticket,
So I kept a sharp watch on his game, and soon I showed he,
I'm a young man from the counteree but you can't ticket me.
4) Now up stepped a dashing lady and by my side did keep,
Her cheeks were all dabbed up with paint just like we mark our sheep,
Saying, "Here's a shilling for thee, lad,"and she offered one to me,
I'm a young man from the counteree but you can't old soldier me.
