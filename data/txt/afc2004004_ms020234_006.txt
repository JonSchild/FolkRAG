an' cows an' [hosses] hawgs she had, you know.  An', an' this's a beautiful
place.  The flo' was clean enough to eat off of, ya know, 
all the time.  But they scrub with that potash an' [them] that an' them
mops?  Boy, that was a beautiful place in there.  'S so clean.
Start from the steps on up, jus' as pretty as it could be. 
       So. An' ah, my daughter an' I was there, ya know.  Like I
put some glasses up where they don't due to be?  "Mama don't
want this here."  Yet she hadn't called me anything, ya know?  Just,
you know what I mean, no name or n-- no, no kinda...I hadn',
I didn' tell 'er who I was.  You know what, what I mean?  I know
she know me, but, you know...I assume -- She hadn't said "Bessie,"
she hadn't said "Mama," she hadn't said nothin'.  I didn't know
what she was gonna say; I didn't tell 'er.  Said to myself, "I

       So I put [stuff] sumthin' up where Mama don' due to put it.  "Mama

you, poor soul                ."   Said to myse'f, you know.  All
right, she...I let her go on an' do it.  From one thing to the
other.  Mama had a pet 'coon in the yard, ya know.  An' if I
give the 'coon sumpin' that, that Mama don't give 'im, "Mama
don't give Nixie that."  Ya know?  Or, "Mama don't want Nixie to
have that." An' she, an', when she said that, she movin', she takin' it
away.  I let, I let all that pass up.  Go on.  From time to time.   Mama
have certain place to [set] put a broom. If I set it in diffrunt
places, "Mama don't want a broom set there.  Mama want a broom
here."
        Very nice.  "Oh? Okay."  Go ahead on.  So I was rockin' on
