We, at Powers, believe that there will be no more opportune
moment to purchase your Fall and Winter Coat than NOW,
during the month of July! It is no secret that the rumor of
a shortage of 100% wool fabrics may soon become an actuality! 
TODAY we urge you to choose now, to LOOK AHEAD,
to an uncertain future, when the value of these truly fine
coats will be greatly appreciated! LOOK AHEAD to making
a wise investment when you choose a beautiful coat at
Powers were good quality costs no more!
