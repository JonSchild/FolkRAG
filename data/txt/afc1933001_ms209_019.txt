for this book to include the words
and music of the best French 
stuff from Louisiana and at 
least a few of the Spanish
songs. Some of the material I got 
from the Spanish lady in Dallas
might do. Also, if you
agree, some of the typical 
tunes you found in the 
West Indies could go and 
their presence be indicated by 
a subtitle to the volumne.
Were it possible to print 
along with the text material 
English translations, the book 
would have a wider appeal
as something different to 
Ballads #1 and also a step 
forward. If possible, please 
arrange, in case you approve, 
for all or some part of this
job to go forward at [orce] once.
