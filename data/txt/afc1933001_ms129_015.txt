Dear Sirs:

   The package I received this morning contained
not the motor belt which I ordered, but the turn
table fly wheel.  I hope that you will send me the
part that I ordered at once, that is, the belt to
connect the pulley of the motor with the fly wheel
of the turn table.

   I am in urgent need of this belt and will appreciate
all the dispatch possible.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge
