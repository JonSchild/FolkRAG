got no job.  And if you was loading by the car, they pay you
60 cents for a car, and when they got the union, this car
weighed, level full, weighed 8100 lbs.
But for 60 cents a car you had to buy your own powder. And they
had an iron thing, put across here, with posters up like
this, on each side of the track at the dump, and welded a
key (?) rail across the top of them, and it was about that
high above the top of your car.  And if that coal didn't clear
. . . .the top of this t-rail, and rake it back over your car,
they'd dock you a car, and when they docked you, they took
half of the car, 30 cents.  That's the kind of people they was then.
That's why it was so hard for the union, it was that way all
the way through Hoover administration, when he come in.
And if they had stuff, I called it a soup line the other day,
they get stuff, sheets, and clothes and potatoes, they'd put
that in a room somewhere and sold it. . . .Yeah.  And this cabbage
and stuff, they'd have to keep. . . women would cry for it,
that didn't have no husband and children.  And they'd tell her,
we didn't have your children for you.  That's our stuff and 
they'd keep it there til they get rotten, stink.  They'd take
it out and throw it over the riverbank. . . .over in a fishing
hole over in Williams. . . . They done that, Lord, how much
they done that.
AL:  So when the government sent down relief, they wouldn't
give it to you. . . .
