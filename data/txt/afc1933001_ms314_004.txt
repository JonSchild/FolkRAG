ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH BALLADS. 3

necessary fight, fair in trade, loyal in love, generous to the poor, tender in the household, prudent in living, plain in speech, merry upon occasion, simple in behavior, and honest in all things." But if our American versions are not collected quickly they can never be collected at all. It is now or never, Many influences are tending to obliterate them. Catchy, but empty, songs not worthy of comparison with them, the decadence of communal singing, the growing diversity of interests, the appeal to what is divisive and separative in our national life, the presence of the artificial and self-conscious in modern writing are depriving our homes and schoolrooms of a kind of literature which, for community of feeling, for vigor of narrative, for vividness of portraiture, and for utter simplicity of style and content is not surpassed in the whole history of English and American song.
     How you can help.--You can help by using the inclosed envelope to say whether you know any of these 305 ballads or know of them. Perhaps there is a pupil in your school, or a parent, or a patron, or a friend not connected with the school who knows, or is likely to know, several of them. The report even of a fragment will be welcome. You will be surprised to find that many versions of these old songs are at your very door or may be obtained by a little effort and tact. You are not asked to write down and send on any versions of these ballads. It is desired to know, first, how many of these ballads and how many versions of the same ballad there are in each State. It is believed that the public school teachers are perhaps better fitted than any others to inaugurate a national search, but the cooperation of all into whose hands this circular may fall is earnestly requested. When the returns from the different States have been received and classified, another circular in hand each State in which there is no folklore or ballad society can form one on a definite basis of ascertained results, and thus continue the search. Those States or communities that already have such societies can use the information thus acquired in whatever way they deem best. State organizations will be found most efficient in this rescue work. Not until each State feels itself responsible for the collection of the ballads surviving in its own borders will the search be even approximately complete or the results at all satisfactory. But when each State joins in a sort of cooperative ballad union, a work may be written that shall prove not less significant and certainly not less interesting to Americans than Prof. Child's great work itself.
     The complete list.--Here are the titles in alphabetical order of the 305 English and Scottish ballads collected and numbered by Prof. Child, his numbering being retained. The different names under which some of these ballads go are given in parentheses. The starred ballads are those that have been found in one or more versions in the
