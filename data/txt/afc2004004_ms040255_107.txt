16  -6 -  Rough trans

Did you hear about the beautiful maiden
Who was raped by fairhaired neal
by the side of a rut on a Sunny day
It's a pity o lord that it wasn't I 
I wd not tear the front of your shirt
If I did I myself would sew it
With small needle & a white thread
And I would work it in a wet stream
[And] Standing on a rock with the stream
                                  bubbling round
I wd dry it on the tree
I wd then iron it & hand it to you
It's a pity that & the yg [have] stalwart
weren't at thtop of the green net
with no one near us, surrounded by
              heathers & rough undergrowth 
We wd come home together just as if
   we had been married at the altar
O that you & I my love were on a 
sea island [that wd] where the tide
       wd not ebb
Without anybody being able to cross
                          over to us
Until the sun rises next day
