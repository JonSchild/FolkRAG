RUMORS -- VOLUME, NATURE AND SOURCE.

ALABAMA

Rumor is current that if FSA is continued farms
will be confiscated and turned over to the Negroes.
Petitions are being circulated in all counties by the Farm Bureau calling
on Congress to abolish FSA.  Most generally widespread rumor was that
"Roosevelt pushed us into this war in order that he may become a dictator."
This rumor seems to have the greatest volume.  Another rumor,
"as soon as this war is over we will have to fight Russia."  was heard
from several sources in Marion County.  Latest propaganda is that labor
and Roosevelt have entered into a conspiracy to create a socialistic
state after the war.  This line is being spread by forces affiliated
with Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers,
principally the Associated Industries of Alabama.  Another threat concerns
work that is being done among the Negro population.  Story attributed
to a Pittsburgh Negro paper is that the Negro wants democracy
but does not have it, and he is seeking a trade with the Administration,
"give us democracy, equality of opportunity, and non-segregation and
we'll fight for you.  Deny us this and the war is yours -- not ours."

ARIZONA

Enemy is listening posters as well as educational
programs discouraging idle talk, are having quite
an influence toward killing rumors.  Among very few rumors heard recently
is one that Japanese planes have flown over Phoenix.  There is
also a rumor that propaganda is being spread among colored people that
Japanese like and honor Negroes, allow intermarriage, allow Negroes to
stay at their hotels and grant other privileges which are denied by
white people.  There is also a report circulated that Japanese to be
stationed at Parker were to be paid $50 per month for farming.  Several
bitterly antagonistic comments to any such plan have been brought to
attention of the State Director.

ARKANSAS

Most prevalent rumor has been concerning
Japanese atrocities.  Another was that stores were
receiving a percentage of sales of defense bonds and stamps.  There are
few rumors concerning the Allies.  It is reported that imported workmen
at the munitions plant at Jacksonville have been spreading stories that
cause unrest among Negroes working on the project.  These stories follow
line that Negroes have nothing to lose, and therefore, have no interest
in the war.

CALIFORNIA

Much discussion exists of rumor that American naval
vessels have been forced to use World War 1 ammunition.
There is some criticism of number of alleged Communists closely connected
with White House and other important Government positions.  Claim is made
