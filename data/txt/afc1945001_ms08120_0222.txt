went out on my lunch hour.
I went my the store
where my girl friend works
and told her what I heard,
She was so excited till she
made me go in a dress
shop and help her pick out
some dresses.  She bought
five and then when we went
out she said "they won't
catch me in this rationing"
Then I went back to work
until time came for me to 
leave and as I passed down
the street I saw a line
about 12 feet long of people
(ladies) waiting in line
to get dresses from a dress
shoppe, and I remarked
oh what a little talk might
do.
