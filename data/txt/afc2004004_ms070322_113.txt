for ambitions or appointments 
missed. Surrendering myself.
Now I am fighting myself
out of bed in the morning, not
that I'm sleepy or tired, but
that I have nothing really pleasant
ahead of me.
The ambitions are not mine.
The work is not mine. It belongs
to other people. I have to do it
because ---? Anyway I have
to drive myself to do a number
of things I find difficult and
which do no occupy me, which
do not give me the idea of myself
that I admire. So I don't
want to get out of bed. And I
itch, burn, violently.
When I was with Robin I
could say 1) I didn't care 2)
could blame it on her not caring
