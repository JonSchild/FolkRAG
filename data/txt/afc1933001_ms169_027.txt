Dear Alan:
As you will remember, at the time of
my pleasant visit with you and Seeger in Washington,
D.C. last summer, I spoke to you about
Dr. Leo Hayek, for twenty-five years in charge
of the Phonogrammarchiv in Vienna, but now a
refugee in the United States. He has just sent
me notice of a change in address from Columbus,
Ohio to 90 Western Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
I am sending this on to you with the
request that you also give it to Seeger, simply
in case you might wish at some time to get in
touch with him. His extensive experience in all
aspects of sound recording and equipment, as
well as that as Director of the Phonogrammarchiv
might well at some time make him very useful to
you. At least, I should like to keep the information
I gave you up to date.
It was most pleasant to see you last
summer, and I am, of course, as always, much
interested in the work that you, your father and
others are doing. I can't be sure of my plans
for next summer, but I am sure that if I happen
to get to Washington I shall try to see you at
least long enough for friendly greetings.
Very truly yours,
Miles L. Hanley
