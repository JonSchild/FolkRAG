CAJUN CULTURE VO   -14

LOMAX  . . .II, were looking for their roots
and feeling more confident of their Cajun language because
they'd heard, they'd met people all over the world speaking
French like they did. . .they. . .needed a new music and a new
generation of musicians provided it.  Many of them took
their model from [Amadee Ardois], the tragic dark figure of
the early period.  Among these was [Ire Legune], a
disadvantaged kid, nearly blind, but a genius as a singer.
It minds, reminds you of Elvis Presley.  He has a great love
of black style.  And he incorporated, he, he swallowed
[Amadee] whole and sang him through a white throat and
played him through white fingers.  And transformed the
black-white music of [Ardois] into a white-black white music
that suited its time.  It had the blues all through it.  It
had soul.  It had a lonesome feeling.  It was sensuous and 
hot and lonesome and blue.  And his records became the
mainstay of the Cajun jukebox up and down the line.  And the
young people of today look back on him the way that the
people in the hills look back to [Wyakoff] or Hank Williams.
     How's that?
     :  Nice.  What happens now?
LOMAX  Well. . .
     :  I, I don't. . .[MIKE OFF]
LOMAX  I played a bit of a hand in this
whole thing and I'm very proud of it because I was on the
Newport board in the days when the Newport Folk Festival was
big and they asked me what kind of music we should have next
