                                                                  July 8, 1940

Dear Alan,

                   Of course I was as astounded and angry as you were about that smarty
Thompson's paragraph about you and the "wire".  If he was accurate throughout
the book,I imagine there is many another person just as indignant as we.  Of course
he ought to have his hand called by somebody,but whether we are the ones to do [m] -it
I don't know.  I'm afraid it would just stir up a lot of fuss at a time when the stir
might not be pfofitable to anybody concerned. Maybe if you threaten a suit you might
get a settlement from the publishers.
                 I myself wrote a letter to Thompson asking for the source of the information 
I can't find a copy that I thought I kept,but I said,as I recall it:
               "I am the young man's mother.  I hold no such sentiments and I sent no
      such wire.  I should like very much to know on what information you founded
      your story".
No answer.  I should have written the publishers,I suppose. 
I wrote also to Mrs.Roosevelt, asking for her version of the incident.  She replied as follows:
                                              "  The White House
                                                    Washington

             "My dear Mrs.Lomax:

                                  Mr.Thompson is an Englishman, married to an American woman,
and whatever he wrote in his book he got fourth or fifth hand.  A woman
describing herself as the young man's aunt did wire that he was a 
Communist but the man who asked him to sing said he knew that was not
true and would be wholly responsible.  I did and said nothing.

                                                Very sincerely yours,

                                                                         Eleanor Roosevelt."

Which I think was  very nice of her- as much as I could expect from such a busy
woman,especially in such days as these.  If you do decide to sue,please do not
use this letter. I should not like to take advantage of Mrs.Roosevelt.
As for the aunt, the only person I can figure out is Aunt Molly Jackson ; for wasn't 
it about that time of year that she wrote you that ugly letter?  She was certainly 
in a malicious mood then,though I would not want to accuse her without investigation.  
You could find out about the supposed aunt from "Chief Constable Canning", probably ; 
I imagine they keep a file of such things,particularly  at the time of the King and Queen's visit.

         Your father cme back from a week with Johnny as fresh as a daisy. 
He had a great time at Camp Waldemar too in the capacity of advisor-in-chief to the
cowboy shindig.  This morning a card came from Mrs.Harold saying that she is enjoying
her visit with you and Elizabeth in the country.  We have had very little hot weather 
in Dallas so far.  Bess and Shirley write interesting letters.  Bess had a good time 
bossing the children and the maid while Shirley and Chris were away for a week.  She se 
seems to be learning some German and is inclined to stay on in Lubbock another term.  
We are willing for her to do what she thinks best for her German-welfare as well as 
her personal happiness.

[Im Im]                    I must stop this and do some work. Much love to you and the household,

                                                                                              Deanie
