Article on the War Effort
The Afro American -
It was revealed by this paper that
an interview with the popular Madame
Chang Chi Chaik was given very indifferently.
On a request, that the wife of the popular
Chinese hero, speak to a group of Negroes,
she gave a reply to the effect that she
was too busy and hadn't the time. The next
day, however, she attended teas and parties
given in her honor.
The interpretation made of this incident
was that the Madame had time for
social teas and parties but no time for
a word to the Negro populus who had
been sending aid to China relief through their
various clubs and organizations. Many have
viewed this as a race problem in which even
the poorer races in dire need do not look
upon the Negro as a significant being.
This situation, in all probability, will
play a significant factor in prevailing and
changing attitudes. It is of importance now,
because of the bill in Congress for more aid to China.
