10.
Now six pretty babes that are born by him,
The seventh lay at my bosom;
I would freely part with six of them
To spare the life of me Georgie.

Now the judge he looked over his left shoulder,
He seemed so very hard hearted.
He said, "Fair lady, you are too late,
Your Georgie is condemned already."

Now me Georgie shall be hanged in the chains of gold,
Such gold as they don't hang many,
Because he come of the royal blood
And courted a very rich lady.

Now me Georgie shall be hanged in the chains of gold,
Such gold as you don't see any;
And on the tombstone these words shall be wrote,
"Here lies the heart of a lady."

That's as far as I know it.
Lomax: That's a beauty.
Cox: Mm. I got mixed up in it there. That weren't correct there.
Lomax: The whole  thing is there. (pause) Cut off a minute, Peter.
(cut)
Cox: You gonna take that home?
Lomax: Oh, I'd like to learn it myself. Go ahead.
