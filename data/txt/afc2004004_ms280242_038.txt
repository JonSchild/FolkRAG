So I there and smoked, and a young girl comes round and
says, "have you wakened, Jock?"
I says, "yes." So she says, "I'll have  cup of tea for you in a
few minutes.  How did you enjoy yourself last night?"
"Och, I've a sore head."
She says, "We'll have to give a wee drap to you now.  Be sick." So
away she went and come back with a big half tumbler of whiskey and
a big bottle of Guiness.  So I got that, and then she gave me
bacon and eggs.  She says, "Did any of the boys pay you at all last
night?"
I says, "I don't know."
"Well, I'd better give you something myself."  So she went over and
put two pounds in my hand.
So I says, "God, it's ridiculous.  I don't want all that."
"Just take it now," she says, "You've got a family to keep.  We
didn't take you up here to play for nothing.  It's a good but to
come, you know."
So, God -- I happened to put on my jacket and get a wash, and
I put my hand in one of the pockets to look for a cigarette and I
felt some paper in my pocket.  Another 3 [pounds].  Says I to mesel'?  What's
this?" ahd [and] I pulled it out and told the girl they must have put
it in my pocket.  So the husband comes in - he was away to the
buyers with cattle - and, "How did you get on last night, Jock?"
I says, "O, by God, I'm sick."
"Did you get the money?" he says.
"I got money in my pocket," says I.  "Three pounds."
"I put it in your pocket last night," he says.  "But you were too
drunk.  I was going to take it out again but you fell asleep there
and we just covered you up with your coat.  Didn't like to
disturb ye."
So they took me back in the car home to the wife, and she was
awful pleased.  But she didn't like the idea of me being away all
night, because I had a wagon, you see.  She stayed by herself with
the kids.  So I never went away from home much more of a night, like.
But it was very dangerous leaving a woman with children in a caravan
by herself.
Lomax: And do you remember any incidents that happened when you
were playing at fairs?
Davy:  I happened to be playing at the fair of Puck, in Kerry, about
16 or 17 miles from Killarney, and I went to this fair and there
was a whole week of this fair - hundreds and thousands of people
gathered from all over the world, and it's a big green square
ground at the top of the town up a big hill -- a small country town --
and nothing there but wagons and Irish gipsies and tinkers and
donkeys and little carts.  Course, I pulled my wagon in there, too.
The old horse I had wasna in very good condition - what you call
in Ireland 'gammy-mouth" - that means he hadn't much teeth in his
