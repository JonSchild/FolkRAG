(write [?], Dublin

be helpful & easy -
the  only really ragged people I've
seen in Europe - also children who
didn't look well cared for - indications
of real slums all around - sagging doorways

it never is really worse anywhere in
Ireland except in bed with a hot water bottle
or when you're very drunk - lots of
colds and influenza.

St. Stephens green, a sort of fairy 
wood of lush green lawn - [?]
covered with holly - a blue [mountain?] range
[?] of fog there - children [?]
quiet

The biggest industry in Ireland is
making and distributing Guinness. The
special machine fo capping bottles.  The
 signs everywhere "Guinness is good for you"
and people really believe it, too.   Everywhere
you see the trucks & red barrels.  Everywhere
no matter how poor the district you have
the pub lined with bottles.
