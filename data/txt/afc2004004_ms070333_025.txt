Mr. Alan Lomax
c/o Mr. Newsome
Federal Writers Project
Detroit, Mich.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
As you know by now, a new machine was already sent you
by the time your letter arrived. Your arguments (and many others)
in favor of a 16" turntable had already been thoroughly gone into
but the unanimous opinion was that the smaller machine was more
suitable for the immediate needs of the Archive. The new Presto
has a two-speed motor. We made every effort to get you a machine
as soon as possible. In fact, if your first report had been
adequate, you would have had the machine by now.

I am very much concerned over your vagueness as to your
whereabouts. When the enclosed letter was returned today, I
thought it best to call Mr. Alsberg. He kindly promised to wire
the Detroit headquarters to hold the machine for you. Your last
letter gives absolutely no indication of your present address.

I have not been able to read your report carefully as yet
but it looks quite interesting. I cannot tell yet how much of
it can be printed but even if it has to be cut, I am glad to have
the complete report for our files.

Sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke
