in the street, it was just like buying a calf or coo, and they

Laddie, have you got a .. have you got a job?"  And you'd say "No."
"Are you staying at the place that you was at afore?"  You'd say
"No."  And you'd see em ... there was aye feller who'd say, "I'm
not feed, nor I'm not caring a damn," he'd say, like that to the
farmer, you see, and the farmer would, would engage him.

Well, "he'd say, "Fet can ye do to fairm?  Can you hoe Turnips?
Can you full muck wi a man."  And the laddie would say, "No,
I can full muck with a grip.  You never see anybody
he says, "Fullin muck wi a man," he says, - You see
the farmer tryin to take him doon there would say, "Can you
fill muck with a man?"  That's alongside of a man that he meant
but he says, "Can you full muck with a man," the man would say
"No, I fould it with a grip."  That means a grip, thrown it in over with, you
see, but he says "Can you full muck with a man,"  He was meaning
to say can you full muck alongside of a man,"  but it was the way 
the farmer put it saying "Can you full muck with a man."  That

he'd say "No, I fulled it wi a grip."  "And what wages woyld you
be wanting?"  "Oh, round 7 pound."  "Oh," he says, 
That's too much, I canna gie you that, but" he says "I'll gie ye five
pound."  Me says "If you get that, your getting enough," he says,
"Ye'll gae well when you're getting that," he says, "You've plenty"
he says, "When you're getting five pound.  I can't afford to
give you six or seven pound
