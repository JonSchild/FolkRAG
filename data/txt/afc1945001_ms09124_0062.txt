Rumors
    One day in the month of April I heard of 
a rumor about Japan.  It was told by a women
 who didn't know what she was talking about.  
Say that Japan would probably win the war.  She
 also so said that it was stated that little men
 shall rule the earth.  Then to top it she said that 
Japan hadn't turned out its big warships.  A man 
from the crowd told her to be quiet and everything
 was again calm.
