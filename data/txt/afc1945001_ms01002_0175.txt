EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

MEMORANDUM

To: R. Keith Kane, Assistant  Director
From: Cornelius DuBois, Executive Assistant

Eugene Katz and I had a most unproductive session with
Chester Williams of the U.S. Office of Education and
 Jack Potter of COI.  The rumor clinic project is at a 
stalemate and will have to be considered dead or at 
least on ice for the following reasons:
    1.  The Office of Education has had budget trouble
        and has no funds to go ahead.
    2.  Williams does not want to make a proposal to us. 
          He wants OFF (or whatever agency is given the 
          proper authority under the new set-up) to tell 
          him what is wanted, if anything.  And if we do 
          want to use colleges for our rumor gathering and 
          rumor combatting, he wants us to help him get a 
          budget.

In general, the Civilian Morale Service of the U. S. 
Office of Education expects to be stymied by budget, and 
in general, Williams is anxious to be of use if he can 
be.
