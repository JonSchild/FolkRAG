BJ TAPE 20, p. 52

You got to know how to treat a person.  You treat 'em -- 'Cause, some peoples, if
you [treat 'em] ah, ah, ah, if you treat 'em real kind an' good,
they, they think you ain't got good sense.   You got to kinda be
rough with 'em.   That's the way they like it.   They say, "Oh, he
crazy about me; he don't want me to speak to nobody."   That's a 
foolish person, to my idea.   But. . .
TL:       [she minds, huh?]  Ha, to mine, too.
BJ:       Yeah, b-but, but some folks like that.   "Oh, he's cl--"
They shet the door an'. . ."You, oh, you know, I cain't do that
'cause m-my husban', he, he don't want me to talk with nobody.
He. . ."   They like that.   See?   They. . .Some people like that, I
mean.   Everybody don't like that; but some people like that.   An'
they think that's it.  You say An' some peoples say, "Well, he don't
care nothin' about nothin'.  (FROM HERE TO THE END OF REEL THE DIALOGUE
IS OVER AN UNERASED TAPE)   I'd do it.   I was, I was talkin' to
So-an'-so; I was readin' with sech-an'-such; I was eatin' with
sech-an'-such, ah, an' then he didn't say a word about it.   He
don't care nothin' about me."   See?  Well, ya got to feed 'em
then rough(?).    An' that's the kinda treatment that they like,
see?   So. . . .!  So, that's the way, that's the way love is.   You just. . .You can't
consider the, the just because. . .because, you can't consider
just because one person ah, ah all, love kinda this stuff
everybody.                        everybody                     'Cause some folks
                     cussin' an' raisin' sand.  (END OF TAPE)
