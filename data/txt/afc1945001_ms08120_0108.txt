Ignorance

A Japanese-American was at a police station
explaining how he had got beaten up. He said,
Yesterday I was walking down the street and
a man walked up to me, he asked, Are you a
Chinese? I answered, No I am a Japanese
gentleman.

The next thing I remember was that I was
laying on the sidewalk.  [*Folder 120*]
