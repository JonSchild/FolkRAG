2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 6

IF YOU STARTED FOR THE KINGDOM

If you started for the Kingdom,  (3)
Don't turn back, no,
Don't turn back.

If you ain't got food nor rainments,  (3)
Don't turn back, no,
Don't turn back.

Keep your whole heart and mind on Jesus, etc.

Lord, I started for the Kingdom, etc.
Won't turn back.

If my whole family go back on me, etc.

If you ain't got a friend at all, Lord, etc.
Don't turn back.

Keep your whole heart and mind on Jesus, etc.
