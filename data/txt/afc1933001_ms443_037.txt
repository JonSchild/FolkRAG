[*"Sun-down man" - he can keep
walking and not slow down, until
dark.
** An extra good worker.
*** The captain in charge of
the most extensive prison farm
in Texas, the Central State Farm
at Sugarland. The Negro convicts
all respect and like him and
try to get placed  [on his farm] with him.
They regard him as a fine, strong,
fair and generous man as lenient
as [it] is possible under the con-
ditions. We must add that to us
he has been always kind and
courteous and helpful.
