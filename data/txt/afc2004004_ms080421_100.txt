Roll 44 Stan and Ray Hicks

Ray:  Well, this one's about Jack, where he wound up in the last of
it tieing death up in a sack.  And the way he got started, to get
that in the sack, was back at that time he was called to the war,
the army.  And he was hit(?) 30 years(?) in it.  And he come back
out.  They discharged him, and all you got back in, for your pay
as a discharge and (unintelligible) or get a big thing, and draw
a bonus of the years you spent in there -- you just got a suit of
clothes and two rolls of light(?) bread and it wasn't sliced.
It was a big roll. . . .a big load about like that, and he was a 
comin' home, after they discharged him, with his suit of clothes.
And he got in this little town.  And he run up, like beggars is
in towns, and we got 'em today.  And this beggar run up and said
"Mister!  Would you give me somethin' to eat?"  And Jack was
clever!  And he shoved out one of them loaves of bread, if he spent
would mean 15 years.  And so he went on out to the edge of town,
gettin' to the edge, and he run up on another beggar!  And he got
on to him for some of it, and he took his knife, and cut that one
open in half, and give that beggar half.  Then he stepped on down
a little piece, a distance, and he got to studying with him, in
that.  Now Jack (unint.) kinda wanted to be right in that way now
. . .in his feelings, consciousness.  And he run back and overtook
the beggar and said, "Here is the other half.  I won't sleep good
I can't feel good if I go on.  I met a beggar forgot before did
you, I give him one of the whole loaves, and here's the other half.
Well the beggar took it and said "Thank you.  Now that you done the
honest, I'm gonna give you somethin'.  Here's a sack.  You take it
and all you'll have to do if you get in trouble, you just say,
'whickutewack, in to my sack!'  It'll go down in there and
