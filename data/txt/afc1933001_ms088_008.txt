Goat Hill, November 14, 1941.

My dear John:

I am nursing the 'flu - not quite well enough to be out
except afternoons when the sun is shining - and busy as all scat!
I turn from finishing a reply to a brief and get to writing you
and Frank Dobie on another piece of the same long paper. It is
the fact I am writing, and not the paper, that ought to count.

Of course, I am not going to accept your invitation to attend
the Folk-Lore Society meeting with my expenses paid when I
have an earlier invitation from Frank Dobie to attend the same
round-up with all expenses for myself and my wife too paid. I
am a practical sentimentalist, you see. But like the old maid
who got the DDD invitation, and couldn't dance and wouldn't drink -
"I'll be at the party."

You may take your choice of topics for me to discuss:
"Folks" or "Feudin'." The general discourse will be the same.
I shall observe, of course, or at least submit to, the time
limit mentioned in your letter. But aside from that no "holts"
are barred.

You asked me about your boy. He is different in many ways,
delightfully so, and you have many reasons to feel proud of him.
It is only the folks who are different that are interesting. He
was a charming guest: no trouble to entertain, on the one hand,
and always springing the unexpected in the way of spritely contribution
to the board. He and young John O'Reilly, son of my
old adventurous friend Tex O'Reilly, stand out as the prize guests
of Goat Hil. And they are both fine boys.

About the fiddlings of my friend Al Brite, I am sure he
will render for you if we can make him understand that he is not
harming his ultimate intent to record them in some way to his own
financial advantage. You can advise him on that better than I can.
And I think I can convince him that your advice is well grounded.
I have to go to Austin Monday on a hearing there before the State
Board of Medical Examiners. I do not think that will require more
than the day, certainly not more than two; and after that I am at
your command. After that, I will have no more court until about
December 9th.

I am indebted to you for bringing my acquaintance your
Friend Goodwin from A. & I. I trust he will be in attendance at
the next meeting of the society. I am growing old, John. Have
to watch myself all the time to keep from growing cranky. That is
the worst product of a too long life. And occasional contacts
with young men like your boy and Goodwin put into an old man's
system some element that helps him combat the inclination to
crankiness.

The radio just reported that the Neutrality Act revision bill
passed the House by what we might call a narrow margin. The opponents
of the measure were, I think, right in contending it was a
virtual act of war, or, at any rate, a step which leads to that.
I have two boys and two nephews within the "fighting" age. If their
country needs them, they are ready to go with my blessings. One
of them has been with the Canadian Royal Air Force for six months.
He returned home this week from Ontario and will join the U.S. Army
December First. My grandmother said, in 1898: "I would rather see
my son's bones bleach on the hills of Cuba than have it said he refused
to answer the call of his country when his country needed him."
The sentiment still prevails in the family. I know of no case in all
Lindberg, except the cases of Lucifer and Benedict Arnold. The paper
is out, all out.

Yours.
