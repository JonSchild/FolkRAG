Committee on Communications and Public Opinion

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTERS

Purpose

            The committee on Communications and Public Opinion is interested 
in furnishing various government agencies with information about
the changes in public opinion in this area. One way in which one can
determine shifts in public opinion is to find out, over a period of time,
what people are talking about. Rumors in particular reflect the feelings
and attitudes of people towards the things in which they are interested.

General

            The Report Sheet, form #1, is to be used to report your findings 
to the Committee. This form should be sent in at the end of each
week so that it may be received in this office before Tuesday of the
following week. The heading of form #1 is self-explanatory. One caution: 
Be sure to space headed "Reporter's Code" is filled in before
mailing your report.

What to Report

            We are interested primarily in rumors about the war and about
civilian participation in the war. A rumor usually is concerned with
some item of public interest which has not been printed (except perhaps
in gossip columns) or reported over the radio. Rumors treat with what
people have heard, although often rumors are distortions of what people
have read. You can usually recognize a rumor when the rumor-spreader
begins "I heard... " or, "Someone who ought to know told me... , or "Everyone 
is saying... , or "Someone told me they read somewhere... , or "Have 
you heard... ," etc.

            Report all rumors about the progress of the war, Government
Policy, the Amy, our Allies, or any other information which you may
consider pertinent, such as reaction to sugar and tire rationing, etc.
Please be full in reporting these rumors. Tell us:

            (1)   What you have heard.
            (2)   Where you heard it ( such as "at the barber shop,"
                             or "at the bridge club, or "at a party, " or 
                             "on the bus."
            (3)   When you heard it (such as "yesterday," " two days ago,"
                             etc.)
