7.

Oh, when I git t' heaven,
Gwine to sit and tell,
Three archangels gwine t' ring dem bells,
Settin' down side o' de Holy Lamb.
                                                                    (Refrain)
Oh, when I git t' heaven
Gwine t' be at ease
Me and my God gwine to do as we please
Settin' down side o' de Holey Lamb.
                                                                    (Refrain)
When I git to heaven gwine to take my stan'
Gwine to wrassle wid my Lord like a nachul man,
Settin' down side o' de Holy Lamb.

I feel so good I'd like to shout, 
Religions turned me inside out
In my long white robe and golden shoes
I'll be ready when de great day comes.

I want t' go to heaven at my own expense
Oh, how I long to be there
If I can't get through the gate I'll jump the fence,
Oh, how I long to be there.

What kind of shoes does de angel wear?
Don't wear none cause dey walk on de air.

     In some of his songs, the Negro looks on heaven as a place 
for physical rest:

What I git to heaven I'll have nothing to do
But to walk around the streets and sing halleloo.

O Lord you know what you promised me,
You promised me a starry crown to wear.
When I get home.

Go, angel, and get that servant crown
An' place it on that servant head
An' servant you set down.

Set down, servant,
You set down.

O Lord you know what you promised me,
You promised me a golden waist band to wear, 
When I get home.
