Well, fortunately no harm was done; but it is hard to see what could have been
done to prevent the danger, or how it could be prevented in some similar case in the
future. Government agencies more than once considered possible methods of privately
informing newspaper and radio editors and military commentators, not indeed that
certain operations were contemplated, but that certain kinds of speculation would
not serve the public interest; but it was impossible to think of any means that
would not risk spreading too widely some suspicion of what was afoot; and every
additional person who knew--knew, as distinguished from guessing--would have meant
one more hazard of a leak which would certainly have been accidental, but could
have done great harm.

That is a case in which anybody can see that it made sense to withhold military
information. In other cases it is not so plain; and lately there has been some
loudly expressed dissatisfaction with issuance here of military and naval news.
Now it is not denied that mistakes have been made in the past in the issuance of
such news. The original announcements on the Tokyo raid were correct as far as they
went, but they omitted something; and that omission did mislead American opinion.
It misled the enemy too, which was its purpose; but that purpose could probably
have been accomplished, in the beginning, without misleading our own people. It
was not so done; and it was hard to see any way of correcting it afterward without
endangering the lives of many persons. Some of the news of ship losses in the
Pacific, also, while delayed only for reasons of military security, was unquestionably
delayed longer than was necessary. So there was much criticism; and it may
be coincidence that this criticism reached its peak in the week before the election.
But it is a fact, as Mr. Raymond Gram Swing broadcast recently, that the public
became more critical of the military news policy at a time when that policy was
better than it ever had been, and a great deal better than the public believed.

The basic principle of that policy, let me repeat, has been that the American
people is entitled to full information--except information which is not known to
the enemy; and which, if it were known to the enemy, would endanger American lives,
American ships, or the success of American military operations. This principle
of military security involves both operations which are going on, and operations
which are in prospect. Last summer, for instance, there was a good deal of public
clamor for action in the Aleutians. Now there's no doubt that our Army and Navy
are going to throw the Japs out of the Aleutians, in due course; and it would have
been a good thing to do it last summer if it could have been done without interfering
with more important projects. But those islands are a front of secondary
importance, from the strategic point of view; it was sufficient to put in there
forces strong enough to stop the enemy and put him on the defensive, in order
that we might concentrate stronger forces for the attack on the Solomons. But we
could not very well explain to the public that we were conducting not much more
than a holding operation in the Aleutians, because we needed the bulk of our
forces for an offensive elsewhere, which the enemy did not expect.

Military security is complicated further by the conditions of modern naval
warfare, in which air fighting plays so great a part. In some of the naval battles
in the Pacific, as you will remember, no surface warship on either side ever saw
an enemy ship; the fighting was conducted by planes at distances of hundreds of 
miles. Several other engagements have taken place at night, when visibility was
bad and neither side could be sure what damage it had inflicted. An instance was
the battle of Savo Island on the night of August 8th-9th, in which three American
cruisers and one Australian cruiser were sunk. Our first announcement of that
action was made by Admiral King on August 10th, and stated that our losses---the
Australians announce their own--were at least one cruiser sunk and two others
damaged, besides two destroyers and a transport damaged.
