LARRY:
I never did betray him in any kind of way and I'm so glad that friendship lasted you know and the last time I saw him sitting up in that chair and I said something and he was trying to laugh and he just couldn't get that laugh out of his mouth. And that just made me feel so good, you know. Well, Mrs. Davis, Brother Davis never did care too much about making records, I mean not until sometime in the 60's not back in the 30's.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well he had come to New York many years ago and made some records and that was the first time he came to New York. Some one brought him here and he made, I think his first record then and then after that he didn't make no more for a long time.
LARRY:
A long time, around the time I met you.
MRS. DAVIS:
Thats right.
LARRY:
I can't say that I blame him because it cost too much money to make records. I mean unless you get with somebody thats really--
MRS. DAVIS:
Well he don't have any trouble selling his records because he has so many fans and everybody and the minute new records come out they run out and get them you know. So really his records sells fast. Thats for sure.
