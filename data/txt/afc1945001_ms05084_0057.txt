OHIO REPORT
Due August 10, 1942

Aug 7, Con't.
The other day a lady of my acquaintance said to me, "There are too
many Jewish Doctors on the Draft Examining Boards. They hurry the Gentiles
through with little or no concern about their defects, but they go over
the Jewish recruits with a fine-tooth comb trying to find something to keep
them from going to war."  [*Cleveland, Ohio 8-7-42 18*]
