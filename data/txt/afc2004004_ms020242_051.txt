he'd a-been all messed up, see?  She'd a-had power over 'im.  As
it happened she didn't.  He made 'er walk back home.  An' made, an'
he made them spirits go hence back to her, ya s-- you know.  Go on
back ya know, to where they come from, the grave.  So Jenny --

But it was goin', heh, hit was goin' good!
AL:  He didn't turn anything back to her?

turned, just sent them back, to the grave, to rest.  When-whenever
