and rather serious it can be cured
if Doc will only come for his treatments.
Should you care to send him any thing
toward this bill please specify the
amount in your letter to him, so that
he will be willing to use it that way. Other
wise Doc will consider it all a Christmas
gift & feel no obligation to the doctor. But
should you say so much is your Xmas present
& so much for Dr Hunt, Doc will be
perfectly satisfied to use it that way. A
child's mind, again-

Yes indeed, we did receive the book
and I should have written much sooner
to thank you both, for it is very lovely.
We are enjoying it and will lend it
(with the others which she has) for Xmas
to Fannie Pickens so that they too may
enjoy it- Thank you very much for it.

By all means send any gifts you
wish to the singers & I will be so glad
to deliver them at Xmas time. They will
be most grateful.

With best wishes for  your father, and,
a Merry Xmas to you & yours
Affectionately
Ruby Pickens Tartt
