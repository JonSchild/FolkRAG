Mr. John Lomax
University of Texas Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Enclosed is a typed copy of your report, in which I have taken
the liberty of making a very few small changes. As you will see, I
have filled in the total number of records received from you this
year, leaving for the present the number of songs in each classification
blank. Mr. Waters had begun work on the title index to 
the collection a week or so ago. In the meantime, however, Mr. 
Seeger's assistant - Mrs. Robertson - has volunteered to assign one 
of her helpers to the job. I trust that this arrangement will work 
out - if it does not, Mr. Waters will continue.

A second copy of your report goes to Mr. Stevens, as requested.

Delighted, of course, with your reports from Blowing Rock,
Ashville and Arkansas. Thus far no word from Professor Morris.

On the 24th, we received a shipment of nine disks from Miss
Barnicle. These are the "Aunt Molly Jackson" records listed in the 
typed catalogue of the Barnicle Hurston recordings, but not previously
sent in.

Two packages and a letter from Macmillan have come for you here.
One package and the letter are marked "Hold." There is also a letter
from G. Schirmer. Shall we forward?

My greetings to Alan, please!
