Mr. Paul G. Brewster
320 Trussler Street,
Oakland City, Indiana.

Dear Mr. Brewster:

The old gentleman in Brown County is named Marion Stogill and he lives in Elkinsville. You had better hurry because he is very old and  feeble.

You can reach Mrs. Josephine Caney through the Federal Writers Project in Vincennes. I am terribly sorry I did not send you these addresses sooner, but I had more work recently than I could get around to.

It may be that next summer I will come through Indiana on the way to Wisconsin and Minnesota. In that case I look forward to seeing you and to doing further field work with you. I would like to suggest that you visit Mrs Dora Ward and her friends in Princeton. I felt that when I saw them that I had stumbled into a very valuable group of ballad singers.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
In Charge of Archive of 
American Folk Songs

P. S. Would it be possible for you to send me copies of all the material you obtain from the Parkses and the Bryants?
