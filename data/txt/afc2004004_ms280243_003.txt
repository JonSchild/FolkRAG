Lomax: You learned to read and write ?
Davy: Oh yes. When I come home from school at night, I saw
mother, sister, brother reading the paper and I'd have a go at
it. So I just mostly learned myself. I learnt myself going 
different places and seeing signposts and trying to make out
the signs and things.
Lomax: Were your father and mother happy together ? Did they
get on well ?
Davy: Oh yes, oh yes. Both couldn't read or write. Not one or the
other could read and write. Still, I don't know how they counted
their money, but you could never cheat them of a shilling.
Lomax: Did you have lots of fun at home ?
Davy: Oh yes, lots of fun. Music and fiddle playing and pipes
playing. In the summer time we'd camp and play a game what they
call kites. That was about 30 or 40 feet off. Two players would
stand one side, and we'd play the other side. You'd put up a
kite and have four each - stones - and we'd fling the stones at
the kite. Knock his down and there were three in the game.
And if you were a foot away, that was two. So we used to pass
the time away playing cards and going for tricks in the summertime
in the burns, and be away for nests and pigeon's eggs, climb
trees, everything.
Lomax: Did the boys run with the boys and the girls with the
girls mostly ? Or did you all run together ?
Davy: Mostly all together. Oh yes. Girls and boys played hide-
and-seek, errands at times, away to the farms for a drop of
milk, few potatoes.
Lomax: And the farmers were always friendly to the travellers ?
Davy: Oh yes. They knew us. They just called us the Stewarts.
If there was a wee boy or girl they'd take us into the
big kitchen and maybe give us a cup of tea and "sit down there
and give us a wee song." We'd sit down and give a song for the
children, and they used to give us some eggs home for mother,
or taters, milk.
Lomax: So you had to be a singer even when you were a child if
you were a Stewart. What was the first song you ever learnt ?
Davy: First song that I ever learnt was McPherson's Rant.
Lomax: Who did you learn it from ?
Davy: Well, I heard my father play the pipes and they told me
about McPherson getting hanged.
