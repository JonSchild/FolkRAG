addition to being fond of singing songs about their lives the cowboys also found pleasure in memorizing and reciting rough verses describing the adventurous side of the cattle business. Sometimes such songs were set to a simple tune. I was able to find authors for only about half of the examples presented in the Songs of the Cattle Trail.
The advertisement given me by Harvard University brought to me a large batch of miscellaneous material. Not until 1934 did I have time to go through it and put the best of it together. During that year the Macmillan Company published for me a book, American Ballads and Folk Songs,which includes what seems to me to be the best of the material produced in the United States.
