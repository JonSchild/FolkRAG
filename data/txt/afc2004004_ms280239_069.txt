10) When Johnny woken frae his sleep,
A sorry man was he,
Wi' his jaws and hands in iron bands,
And his feet in letters three.

11) Where will I get a bonny boy
Will earn both meat and fee,
And will run on to my uncle
At the fort o' Bennachie?

12) O here am I, a bonny boy
Will win both meat and fee,
And will run on to your uncle,
At the fort o' Bennachie.

13) It's when you find the Briggs broken,
You'll bend your bow and swim,
And where you find the grass growing,
You'll slack your sheet and run.

14) When ye come to Bennachie
Baith neither chap nor carl,
Sae weel ye'll ken old Johnny there,
Three fot abend them all.

15) You'll give to him this braid letter
Sae well my faith and troth,
And you'll bade him bring along with him
The bonnie Johnny More.

16) What news, what news my bonny boy?
Ye never was here before,
Nae news, nae news, but a broad letter
For your nephew Johnny More.

17) Benny he lies very low
On the top o' North stands high;
But for[a]the distance that lies between
They heard old Johnny More.

18) When on the plain the champions met
'Twas a grizzly ghost to see;
There was three feet atween their brows,
And their shoulders, bridges three.

19) This man then ran o'er hill and dales,
And over mountains high;
Till they arrived in fair England
At the dying of the day.
