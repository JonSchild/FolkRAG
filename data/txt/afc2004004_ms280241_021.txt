TAPE 84: JEANNIE ROBERTSON
Jean: I was almost away from my husband, right enough, but
not the way I thought. Just because I was almost dead and come
back to myself again.
Lomax: That was a very upsetting story, Jeannie.
Jean: It was quite true, and it will stay with me till the day
I die. It was so vivid that I couldna forget about it.
Lomax: Are there any of the ballads you know that remind you
of things you've seen in dreams? Or any sort of spiritual
experiences? There are ballads about spirits and ghosts. No?
There are several about ghostly lovers that come back from the 
grave.
Jean: Well, yes. As far as I've heard people saying, that up
and down the walks of Fyvie there's been little bits of strange
things seen, and they think it's Andrew Lammie and Tiftie's
Annie that gi'es the place a visit now and again. I've never
actually been at the graveyard. I couldna find it. . . .
Lomax: Where and when were you born?
Jean: I was born 17th of April in Aberdeen. My mother had a 
drunken husband and she was out looking for her livelihood, as
usual; and my mother took ill with me when she was on the road.
So she had to make home. There was a long lane - there were no
houses on it, but her house was at the top -- and my mother
did get home, finally did get home, but at the last lap, when she
come to the lane, this narrow lane, she said, "I couldna make
it any further. I had to get down upon my hands and knees." She
was catched when she was out.
Lomax: You were born in the street?
Jean: No - in the house. Very near it. But she took ill and she
made home. But she says at the last lap - a good job it was a
lane. If it had been a road it would have been a different
thing. But the lane - just two minutes walk to the house. "At
the last lap I couldna make it, but I did finally get in the 
house."
Lomax: So she didn't even have a midwife or anybody.
Jean: Oh yes. There were two girls there, friends, and they run
for the midwife.
Lomax: Were you a big child?
