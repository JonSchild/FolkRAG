seems the clash of lan...ces. It seems the clash of 
friends who guard their fu...ture. The friends who guard their

lances. My heart is sad but not with fear it
fu-ture. The her---oes come with lau---rels crown'd. They

torch-light--ed lan--ces glisten, their lan--ces glist--en
bards shall re--cord their story, Re--cord their sto--ry.
