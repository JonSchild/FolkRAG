Dear Rae:

How are you and how is the Archive faring? I would like to
obtain the highest possible fidelity copies of the recording of
Texas Gladden and her brother Hobart Smith. I recently made additional
recordings on Stereo. Both these great singers are now ill, 
and it would be thoughtless not to bring their recordings out on
records while they are still alive. I've arranged therefore, to do
this and would like to have copy tapes for dubbing.

I don't know how you bill these things, but I can pay in advance,
or when the tapes are sent - just as you wish. I don't know about the recording
numbers for Texas Gladden, but Hobart Smith's are 6723 - 6729.

All cordial regards,
Alan Lomax
