Dear Sir - 
I have listened to your old 
songs etc on several occasions 
& wondered if you knew the old 
ones sung around here 
"Leeds Auld Church" & 
Jim, the Carter's lad 
- I believe I have both these amongst my 
own old songs, they have both 
been sung here on many 
occasions & have good rousing 
choruses - Yours faithfully 
- (Mrs.) E. L. Taylor. (Proprietress)
