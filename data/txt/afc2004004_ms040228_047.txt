FLORA THE LILLY OF THE WEST
It's when I came to England some pleasure for to find,
Where I espied a damsel most pleasing to my mind,
Her rosy cheeks and rolling eyes like arrows pierced my breast,
And they called her lovely Flora- the Lilly of the West.

Her golden hair in ringlets hung, her dress was spangled o'er dressed
Rings on every finger, brought from a foreign shore,
'Twould entice both kings and princes, so costly she was
And she far excels fair Venus-she's the Lilly of the West.

I courted her awhile and in hopes my love to gain
But soon she turned her back on me which caus'd me all my pain,
She robb'd me of my liberty she robb'd me of my rest
I roam forsook by Flora, the Lilly of the West.

One day I was walking down in a shady grove,
I espied a lord of hig degree, conversing with my love,
She sung a song delightfully, while I was sore opprest,
Saying, bid adieu to Flora the Lilly of the West.

I walked up to  my rival with  dagger in my hand
And seized him from my own false love, and bid him boldly stand,
Then mad with desperation I swore I'd  pierce his breast
And I was betrayed by Flora the Lilly of the West.

I then did stand my trial and nobly made my plea
A flaw was in the indictment found, which quickly set me free,
That beauty bright I did adore the judge did her molest,
Saying, go you faithless Flora the Lilly of the West.

So it's now I've gain'd my liberty a roving I will go.
I'll rambe thro' old Ireland, I'll traverse Scotland through.
Although she swore my life away, she still disturbs my rest,
I must ramble for my Flora the Lilly of the West.
