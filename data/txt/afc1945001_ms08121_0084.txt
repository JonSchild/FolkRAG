A Rumor on Clothing

This was believed to 
have started by a woman
who sent in for a sugar
ration book. She sent in
for a ration book because
she had lost her other one.
And in its place instead o
of a sugar rationing book
she got a rationing book for
clothing. And on this book
it sead the price and how
many coats they would get
each year. In the corner of
the book it sead: Clothes 
Ration Book Two. So she
went and told all her
niehbors about the book
and how she got it. Then
when every body heard of
it, they all went and got
all the cloughs they could
get some men went and
bought 5 suits and some
more or less. It was so
crowded in the mens stores
