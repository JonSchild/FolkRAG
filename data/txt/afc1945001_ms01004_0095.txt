RUMOR DIRECTIVE

We wish to make a collection of War rumors current during the week 
beginning Aug 3 [July 27]. Will you please record all those that you overhear 
or are told you, using the enclosed form? 

For this purpose, a rumor may be considered a specific statement 
which is not readily subject to official verification; it is circulated
by word of mouth, and may or may not be true. 

In the present study we are interested in rumors which concern 
the war effort, directly or remotely, and especially in those likely to 
have an effect on citizen morale. 
                       
Please give each rumor verbatim and describe person telling each 
rumor, using a form like the following in reporting each rumor.
 
If you hear a rumor several times or in several versions, please 
fill in a form for each time it is heard.
