I went out in the little town called Watts, about 9, 10 miles form
Los Angeles - they had a lotta road houses those days (-) and
many others I can't think of.  A colored fellow had a place, by
the name of George Brown that wasn't doing any good.  And immediately
he accepted, but I told him I didn't want to open until he notified all
of Hollywood that I'd be working out there.
     Well, we had a lotta invitations printed and so forth and so on
and my opening night there was nothing but Hollywood out there.  That
ended the Cadillac.  They had to close.  They just kept on going down
and down and down - that they couldn't stay open any more because no money

produce a better band than me, which he had a very fine band and again
I found that Hageman was the stumbling block in myway again. He took
Hageman on the piano and that left me out without a job again.  By
that time the Cadillac was quite sure that I was the man, so Murray got
in touch with me and told me that if I would come back to the place,
he would give me half interest in the place.  So I went back and taken
the Black and Tan band, forming the organization of 4 pieces and
