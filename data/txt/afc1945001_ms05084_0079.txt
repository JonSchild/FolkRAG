Conversation between two drug store clerks:
"Do you believe that politics and pull are used at these
draft boards?" "Well, put yourself in the position of doing
voluntary work on one of these boards? Suppose some friend of
yours to whom you may be obligated or for some other reason,
asked a favor. Wouldn't you hate to turn him down if he asked
you to be as lenient as possible with his son? Wouldn't you do
it?" "Well, I suppose I would but I wouldn't want to work on a 
draft board. Even if you are honest and on the level, everybody
probably figures that you can be approached. They tell me that
some of these big corporations entertain these draft board officials
in grand style. They do it tactfully and quietly but when these
companies want somebody deferred, why the draft board official
remembers that they have been nice to him so he had better be
nice to them." (Heard about four times in a different form during
weeks.)    [*24*]   [*Denver, Colo. 8-6-42*]
