RUMOR STUDY (Directed By Herbert Blumer)
THE LISTENING POST
No. 3
Committee on Communications and Public Opinion

            Among the many rumors that are being sent in, certain groupings and 
types of stories have become apparent. With a few exceptions, the stories
which you are hearing seem to fall into quite distinct types. Some of these 
come from all areas that are reporting; others tend to be found only in part 
of the areas. Some are more popular around certain dates; others tend to come 
in more regularly. The Listening Post, this week, proposes to discuss several 
of the more popular groupings.

            Rationing, actual and threatened, has been a favorite rumor topic 
since the beginning of the reporting--out-numbering considerably any other 
single group of rumors. When sugar rationing was started, there were many 
stories, pro and con, concerning the necessity of the rationing. For example:

            From the Near West Side:

                        Somebody was telling me that sugar rationing was totally 
                  unnecessary. That we have too much sugar. But the government 
                  wanted the Middlewest to feel the pinch of the war and wanted 
                  to do it on a nation-wide basis so that the Middlewest would 
                  not suspect it was directed at the Middlewest alone.
            From Highland Park:
                        A woman whose father is a Minnesota farmer reported that 
                  she had heard that her father had received orders to blow up 
                  all of his sugar beets.
            From Hyde Park:
                        There is plenty of sugar on hand. Rationing is just to 
                  make us realize that we must help in the war effort.
            Again from Hyde Park:
                        There's plenty of sugar--the only reason the government 
                  registered everyone was to get a complete population registration. 
                  Did you notice that the spies were caught after 
                  the sugar registration--not before?
            From South Chicago:
                        A man in an A. and P. store made the remark that the 
                  government has so much sugar that it is being thrown into 
                  the ocean so as not to show up the government in its views 
                  about the rationing situation.

            With the threatened Middle-western gasoline rationing, many 
stories immediately started coming in on gasoline supplies. This talk 
also brought a new flood of general rationing stories. Explanations were 
offered, similar to sugar rationing: that people had heard that this was 
simply another way to arouse the Middlewest to a war consciousness and to 
feel the same pinch that the eastern seaboard was feeling. Or a story 
from the Near West Side stated that the "reason that we are having tire 
rationing is to save rubber for the war in case that the war lasts longer 
than it is expected."
