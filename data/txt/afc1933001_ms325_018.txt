On The Kilocycles
By JACK WELDON
Many letters have come to our
desk from school children of Roanoke
expressing their gratitude for
the "American School of the Air."
The origination of one of these programs
from the studios of WDBJ
has very probably played an important
part in making these students
express their appreciation
more vociferously. We have it on
good authority that this enthusiasm
has been at a high pitch for sometime,
but the children never had
reason to express their opinion until
one of the programs did originate
from Roanoke.
Not only have we had letters from
students but from some grownups
as well. We feel sure that if we print
some of these letters here that you
will enjoy reading them too. Here is
one from L. R. Campbell who is an
attorney at Independence, Va.:
"Gentlemen:
"I am writing to express my appreciation
of the program sponsored
by the American School of the Air
over which our local musicians were
able to play the folk songs and tales
of our community. The Bog Trotters
capably expressed the peculiar sentimental
music and a large crowd
gathered in the clerk's office to hear
them.
"Signed,
"L. R. Campbell."
And from Letcher C. Wingate,
treasurer of Grayson county came
this letter, which we deeply appreciate:
"Dear Sirs:
"All county officers and employes
of the same stopped work here last
Tuesday (Jan. 9) to hear the Bog
Trotters play the music which has
nearly been crowded out by modern
"swing stuff."
"A program of this type playing
the typical tunes of old times brings
back many, many memories and it
is a pity we cannot have more of
these genuine old time musicians
play for us.
"We all hope you will be able to
bring them back soon.
"Signed,
"Letcher C. Wingate."
The most interesting of the letters
comes from Dr. W. P. Davis, who
played the auto-harp with the "Bog
Trotters."
In his letter the doctor tells of
some of the amusing incidents that
occurred during the broadcast.
One is about the little girl who
heard Dr. Davis speak over the air.
She was so elated with having recognized
his voice she exclaimed,
"There's my doctor, there's my doctor,
and Uncle Alec."
Here are Dr. Davis' own words on
another of the unusual incidents:
"Some friends out in the county
were making a kettle of old fashioned
lye hominy, the first they had
made in eight or ten years. They
became so engrossed in the program
that they let the hominy burn, ruining
the entire kettle full."
The other interesting anecdote Dr.
Davis relates in his letter is about
Wade Ward's fox hound. You remember
that Wade played the Fox
Chase on his banjo and sang it too.
Well his favorite fox hound, Old
Lead, was dozing in the chimney
corner while Mrs. Wade Ward was
listening to the program. When
Wade started his solo, Old Lead became
tremendously excited and tried
to get out of the house, evidently
thinking that someone had started
up a fox.
To Dr. Davis we are indeed grateful
for these amusing sidelights on
the result of the broadcast. To the
many students who wrote us letters,
in appreciation, we extend a most
cordial thank you. We would also
like to express our appreciation to
the other folks who took time out
to write about the coast-to-coaster.
In expressing our thanks we speak
for WDBJ, CBS and the American
School of the Air and those responsible
for it.
