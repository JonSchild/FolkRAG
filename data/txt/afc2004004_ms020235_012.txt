go singin' an' come back singin'.
TL: Is that right?
BJ: That's what he'd do. You'd hear him hollerin' an' singin' 
'way over yonder. He could sing loud and good. An' you hear
'im jus' a-singin', whistlin' an' singin'. That just the way
he would go. He [never] have never slipped. Ha, ha, ha! He, he
would say, "You goin'..."
     I say, "Well, why you go...I hear you sing..."
     "I was cuttin' [grain] those greens when, when you heard me over there,"
he would say. Or, "I was, I was doin' so-an'-so." Ha, ha, ha,
ha! He say that why a lot a peoples git caught, ['s (because)] say they
in there slippin' around. An' he wouldn't do that kind of
thing. He just always go singin'. As loud as he can sing. Ha, 
ha, ha, ho, ho, ho, ho! [That was      got to be] Never seen nothin' to beat it in my life. Hu, hu,
hu! Brother, he'd have great turns a collard greens an' things. He'd
bring things to Mama. Carry someto somebody else, that he know
need it. He didn' care who it is. If he know they need it; he
didn't care who it is if he know they need it. An' he know they 
not gonna say nothin' about it, but he jus' go -- He ain't goin' 
where no lil' bit of it; he go where a lot of it at, so he
won't, won't hurt 'em. Say, "They got enought to ship tommora;
they can cut all they want. Can take out plen'y more." (THIS IN
THE CRACKER ACCENT) Ha, ha, ha, ha! He know to git it.
Yeah, he sure would do it. Umm, chickens, anything, if he wanted
it. He'd go an' git in there, would just go, jus' go hollerin'
an' singin'. Come back an' bring it to us.
     An' he'd git...git a hawg. I      way he kill a hawg.
But he'd kill a hawg an' bury 'im in the ground. You know, after
he cleaned 'im? The hawg keeps. Bes' kinda meat, um-hum. You
