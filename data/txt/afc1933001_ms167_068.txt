Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I should be happy to know what you think 
of the suggestion that the Library of Congress 
add to its collection some record of 
my manuscript "Echoes of the White House" as outlined 
in the letter to Mr. Archibald MacLeish.

Very truly yours,
Maury Madison
