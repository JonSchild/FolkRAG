some folks built stooped under, built up.  An' some is built in,
otherwise.  So tha's why it. . .That's the diffrunt in that.  That's

that the baby's sittin' in, ya see?  Tha's ah, some, some, there
is some of 'em that even can't birth a baby, you know, 'cause they
built in such a way.  They got to take 'em, all the time, ya see?
Too close built.  An' that, that person is built 'way back under,

TL:  Is that right?
BJ:  Um-hum. It's jis' like dyin'.  You know, Jesus said that a
woman would bear the second pain of death.  Ya see?  An' when
ya die, every, every, every one of your joints stands apart, see?
TL:  Oh, really?
BJ:  Every joint.  Jus', jus', it don't. . .Tha's why, that's why your

Because you stretches.  Every joint.  Every joint jus', jus' a
lil' bit; they jus' come apart, see?  Every joint, ya see?  An' ah,
then you are gone.
