Dear John Lomax:

Your letter of August 2, addressed to Mr.
MacLeish, has been referred to me for reply.
Mr. MacLeish is away on vacation and will not
return for several weeks.

I should like very much to have Alan
go to Texas new spring, but at the present
moment I doubt if we shall be able to finance
it. If you can possibly hold this question
open until you get here, it will make things
a lot easier. If any such funds were available,
I should have recommended your trip to the
middle west. All will be much clearer to you
after you arrive on the scene.

With best regards,

Sincerely yours,
Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
