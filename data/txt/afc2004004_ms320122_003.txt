A. LOMAX   Nobody, you could do what you 
wanted. Nobody knew you, who you were, eh?
MR. FOUGET  Oh no.
A. LOMAX  You could go and kiss the 
women that you weren't supposed to kiss?
MR. FOUGET  That's right, well you're

didn't know who you was. A lot of times I danced with a 
man. you know, and they thought I was a woman. I'd squeeze 
them a little bit. Well I've been going for years but 
lately over here [the body was] going out, completely out.
   But the neighborhood, they don't have no 
chickens, hardly nothing.  Now [Mamouse] taking over,

a lot of horses. Over here we don't have no more horses.
