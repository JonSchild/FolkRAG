5. One of our operators repeated
to me a story told her by
one of her patrons, aged 45. The patrons'
son was home on leave from
the navy and was surprised
to find his home noticing and
scarcity of meat and he repeated
how the navy that week had
thrown overboard 7 tons of meat
spoiled because not needed.
