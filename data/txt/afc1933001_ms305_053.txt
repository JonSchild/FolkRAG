Only One German Tune

There are songs of Scottish,
English and Irish origin. Strange
to tell, there is only one German
tune in the lot. There are
only three of Stephen Foster's
songs, and "Jeannie With the 
Light Brown Hair" is not one
of them. There is one Negro
spiritual.

A certain amount of editing
seems probable. "Mad'moiselle
of Armentiers" is missing,
though "You're in the Army
Now" has been retained. That
most popular of World War
songs, "Over There," has been
left out, possibly out of deference
to the feelings of the isolationists,
but "Where Do We Go 
From Here?" has been included.

A great many of the songs
chosen by the soldiers have
been composed by members of
ASCAP. None derives from the
catalogue of BMI. That's going
to be an embarrassment for
the radio chains unless they
obey the Department of Justice
and make peace with ASCAP.
As matters stand now they won't
broadcast Irving Berlin's "God
Bless America" even if sung by
the entire American Army simultaneously,
with chorus by
the Navy and the Marines.

Lomax Fails to Please

The Generals did not take
kindly to Alan Lomax and his
folk songs. They said the soldiers
will make up their own
songs. Especially will they invent
the words. Yet it seems
that the Generals were not too
well informed, at the moment,
as to just what the soldiers
already know of folk songs, for
several appear in the collection.

"Drink to Me Only With
Thine Eyes" (Old English),
"Minstrels Sing of an English
King" (Old American), "Home
on the Range" and "The Last
Roundup" (cattle country),
"Boll Weevil Song" (cotton
country), "Casey Jones" and
"I've Been Working on the Railroad"
(Northern labor songs),
"Juanita" and "The Man on the
Flying Trapeze" (pre-Civil War),
"God of Our Ftahers" (English),
"Auld Lang Syne" (Scottish),
and the three Foster
songs all fall into the folk-song
category.

Not For Civilians

From World War No. 1 come
"It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary,"
"K-K-K-Katy," and
"There's a Long, Long Trail."
"Dixie" and "Yankee Doodle"
belong with the folk songs, as
does "My Wild Irish Rose." Victor
Herbert gave the boys "Let
Me Call You Sweetheart." Dennis
King contributes "Slum and
Gravy," at least the tune, which
was borrowed without leave
from "The Vagabond King."
"Bombed" must be a new one.
It seems timely.

The War Department won't
issue the new song book to civilians.
There are copyright obstacles
to free circulation. So
many are ASCAP tunes.
