your pressings of these numbers for your collection.
I think they would amuse you

We are going to record a set of trios based 
on Liza Jane, Wayfarin stranger and Old 
John Hardy in the near future. If they 
come out successfully I'll send you copies.
They are for flute, harmonica and virginal.

I was going down in the brush to 
make recordings of a couple of Ozark 
fiddlers (I think I told your Dad about 
it) but the tire shortage makes me a 
little fearful of the roads down there. I
may take a chance in the Spring, however.

Many thanks for the reports and listings

If I show up in Washington I'll be in 
to see you. If you see Charlie Seeger
give him my best and tell him that 
Rita (my wife) and I much enjoyed the 
picture of his family .
Yours
Thomas H. Benton
