Conduct of War, Continued.
Employment official, 8-15-42: "I have heard several comments on the amount of
publicity about the English ruling family. There has been quite a lot of it in
[*2*] our papers locally, and the comment is that 'They're spreading it on a little
too thick.' " [*16*]
Employment official, 8-15-42: "In our contacts with employers it is not at all
unusual to have to sit and listen to the employer express his opinion that this
[*3*] administration is coddling the unions to the point that the war effort is
adversely affected." [*17*]
Banker, 8-14-42: "Politics are holding up the legislation that is most important
and the people are becoming impatient with it." [*18*]
Housewives with men in service, 8-14-42: "We are giving too much attention to
the election and politics, when we have more important issues at stake." [*19*]
Banker, 8-14-42: "There is a lot of criticism of the high wages and profits in
[*7a*] war production." [*20*]
Banker, 8-14-42: "There is a lot of criticism of the high wages and profits in
[*7a*] war production." [*21*]
Banker, 8-14-42: "There is too much red tape and too little coordination in
[*7b*] the defense program." [*22*]
VFW official, 8-14-42: "People are a lot more aware of the dangers of the situation
than they were, but they need a few more shots in the arm like we have had
the last week or so." [*23*]
Employee of Veterans' organization, 8-14-42: We will never get any place until we
have universal service. There is no excuse for letting capital and labor and the
farmer make exorbitant profits. They did it in the last war and they are doing
[*7a*] it all over again. All these cost plus contracts ought to be done away with.
Contractors are minting money." [*24*]
