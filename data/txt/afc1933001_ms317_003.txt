A "Humanizing Science" Book on
Botany for everyone to read

100 Illustrations

THE basic fact of our life is that the world is green, and
we can live upon it only because it is green. The substance
that makes the world green is known as chlorophyll
and it is rightly called the most important material in
the world. If through some inconceivable accident all
the chlorophyll of the earth should disappear today and no
more be formed, all the activity, all the work and worrying
of humanity, all art and science, buying and selling, loving 
and making war - all life would cease as soon as present
stores of food were exhausted.
     So, the entire living world depends for its sustenance on
the chemical process which occurs constantly in the myriads
of green leaves exposed by living plants to the sunshine.
For every revolution of a wheel or discharge of a bomb - 
green leaves absorbed sunlight somewhere, sometime.
The motive power that propels you over a highway was 
absorbed for you by green plants in a past so remote that
you and your words are lost in the mere telling of it.
     Mr. Rickett gives us an understanding of these things 
in a simple, easy-to-follow manner. He presents plants as
living beings and explains their complex activities as the
result of natural causes. next he shows how life in general
must involve chlorophyll. How animal life, our lives, are
secondary to that of plants. Then, speaking as a naturalist,
he tries to convey to us some of the beauty, interest and
pleasure to be found in nature. Mr. Rickett is an able artist, 
too, and he illustrates his points excellently with detailed
and unusually decorative drawings.
     Here is a book to read and re-read many times.
