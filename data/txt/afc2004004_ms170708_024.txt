Woman:  Oh, I thought it was lovely.
Kennedy:  Sing us a bit of it.
Cox:  (laughs)
Woman: If it doesn't exhaust him.
Kennedy:  It doesn't exhaust you, does it?
Woman:  You've got to do some work tomorrow, so you mustn't be exhausted tonight.
Cox:  I don't know.  This may be different to - go different to what you ...
Kennedy:  I bet it is.  I suppose it is different.
Woman:  Well, I don't mind.  But I'd like to hear it again.
Cox: I don't know, it may be a different tune.  The tune used to go like this here

It's of two jolly butchers, as I've heard many one say,
They were riding out of London all one one market day;
As they were riding along the road, as fast as they could ride,
"Oh, stop your horse,"  said Johnson, "I heard a woman cry."

"I will not stop," said Gibson, "I will not stop,"  said he...

I don't know if that's right, is it?

"I will not stop," said Gibson, "for murdered we shall be."
So Johnson bein' a valiant man, an' bore a valiant mind,
He tied his horse up to the gate, an' tried the woman to find.
