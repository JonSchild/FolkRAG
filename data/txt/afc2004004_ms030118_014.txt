(Pat: I haven't been scared of you all afternoon, have 
I?)
I don't reckon you is. Don't run from me
jes cause Miss Lizybeth's heah...You see, I have something 
very 'fectionary, makes them run to me.
(Pat: What is it?)
If you u knowed it, you'd be huntin it too. Like an old 
dog on a rabbit's track. (He bays like a hound several times)
(Me: what is that thing, Rev. Davis?)
What are you talkin bout? If I was to tell yo u, you'd be heppin 
huh hunt it. You an huh both woul d be huntin it. I ain't
gon tell you.
(Pat: what would you do about that woman at home?)
You know, Miss Lizbeth, some people brag that they
can git anybody they want. But that ain't the thang. The onliest
thing is, can they keep them. I can git anybody I want, an keep
em.
(Me: You can keep em too?)
Wh at you talking bout? An I don't have to drive no
stakes, an put no holes in the stob
to keep em either. I can keep anything I git. (He makes his voice
quaver with age) I'm a ole man, but I'm around heah!...The women I
git a-holt of, they beg me to keep em. You understand? (He
imitates the women's high, honied voice) Honey, please keep me.
Don't turn me loose. I want yo u to keep me.
(Me: I'm going to put a few things on the table. You
two go on talking)
we might git in too deep a waddah heah.
(Me: That's all right. Get in deep.
