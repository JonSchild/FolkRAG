Dear Mr. Brandon:

      The other afternoon I saw your excellent 
film and enjoyed it a great deal. It seems
to me that with the limited resources at
your disposal you did a very fine and 
sensitive piece of work. There is not a 
trace of artificiality or striving for
effect in the whole film. I shall be delighted
to write a foreword for your film.

     I'd like to do this gratis, but at
the moment I am somewhat up against it
for money, and I wish you would suggest a 
small fee, whatever you feel you can afford, 
for the work that I will put in in
preparing the foreword and bibliography,
etc.

     I have asked Mr. Nat Lawlor, who is
an important person in the MTMA and at 
this time very much concerned about folk
music, to view the film here. I feel 
sure the results of that will be good too.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
