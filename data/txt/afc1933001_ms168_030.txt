PO' OLE UNCLE NED.

Dar was an' old darky an' his name was Uncle Ned, an' he libed
libed libed long ago;
An' he had no hair on de top ob his head in de place whar' de hair ought
ter grow:
Hang up de fiddle an' de bow, bow, bow, lay down de shovel an'
de hoe,
Fo' dar's no mo' work fo' po' ole Uncle Ned, 'cause he's gone
whar de good darkies go.
His nails were long as de cane in de brake, an' his back 'neef
his troubles did bow;
An' he had no teef fer to eat de hoe cake, so he had to let
de hoe cake go.
Hang up de fiddle an' de bow, bow, bow, lay down de shovel and' de
hoe
Fo' dar's no mo work fo' po' ole Uncle Ned, cause he's gone
whare de good darkies go."
