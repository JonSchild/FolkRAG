Dear Sir:
In re: #4246869
We understand the travel advance account
has not been liquidated; consequently liability on our
bond which we executed for your as Surety August 25,
1937 continues. Kindly therefore let us have your check 
for $5.00 in payment of the renewal outstanding since
the 25th of August, 1939.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Yours very truly,
Helen B Bogan
Helen B. Bogan.
Cashier.
