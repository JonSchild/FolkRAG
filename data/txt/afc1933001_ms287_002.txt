The business of folk-song collecting is mainly one of
making friends with people, letting them know you appreci-
ate and like what they do. When they feel easy with you,
they can talk more eloquently than most novelists can write,
[and they will explain what their folk songs mean to them.]

[All our songs were transcribed from sound recordings
made across the country stretching from Maine to Texas.]
Sometimes we went to strange places to make our records
and we heard strange stories. One Negro convict said,

"I know when the big boss up in the White House hear this,
he sho' gonna do sumpin' to he'p this po' prisoner."

When we played the recordings back to our singers,
their response was often like this:

"Ain't men sharp? A man can't stutter none talking into
one of them things; got to stick to plain English. If he
don't, it'll tell on him." Aunt Harriett heard the sputter
of the batteries, saw the spinning turntable. She didn't
understand what was happening, but she pointed at the machine
and said, "Stop dat ghost!"
