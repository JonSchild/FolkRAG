F.-N.-M.

(1.) A young man & woman meet one day, very
happy to see each other, yet she was surprised in
seeing him for so many young men had gone to the Army.
She thought he was included, so she said say! What's 
keeping you out of the Army? He replied, I've joined the
Air Cadets. You see if a negro wants to stay out of the army
thats what he does.

(2.) A Magician once stated when asked could he cause
people to float or fly in the air. He replied, No, if I could
I'd certainly cause Hitler & Tojo to fly first.

(3.) A young man once exclaimed, I know my brother
is'nt going to the army because his ft. are absolutely
Flat.
