Mr. Roy Mitchell

Dear Mr. Mitchell:
     You and the Consort must both forgive me for
having neglected your letter for so long. This has
been a case of unwillful neglect on my part because
I am delighted at the prospect of working with you
     I shall today send a recommendation down to
Dr. Spivack suggesting that the duplicates you have
asked for be sent you when propper arrangements have
been made and that we work out some cooperative
recording project soon. Something should come of this
very soon, I think.
     I heard you on the Pursuit of Happiness
program last Sunday and was doubly delighted. First,
because the stuff was so good, and second, because
I had a hand in recommending you to CBS. I hereby
take my bow and pass it on to you.

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax
