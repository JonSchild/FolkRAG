you eat something or didn't you -- something like that. And may be they'll
hit it, you know, maybe [they] you did eat or drink something at such-and-
such a time like they said. Well, they got you then. They fix you up a little stuff and get a lot of money out of you. As long as people
can [pull] trot you out of money on a thing, brother, they'll use it. They [go] pour
[en] water and all like a that. Lose something, she tell em where to find it,
and they find it, [no] But I don't fool[ing] with it
A: You think she really can do this.
R: She've did it. There was a woman came by one day and had lost a dollar,
It was a silver dollar - , and she told her, says, "I lost a dollar 'tween
here and town." And she just [talking] thought a moment, she says, "Well, you lost that dollar
down in that little [cover] culvert down there." And she went back down there,
she looked and she didn't see it, and se went back and said she didn't
find it. And she said well, it's under something; you go back." And
she went back there and kinda looked under the [cover] culvert, and sure enoggh,
(laughter) the dollar waslaying [right] back under there.
And the woman lost a -- somebody stole her horse up there, and she
asked her about it. She told her, "Well, now, don't you worry about
the horse." She say, "That horse will come right by your house; [enough'll] twill
be s man driving it." And it wasn't but a week, I think, after that
before that horse [went over by her and] - men drove right by her house she stopped [in] him, got the [Lord] law &
[and th] got her horse, too.
And then, that glass company over there, they lost a typewriter and a 
adding-machine, and they came over there and asked her where it was.
And she told them it was out there in the country [in the] under a haystack. And
they went out there and they scraped around there, and they didn't find
it, and they come back. [They] She said, "[Now what about this] Well, it's out there", [Well] say. she
say 1/2 "Now you dig down there; it's down there." So they went back, and
sure enought they had dug a hole there, and set the thing in there and
had that hay over it. And they found it, found it down in there, and
