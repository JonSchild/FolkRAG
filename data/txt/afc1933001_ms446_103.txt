Old Ahab found it was not a joke. 
My, didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
He took no coat so he got soaked.
My, didn't it rain! 

4 

The time had come when Jesus must return back
home to heaven, 
He walked out to old Bethany with His beloved
eleven. 
He said, If I go back to heaven I'll send the HOly
Ghost. 
So tarry in an upper room, and don't desert your post. 
One hundred twenty minded God, bombarded heaven's 
door, 
When suddenly a mighty wind, and it began to pour. 

CHORUS 

My, didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
God opened wide salvation's spout, and floods of
glory came rolling out. 
My, didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
They all turned out to hear them shout, 
My, didn't it rain! 

No. 10  No Disappointment in Heaven 

There's no disappointment in Heaven,
No weariness, sorrow or pain; 
No hearts that are bleeding and broken; 
No song with a minor refrain. 
The clouds of our earthly horizon 
Will never appear in the sky,
For all will be sunshine and gladness,
With never a sob nor a sigh.
