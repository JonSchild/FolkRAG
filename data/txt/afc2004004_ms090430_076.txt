suffrage. One said:

This is the first year I voted. Last year the white folks
called themselves voting for us. Now they tells us just
how to vote. It don't matter to me 'cause I don't know a
thing about voting. But they tells us to vote and then
comes and gets us. We just go in with the papers the white
folks gives us.

I don't vote; I won't ever vote if I can vote for who I
want. Everybody votes the Democratic ticket around here,
but I want to vote the Republican ticket. Mr. ______ and 
Mr. _______ are supposed to be the leaders of the Negroes
in this section. They tell the Negros who to vote for 
and what not to do. In the end the Negroes get cheated
theirselves. You know that school was supposed to be a
brick one, but it was made out of wood. Mr. _____ get a
"rake off". The last time we had an election here everybody
was invited down to the school house and told how to
vote. And everybody did just as he told them to do. 

Some of the men voted "because it's legal", and some, hopefully, "so we can
get good government."

The School and the People
Since so many aspects of the life of the people are linked with
the production of cotton, it seems appropriate to view the school in this
economic framework. The school term, as indicated, is adjusted to meet the
demands for labor in the cotton crop. The extended use of the "split session"
in Shelby County, that is, a school session in the summer, enables
Negro children to have nine months of schooling. Whenever work must be done
on the farm, however, parents feel that they have the right to keep the child
out of school. The county truant officer is unable to cope with the problem
of poor attendance. Both the parents and the plantation owners protest if
he attempts to carry out his duties as indicated in the law and in school
