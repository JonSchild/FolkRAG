Dear Billy:
   Shortly after your letter came attaching the applications
I shifted over to OWI, and have since been pretty
busy curling up in my little corner of that huge aggregation
of thinkers. I'm having a wonderful time at it.
   The last couple of days however, I have been working
on the project I discussed with you in September, and I hope 
to have the whole business ready for you consideration in
two or three weeks, signed and sealed by the honorable Librarian.
   Let me put this bee in your bonnet   if you're wearing 
one this year. Do you think in view of the wartime emergency
and in view of the fact that these fellows would be 
absolutely invaluable to my work here in OWI, that the board
might consider launching the whole project sometime say during
February? IF that is a possibility would a letter from
anybody in OWI make it any surer?

Sincerely yours,
