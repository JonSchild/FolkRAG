       "RUMOR--New York is full of English soldiers and
       sailors. All you have to do is walk around Times
       Square; it looks like more than you find in England.
       Brooklyn is full of them too. Why are so many
       soldiers here when our boys are being shipped
       across?  And why aren't the sailors out with their
       ships instead of handing around New York?

        "ANSWER--By a British official in New York--'There
        have been no British soldiers here since a detachment
       of about 200 passed through about eight months
       ago from a South American base--Cameron Highlanders
       and the King's Own Shropshire Light Infantry.    The
       ones you see in Khaki belong to maritime regiments
       and are assigned to merchant ships as Army gunners,
       to replace Navy gunners. They can be identified by
       an emblem on their right arm, an anchor and a
       double 'A.'    They are in and out of town constantly.

       "'The cadets, training for the RAF in the South under
       the Empire's air training scheme, are all being moved
       back to Great Britain.

       "'The British sailors quartered here at any one time
       are never more than a few thousand at most.   They
       are: 1. Waiting for repairs on their warships;   2.
       recently arrived on troopships to take back new
       vessels; and, 3, shore-based naval attaches."

       On the negative side it should be noticed that the column
uses the label "Answer" for the rumor counteraction, rather than 
"Fact" or "Truth" or some other way of pairing the necessary belief with
the phony.   The phony should not have simply been labeled "Rumor" at the beginning, but with rumors of this length the term phony should be
inserted in the middle as well as being added at the end.

        The same source in a later issue tried answering the very tricky
rumor concerning Jews evading the draft. Normally, as suggested elsewhere, we might expect this rumor to be approached by pairing it 
with a series of other rumors about other groups evading the draft. 
This column, however, by emphasizing the local character of the specific rumors, was able to make an interesting approach. There are a 
number of defects in its specific handling but some sound principles emerge.
