4) For it's some do speak of my true love, 
Yet many more speaks of me, 
Bit I let them all say what they will, 
But I'll keep his company, 
I'll let them all say what they will, and I'll do the best I can, 
For I'm bound to leave this counteree and follow my nice young man.

Lomax: That's real true love, isn't it;

Bold Brenan on the Moor:
1) It's of a famous highwaymsn, a story I maun tell,
His name was Willy Brenan, in Ireland he did dwell, 
It was on the loft mountains where he commenced his wild career,
Where many's a noble gentleman before him shook with fear,
Brenan on the Moor, Brenan on the Moor,
Bold, daring, danting, stood Bold Brenan on the Moor. 

2) Brenan met a packman whose name was Pedlar Brown, 
They walked on togethertill the day began to dawn, 
Till he robbed him of hos money, also his watch and chain, 
But he once encountereed Brenan, where he robbed them back again!

3) When Brenan saw that the packman was as good a man as he, 
He took him on the King's highway, companions for to be, 
He made him throw away his pack without any more delay, 
And they proved comrades till their dying day.

4) Brenan's wife being down to town provisions for to buy, 
She saw her own dear Willy, and she began to cry. 
"Come hand to me that tenpenny, you really now forget,
But she handed him a blunderbuss from out below her cloak.

5) He held up the mayor of London, till he robbed him of his gold, 
Andwith their horse and saddle to the mountains they did fly.
For infantry and cavalry to catch him they did try,
He lay amongst the ferns that was fit upon the field,
Nine bulet wounds he did receive before he would yeild.

6) Here's to my deat wife, and likewise my bairinie's three, 
It's here's to my old father, who shed manY's a tear for me. 
It's here's to my old mother who tore her grey locks and cried, 
"O I wish young Willy Brenan in your cradle-bed had died."
