SID: (cont) er-those words that you sing?  How do you sing a thing like that?
NACHEZ:  Well, I-uh, like-uh a frien' of mines I know-uh were down workin' on the
railroad (long years ago --- I don' 'member when it was) but he used to 
sing some songs for me --- a little number called:
O ratty, ratty section
O ratty, ratty crew
Well, the captain's gettin' ratty, ratty, boys,
Y'know I'm gonna rat some, too.
SID:  Yeah.
NACHEZ:  You know, Sid, a song like that.
SID:  Yeah.
NACHEZ:  Well, he couldn' speak up to the captin an' the bos:. .
SID:  That's right.
NACHEZ:  . .he [the boss] wadn' doin' anything; he was layin' up sleepin'; but they still
had to work.  So it give him, give him the blues, an' he couldn' speak his
min', so he made a song he could sing 'em.
SID:  That's right.
NACHEZ:  Still, I say, it's signifyin'. .
SID:  That's right.
