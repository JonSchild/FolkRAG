Route 4
Burlington, North Carolina

Dear Mr. Collins:

The machine will be shipped to you today.  I thought for a 
time that I would be able to bring it down myself and give you instructions
in its use, but you will have to go by the following information. 
May I point out that it's very important for you to record
these songs as nearly perfect as possible so that they will be useful
as recordings.  To this end, keep experimenting until you get a really 
silent and satisfactory cut. before you begin each recording session. 

You were correct in telling Mr. Greer that recording for 
us would not prevent him from making other disposition of his collection.
I am sorry that it will be necessary to put any sort of restriction
on the collection and I wish you had mentioned this before.  However, 
we are willing to abide by your restrictions as you suggest. 

You can keep the machine until the middle of December with 
welcome.  If you happen to have time, you might look up a Negro
harmonica player in Durham, North Carolina who is undoubtedly the 
best harmonica player who has ever blown his harp in this or any other 
portion of the universe.  I have jogged Dr. Spivac about the price costs. 

cordially yours, 

Alan Lomax

with instruments, the place and the date. Put down below the first line,
