Dear Alan:
I have only just learned that Mr. Latham was unable 
to spend the latter part of this week in Washington as he 
planned owing to the dearth of hotel accommodations.  I had 
counted on his seeing you while he was there and talking 
with you about LISTEN TO OUR STORY.  That's why you have not 
heard from me sooner.  I am doubly sorry as I had thought 
that if he could have gone over some of the material with 
you it would have heightened his enthusiasm for the book
and would have given the whole project the necessary shot 
in the arm to put it over.  Unfortunately, despite my best 
efforts, I have not been able to persuade our editorial 
board to offer a contract for the book on the basis of 
the material which you have sent us.  As I am sure you 
realize, this whole business of translating the spoken 
 word into the written word is something new in publishing 
and as is natural sometimes successful and sometimes not. 
Somehow or other the material which you gave us, while 
particularly rich and colorful seems to lose something 
rather important when read rather than heard.  This may 
 be because we are not used to it and may well be 
that by the time the book was ready we should be eating 
this sort of thing up.  Just now, however, it seems a 
little strained, and with all the difficulties which the 
war has brought to the publishing field, we hesitate to 
make a definite commitment on the book.

I realize, of course, that you may hesitate to 
go ahead with the preparation of future material on the 
book without a definite assurance from us, but I can't 
help hoping that you will.  Perhaps one of us will be 
in Washington a little later in the spring and if so can 
see or hear more of the material.  I am still very bitterly 
disappointed that your hotel situation was so bad as
