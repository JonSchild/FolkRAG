Greensnake.
Asa Ward.
Greensnake was one of the fastest [lads] mans in the world. [There, I knowed] Been everywhere & knowed everything & do everything. 
[that to be a fact.] It was a little boy come [long] walking on the [raod, wanted] road one day, you
know, [hollering.] hungry and he didn't see nobody to ask[ing] for nothing to eat so he go [to] in [the] this man's
house and [strpped] set down to the table to go to eatin. Greensnake's wife
hears him [in there] and asks him, "Son, what are you doing here? "Well, I'm just
[gonna eat] only eatin'." She said, "My husband more than [500] 4500 miles away [from home], but he'll 
kill you if he catch you in here." [So the lad said] He said, Lady, well hide me somewhere,
please." She [hid] put him in the closet.
By the time she [hid] got him in the closet this man hit the house, says,
"Old lady, where [the] 'at boy [that] was here?" I got him in the closet."
"Bring him out and let me see him." She brought him out and [he] let him look[ed]
at him, and he liked him pretty well. [so he] He [set] take him [down] back to the table 
[to start] & let him finish eating [and] So after dinner he took him down to the new ground [to] and
learn him how to work,
The boy worked, I [should say,] think about 6 or 7 months. [, and] Greensnake
beg[a]in to like this kid and [learned] some of his pranks -- what he could do.
The boy got smart and turned to something and went home.
[Why, I believe] When he be way out in Texas there was a man coming [a]long one day says,
"Sam, bring your chicken down to town,[. T]tomorrow, we're gonna have a
chicken fight." "I ain't got no chicken." The boy said, "Poppa, [tell]
[him] you[‘ll] be down [there] in the morning[. You’re gain useless. You gonna sleep five] with your game rooster -- spurs on his feet five 
[acres] inches long, [quarter to] comb three." [Walked on I’m again, cut some of them] Boy gets up, walks to the end of the gallery, turns a somersault 
[down gain less, poured three time,] turns to a game rooster, crowed 3 times. , daddy picked [on up a door and sat down] him up carried him on down 
[Piled everything down there.] town. Whip out everything down there.
The next week or two there's gonna be a ho[g]ss race down there. This boy
