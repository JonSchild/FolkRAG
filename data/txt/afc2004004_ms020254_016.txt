BJ:  Oh. Oh, the very first time, I called Miss Daisy.  You know,
her sister.
TL:  Did you?
BJ:  Yeah.  I called her sister, ya know, jus' ta show her how it's
done.
TL:  What did you say to her?
BJ:  I ju' talk wit' her, ya know, an' tol' her I was talkin' on the
telephone!
TL:  Were you scared?
BJ:  No, no.  Wasn't scared.  Jus' sounded so funny.  Sounded
like she was right there!  I was like the old man was about it
from the country:  I had never talked on one an' didn't -- Ya
know, there used to be a lil' round box thing, it looked like a 
box thing.  You know, you win' it, too.
     An' so they say this old country man, come from the country?
They say it's a white boy.  He had never seed one in his life an'
he come, come to town.  He was sellin' some aigs an' he -- this
really true, ya know?  -- an' he went into the sto' ta sell
aigs.  An' the man tol' him he didn' know whe' his wife wanted
'em or not; he would get 'em, ya know?  If she wan'ed 'em.  He
said, "Wait," said "I'll ask my wife."  An' he ah, you know,
wound that thing an' he went to talkin'.
     An' he could hear 'er talkin', too, ya know, the boy did.
So the boy stood there an' looked.  An' he could hear 'er talkin'.
An' all. An' so. . .
     So she told him to git 3 dozen.  He says, "Yes," says, "She
wanted 'em," says, "She wants 3 dozen." Fresh aigs, from the
country, ya know? An' so.
