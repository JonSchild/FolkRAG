The flames from the fireplace and one coal oil lamp furnished
all the light, a light that flickered and trembled from the wind creeping
through the cracks between the logs, perhaps from the music that throbbed
through the cabin and seemed to sway the branches outside. It was a 
happy evening, and up in Washington Elmo Newcomer's music and calls
live for other generations. Other breakdowns of Elmo Newcomer's were:

Blue-eye Susy,
Rye Whiskey--"with capers". (.other wise known as "The
Eph Caught a Rabbit, [and] Drunken Hiccups.)
Wagner.

Admiral Byrd found "Home on the Range" cheering during his long,
cheerless vigil at the South Pole. I first printed the phrase "Git 
Along, Little Dogies," immortalized and unacknowledge in the deservedly
popular "Last Round-Up."

But best of all,--a librarian once told me that he had bought 
forty copies of Cowboy Songs: "The high school boys stick them under 
their jackets and forget to bring 'em back."
