My dear Mr. Lomax, 
Please forgive me for not having written to you sooner, but
I thought that I'd better do all of my research before sending
anything to you, and such is my poor hunting that I have only
one new song which to send you now. The one, I wish I were a Scholar
I only have in the smallest of fragments now, but I think that I can 
get more of it. This Gambler's song, if I haven't sent it to you 
before, is a good one, I think, and as complete as it can be.
It was one of my grandmother's favorites, and she used to 
moralize her children with it.
The Gambler's Song
This life is but a game of cards
Which everyone must learn. 
Each cuts and shuffles and deals the cards, 
And then his trump doth turn. (or 'he turns.')
Some may turn a high card
While others turn a low
And some may be quite flush with trumps
While others none can show.
When hearts are trumps we play for love
And pleasure rules the hour.
We laugh, we chat, sweet verses make
Through summer's rosey bower.
