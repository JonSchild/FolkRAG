Mr. Lomax:

Someone in the Personnel Department mistakenly
sent our office the wrong forms for you to fill out with
your application. The papers with the old and inappropriate
forms are "going through". In the meantime, however,
we need the other forms as soon as possible so as
to make the rectification.

Will you please fill out the enclosed form in
triplicate and return to us at the earliest moment?
