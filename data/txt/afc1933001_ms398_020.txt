Fiddlin' Joe's Song Corral

This department is offered in order to preserve the old cowboy songs
and frontier ballads that have come down to us by word of mouth from our
grandfathers. It is also intended to help you folks who enjoy collecting
Western songs.

If you want to find the words to some cowboy song, write and tell us
about it. We'll do our best to find it for you and publish it in the magazine.
If you know any of the old songs, send them to us for publication, giving as
much of their history as you can.

We do not send out copies of songs to individual readers. All we can
do is tell you in what issue of Wild West Weekly you will find find the one
you want.

Send all communications, with your name and address printed clearly,
to Fiddlin' Joe, care of Street & Smith's Wild West Weekly, 79 Seventh
Avenue, New York, N. Y.

Here he is again! None other 
than John A. Lomax hornin'
in ter the ol' Song Corral! I
reckon yuh all know by this time
that John A. is the greatest collector
of old Western songs and cowboy
ballads in the whole U. S. A.

I've told you gents and gals in the
Corral before how John used to go
around the old-time cow towns and
mining camps with his spring
recording phonograph, and how he'd
get anybody who had an interesting
ballad to sing it for him.

His work as a collector of cowboy
songs has been praised by the big
college perfessers up at Harvard and
other institootions of learnin', and 
he's recently finished a big book,
"American Ballads and Folk Song,"
