MRS. DAVIS:
But thats a true story, he told me that a number of times, thats true, just playing for a party and he said he had on a white linen suit, and he say when he come out of the chimney the suit was as black as that clock over there, and his guitar. How'd you do to keep from getting, how'd you get out of there, he say I got out, he was a lucky blind man. There no doubt about that. But he did go up the chimney because he told me.
LARRY:
I laughed, laughed about that thing. Even now, I just see him going up that chimney.
MRS. DAVIS:
Yeah with a white suit on him.
LARRY:
I guess he thought let them kill each other, as long as they don't kill him.
MRS. DAVIS:
I think thats the same time he got underneath the house and there was a big dog under there and the dog started growling and he say Now you just take it easy, we both going to stay under this house tonight. I heard him tell that a number of times. Well one thing about animals he liked to be, they loved Rev. Davis all he just do is touch them, they would never bother him, cause he said he touched this big dog cause he was growling cause he came under there where he was and he didn't bother him. He say everything was all right. Theres a lot of things that he told that
