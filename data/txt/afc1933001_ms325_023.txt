IT'S SPRINGTIME IN 
the Smokies

If you haven't already, you soon will be hearing these
fine Tennessee folk and their WSM "Grand Ole Opry"

By T. H. Trent

UNCLE JIMMY THOMPSON sat
in that dingy WSM studio and
scraped his bow over jumping,
throbbing violin strings until they
smoked. George Hay, head of the station,
sat with his foot a-tappin' while
"Tennessee Waggoner," "Give the Fiddler
a Dram," and "Late Last Night
My Willy Came Home" hummed in his 
ears.
   Presently he said, "Uncle Jimmy,
you've been playing more than an
hour. Guess we'd better call it a 
night."
   "An hour, fiddlesticks!" Uncle Jimmy 
retorted. "A man cain't git warmed
up in an hour. This program's gotta
be longer."
   So, in 1925, was born WSM's "Grand
Ole Opry" program
   WSM's "Grand Ole Opry" is unique.
It was expanded in 1926 to four solid
hours of music and songs and it has
been broadcast continuously ever since,
with two important exceptions. One:
President Roosevelt borrowed a half-
hour for a fireside chat. Two: A memorial
program to Will Rogers took
another half-hour.
   Wherever WSM can be heard - and
it can be heard over most of these
United States - listeners have hummed 
the music of the "Grand Ole Opry."
More than likely, other listeners will
hear it soon also, for it is scheduled

- a part of it anyhow - to go on one of 
the networks this spring.
   We wonder if any other program
in America can boast a record of fourteen
years of continuous service. That 
is 728 consecutive Saturdays. George
Hay, who started the program and 
who still conducts it as the "Solemn 
Old Judge," must look back with deep 
satisfaction at the memories it has
brought him.
   For example, how most of his musicians
came down right out of the hills
and off of farms in order to make
music for their neighbors. Uncle Dave
Macon was one. For years he had 
been the conductor of a double-shovel
plow. That had been his profession.
But his pastime had been banjoing. In 
the evening, on the porch of his house,
he would get out that five-string banjo
and entertain himself and whatever
neighbors happened over. Those neighbors
did not have to urge him long to 
"try out" for the "Grand Ole Opry."
   He did, and became an instant star,
turning professional at the age of fifty-
six. Today, Uncle Dave Macon is seventy
years old, never misses an Opry
performance, and is still the greatest

star of the entire seventy performers
that make up the cast. Known as "The 
Dixie Dewdrop," he is the acknowledged
king bee.
   His songs reveal both a deep religious
feeling and a sharp sense of humor.
It was his humor that stood him
in good stead last year when he went
to New York to make recordings.
   Walking down Broadway, with his
gates-ajar collar, his big plug hat, his 
shiny gold teeth, his billy-goatee, and
a watch about the size of an alarm-
clock, Uncle Dave was feeling so good
he just had to take that banjo under 
his arm and start a-strumming it.

A NEW YORKER thought he would
have bit of fun-
   "Where you from?" he asked Uncle
Dave.
   "Tennessee," came the rely, and
the old fellow did not miss a beat on
his banjo.
   "Strange people down there,"
taunted the New Yorker, to the titters
of a gathering crowed.
   "Yeah," came back Uncle Dave, "but
they don't come in bunches like they
do up here."

   Hollywood has something to look
forward to when Uncle Dave and his 
fellow performers trek westward late
in May for the filming of their first
motion picture. It will be titled "The
Grand Ole Opry," and co-star the
Weaver Brothers and Elvira.
   While Uncle Dave Macon, the "Dixie
Dewdrop," is the king bee of the Opry,
there are many others that played during
the first year of the show and are 
still going strong as the Opry approaches
its fifteenth anniversary next
November.
   The Fruit Jar Drinkers, the Possum
Hunters, the Gully Jumpers, DeFord 
Bailey, and the Crook Brothers join
Uncle Dave among the first-year original
performers. None of the old group 
has ever left, although several have 
since died, including Uncle Jimmy
Thompson.
   What will never die, however, are
the songs they sing--words and music 
that stretch back through the years to 
the earliest settlers of America, the
true folk-music of this nation.
   Among these favorite Opry tunes
which have been handed down from
generation to generation from earliest
times are "Tennessee Waggoner," "Nobody's
Darlin' But Mine," "How Many
Biscuits Can You Eat - Forty-nine and 
a Ham o' Meat, This morning," "Bully 
of the Town," "Rabbit in the Pea
