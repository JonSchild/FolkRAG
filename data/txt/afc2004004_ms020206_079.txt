Reverend Roe.  Reel 6.  P. 6
A: is there any name for [that that's] that as different from shouting?
R: They just happy, and that's the way they acts, you know,
A: [Of course] Course, some peole would call that dancing.
R: Well now, I haven't seen our people, say, dance in [the] our service, I've seen [it done] um dancing in the
Holiness Chruch -- [they just] have music and they just all dance.
A: You think there's anything wrong with that?
R: Well, I don't think there's anything so sinful about it, if the people
[*very hesistant*]
you know, is si ncere, and yet is seems [a sin on account] to set a kind of a bad
[preacher there] precedent. I think that they have as much right to dance in the
ballroom as they do in a church. I wouldn't advise it in my church.
However, if a person get happy, why let [them] him shout. But I haven't yet
seen everybody in a church shout[ing at] the same time; I've [never] haven't
seen that, but I8ve se n in the Holiness Chruch all [the] these people dancing
at onetime.
