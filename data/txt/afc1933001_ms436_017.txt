Dear Mr. Putnam:

Will you please send me a file of review clippings 
on my book so that I can have them photostated for my files.
I will return it intact with great promptness and if you are 
worried, you can send it by registered mail. 

[*Sent to author of Jazz Record [?] Nov. 6th*]
Ask your people to send a copy of the book to Charles 
Edward Smith, 35 Stuyvesant Street, New York Sity, and to 
Taissa Hillman, 51 Leroy Street, New York City.

[*SUPP. LIST MAR 3 1942*]
I have prepared a long outline on Listen to our Story 
which I will send to you in a couple of days.  I am working 
so hard on the preparation of broadcasts that I have not had 
time to write any sample commentary but hope that you will take 
the commentary in good faith in view of the introduction to 
Our Singing Country, the autobiographical section of the Lead 
Belly book and a couple of lengthy articles which I will attach.

I am going to have time during the Spring to work on the 
book and hope that you will make it possible for me to go 
ahead with it.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
