A few years later Bob Hanna, 
a singing cowboy, rode into my life. (C) [Early in 
the spring of each year Bob [rode] 
away to the west - to the San Angelo 
and Abilene country - to join 
a trail herd of long-horn cattle headed for Dodge 
City, Kansas, The town where the 
real west began. For years [it] it was the largest 
cattle market of the world. 
Texas with its free grass was, the breeding ground.  
From its broad prairies 10,000,000 longhorns were driven over land to market in [?] years 
following the Civil War.
Bob Hanna would come
back at the end of the  summer
with pockets full of money, riding 
a new saddle on a paint pony,
 dressed in cowboy style, boots 
reaching to the knee - flannel 
overshirt, buff trousers stuck 
in his [the] boot tops, crimson handkerchif
 knotted about the throat,
a wide-brimmed ten gallon
 tall hat (never creased in the center) pulled slightly to one side, 
and, as a final finishing
 touch bright silver broad 
shafted spurs with bells that 
jingled and tinkled with swaggering easy 
stride. Yes, he was a rowdy, a boastful 
braggadocious.  But he could rope and toss a 
steer in two seconds and he was my [hero?]
I can remember as if yesterday 
how Bob would ride up to the thrashing
[where with the men and boys crowded around him]
crew, singing as he came 
curl his right leg around 
the horn of his saddle and 
chant [sing] shady ballad about 
"The Keyhole in the Door" [where] 
a story of the sly adventures of a peeping Tom.
In a [bu??] peeping Tom next door
neighbor to the bedroom of a newly married
night to the bedroom of a newly married
