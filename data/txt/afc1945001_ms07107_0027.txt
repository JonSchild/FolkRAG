Rumor No. 2, "that this country faces possible trouble with the Negro 
race, that trouble is already brewing in many of the Southern states, 
and particularly in Washington, D.C. Incidents in the nature of riots 
have not been publicized in Washington, such as hotels using tear gas 
bombs and police aid to eject Negroes form premises; that it is not an 
uncommon sight in Washington to see Negroes escorting white women on the 
streets. This trouble is caused by Negroes demanding equal rights with 
the white people throughout the country, particularly in the South. This 
rumor was heard several times, once on August 3rd, and again on August 7th."
