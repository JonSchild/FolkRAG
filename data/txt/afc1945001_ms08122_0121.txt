The name given to this Cartoon Was 
"Making It Legal"

This cartoon shows Hitler and
Laval showing France (as a
woman) that they mean business.
That they want France to 
surrender and stick with them.
This cartoon also shows France
all battered up and thus she
hasn't very much more resistance.
Laval and Hitler have a gun
pointed to France and are trying 
to make her marry Hitler.
