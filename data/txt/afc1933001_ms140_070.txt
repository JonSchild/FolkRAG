Dear Mr. Arnstein:

Forgive me for not having replied to your letter
before, but my correspondence has been unusually heavy
recently.

The songs collected by the Archive of American Folksong
are still almost entirely on the original master recordings
and as yet we have no facilities for duplication of these
records. Perhaps within the year the records will be
generally available and of course whatever request you care
to make at that time will be given due consideration.

A great many of the songs you are interested in can be
found in published collections such as American Ballads and
Folksongs, by Lomax; The American Songbag, by Sandburg;
Negro Work-a-day songs, by Odum & Johnson; Songs and Ballads
of the Anthracite Miner, by Korson; Negro Songs of Protest,
by Gellert. If further information is desired, I would
suggest that you be much more specific because your request
covers the entire field of American folksong.

I suggest furhter that you communicate with the
Co-ordinating Committee for Folk-lore in the Works Progress
Administration, of which Botkin, of the Central Office of the
Federal Writer's Project, is chairman. I feel sure they can
give you material aid.

Sincerely yours,


Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
