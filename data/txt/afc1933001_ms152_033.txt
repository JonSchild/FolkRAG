Mrs. Glen H. Noyes
Tunbridge, Vermont

Dear Mrs. Noyes:

I should like to see copies of four ballads
that you mention: "One Stormy Night, Who's That
Knocking?, How Paddy Stole the Hope, The Apples are
Ripe."

A letter will go to Mrs. Hough this afternoon.
In the mean time thank you for your kind interest in
helping me.

Very sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
