SING ME A SONG WITH SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE, continued

sing me of bread-lines Tell me of front page news Sing me of strikes and

last min-ute head-lines dress your ob-ser-va-tion in syn-co-pa-tion!

Sing me a song with so-cial sig-nif-i-cance there's noth-ing else that will do-- It

must get hot with what is what or I won't love you.

2nd CHORUS

Sing me a song with social significance,
All other tunes are ta-boo.
I want a song that's satirical,
And putting the 'mere' into 'miracle'-
Sing me a song with social significance,
Or you can sing till you're blue --
It must be packed with social fact
Or I won't love you.

Sing me of kings and conf'rences martial
Tell me of mills and mines,
Sing me of courts that aren't impartial,
What's to be done with 'em?
Tell me in rhythm!

Sing me a song with social significance
There's nothing else that will do --
It must be tense with sommon sense
Or I won't love you!
