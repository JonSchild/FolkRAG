awarding of Government contracts.  Look at the treatment accorded Kaiser's construction plan."
New York 13 (Department store buyer):  "The small business houses are in desperate shape.  No war contracts are reaching them, even when they have converted for the purposes."
New York 8-12:  "Every day the WPB does something new to cripple small business.  This is a big business war and there won't be half a dozen small manufacturers left when it's over."
New York 8-12 (Engineer):  "What hope is there that we will wake up in time?  The Navy is still pouring millions of tons of metal into hopelessly useless battleships, when we need planes and more planes.  Why don't they listen to Kaiser?"
New York 8-14 (Reporter):  "It makes me sick the way they have neglected airplanes, relatively.  Why in God's name are we building twenty super battleships when with the same material we could build thousands of planes?"
New York 8-15 (Merchant sailor):  "Yes I love a good ship, but I got sense enough to see we don't need battleships made by Bethlehem Steel Company instead of planes.  When I ship out of this port each time I hope the Navy will give us plane protection, or mosquito boats.  The cruisers and destroyers don't do half as good a job."
New York 8-14 (College student):  "It is clear to me that the big ship builders such as Bethlehem Steel have made some sort of payments to key officials in Washington to make sure that we shall go on building needless battleships.  Even the stupidest freshman can see that battleships are absolutely no use today.  This man Kaiser seems to have the right idea."
New York 8-13 (Steamship agent):  "Admiral Land and his friends are doing all right for Bethlehem, and the Navy is the same way."
New York 8-14:  "We are still building twenty useless battleships."
