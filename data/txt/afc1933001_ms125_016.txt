1 P.M.

Dear Harold,

I'm sorry I missed you in the afternoon. This evening I drove round & round the part of town where your house was but I couldn't find it.

I've appreciated all you've done in helping me to get this trip and I'll write you as soon as I've news.

I established new contacts in Harlan today who will help me solve to [the?] Barnicle-Fuson conflict.

Au revoir.

Alan
