Visit Mrs. McNeil - Bara
5 feet tall, round head & face, 
teeth gone, fine blue eyes, squarish 
red hands, sits singing in a strong 
voice below Sacred Heart picture --
 on wall opposite -- faded photo 
of the little old sweetheart sitting next 
her young sailor husband with 
his bold black eyes, his fine black 
moustache open color & big shoulders.  
She has a broad gold band & 
a great laugh & a strong voice at 
eighty.  Her house is two rooms &
a hall in a glen next the only 
clump of trees I've seen in the 
islands.
O ho he hewa ho
Ho ho wu yella...
It's about a boat that went out
for seed oats to Raasay & they 
ran into dirty weather
