I'M LABOR

Words by S.H.Friedman
Music by Harry Mayer

(From the Rebel Song Book, p.26)

I dig your ditch-es, I'm la-bor; I man your snatch-es, I'm la-bor, I

teach your kids and make your shoes, I sow your pants and write your news, With brain and brawn, with

nerve and thews, I'm la-bor. (He's la-bor.) I'm com-mon folk, I'm la-bor: I'm

al-ways broke, I'm la-bor, I run your mails in rain and snow, I clear the track, so that

trains can go, But some-one else gets all thoedough, I'm la-bor. (He's la-bor.)

II. I have no say, I'm labor;
I just obay, I'm labor,
I slaved through years of hate and war,
And spilled my own and my brothers' gore,
But did I know what the shootin' was for?
I'm labor. (He's labor.)
I'm starved and kicked, I'm labor;
I'm always licked, I'm labor,
When I ply my noodle, trowel or pick,
I'm a decent sheeny, wop or mick,
But when I strike I'm a bolshevik,
I'm labor. (He's labor.)

III. I don't get tired, I'm labor;
Or else I'm fired, I'm labor,
From birth to death my life is spent,
In hovel, shack, or tenement,
But still some landlord gets the rent.
I'm labor. (He's labor.)

I'm very humble, I'm labor;
I never grumble, I'm labor,
In summer heat or winter gale
I pack a load or swing a flail,
But some one else rakes in the [K?le]
I'm labor. (He's labor.)

IV. I fight your fires, I'm labor
I cleanse your mires, I'm labor,
Your towers that top the mountain crest,
Your teeming east, your bounteous west,
I wrought them, I, the dispossessed,
I'm labor. (He's labor.)
I drill your sewers, I'm labor;
I plow your moors, I'm labor,
On earth in mine, on sea, in sky;
