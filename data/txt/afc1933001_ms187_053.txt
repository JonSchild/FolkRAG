Dear Alan:

I have your letter and must
request that you drop my name from your
Rosenwald project. I am quite sure that I 
don't make sufficient notes in the field for
your purposes, and I am not able to foresee
any satisfactory solution to my transcription
problems, by way of preparation toward moving
the discs with ready dispatch into your archive.
I am very sory that I have, more or less inadvertently 
of course, permitted your to trouble
yourself in my behalf.

Regards.
L. W. Chappell.
