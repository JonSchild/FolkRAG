400 East 34 St.
Austin, 4/28/1935.
Dear Frank:
Please hand this receipt
to Mr. Strunk.  Also did you 
get a letter from Alan asking
you to send him some texts of 
songs and also to send some two
records to Professor George
Herzog?  Alan also wrote to 
Mr. Strunk about the same 
matter. Kindly let me hear
what has happened.  Our book is 
involved.  Love to the baby.
Your friend,
John A. Lomax
