Fourth Version *                                 4. 

Jesse James was a boy that downed many a man, 
 He held up the Danville train, 
He robbed from the rich and he gave to the poor, 
 He'd a hand and a heart and a brain. 

Chorus : 

     Poor Jesse left a wife to mourn all her life, 
       His children three were brave, 
     But the dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard, 
       He laid poor Jesse in his grave. 

 Jesse's brother Frank cleaned out Gallatin Bank
   And he took all the cash from the place, 
 And they shot Captain Sheets in the public streets, 
  For it was a lively race. 

 Jess went to the depot the agent for to see, 
  And there they surrendered the keys 
To Jesse James and Frank who had cleaned out the bank, 
   And the agent was on his knees. 

 And that same midnight when the moon was shining bright, 
  They stopped the Glenville train, 
They were bold hearts there and they did it without fear,  
  It was planned by Jesse's brain. 

Then the sad, sad thing what we have to sing,  
  When Jesse with his family in his shack 
Was reading the Book when Robert Ford took 
A shot at poor Jesse James.
