Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have no particular claim on those
recordings. However, I cannot answer your question
until I know whether there is any financial side to
the transferance of the Rebecca Jones songs to the
N.C. Folklore Archive. I can assure you that I am
entirely willing that the songs be "made available".

If there is any financial dealing, in
any way, in regard to any use whatever of these
[*3425*] Ebenezer records, please let me know at once. If there
is no financial involvement, go ahead and make any use
of them which you see fit. - You will, of course,
only transfer the songs and recordings of importance,
There was some experimentation and several short recordings
"for fun" on part of the records.

Hope we can meet someday to discuss several
points in folk lore & folk music work in America.

Yours sincerely,
Richard Chase
