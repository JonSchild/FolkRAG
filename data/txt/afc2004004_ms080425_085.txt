Time Code:  Tape: #226 Sacred Harp p. 2
AL: Well, in a sense, this is a real Musical Shrine, isn't it,
because it's you Sacred Harp people that actually keep the 
church up and the church has very few members; so it's
a kind of shrine to this music that you local Sacred Harpers have
made.
Man: That's right, we painted the church, we take up donations.
We built the picnic table and put a top on it. We keep
up the grounds, keep up the cemetary, mow the grass.
We buy the electricity, buy the gas that goes in the 
heaters. Everything that's is done at this church is
done by the community of the Sacred Harp singers.

Mr. [P]: We're gonna start on page 12 and review what we went over
the first two or three nights.  Remember that I said that 
Sacred Harp music is divided into three parts: dynamics,
melodics, and rhythmatics. Rhythmatics is your time and 
accent; melodics is your tonality; dynamics is your power,
high and low. Now on page 12, this is a musical staff:
5 lines and 4 spaces, and these is what the music is 
written on.  The shapes is fa, sol, la, and mi.
The fa sol la is doubled: fa sol la, fa sol la; the mi
is a leading note between major and minor and it's only
used one time.  A degree staff is from 1 to 8; 1 to 2
is a degree, 2 and 3 and so on up the scale til you get up to 8.
A brace is where you got four of your staffs tied together,
Treble, alto (2nd from the top), tenor (3rd from the top), 
and Bass is on the bottom:  that's your brace.  We'll go
over the G clef, letter staff:  hold up your hands, and this
is your musical staff.
