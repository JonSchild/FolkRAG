SHINE OH! LIGHT
(Tune: Volga Boat Song - Sheet Music, Century Music Co.)

Shine Oh! Light,
Bryn Mawr Light,
Lanterns ever held on high.

Lo! From mountains and from windy plains
Crowded cities and country lanes,
Here are we gathered
From near and far,
Sure of thy welcome,
Hail Bryn Mawr!

Hark, through the rustling trees the soft winds blow!
See in the western sky the sunset glow!
Go forth with singing
Seeking the way,
Bright lanterns swinging
On - till day.

Now our eager feet to you return,
You for whom our steady lanterns burn,
May that sure wisdom,
Though we are far,
Guide us and strengthen,
Hail, Bryn Mawr!
