Fisk. 16. 2
I don't know, sir, I know a lot of  songs --
Take me a good while to count um up --
something like a 100 -- knows more that
100 though - I can play any kind of church
song a man want to hear -- and reels.

The Carrier R.R.
     The whole 21 verses in it.  Sid Hemphill
Carrier song, played & made by him.  Just
about 1903 about Mr. Carrier's Train -- Dave
Coward & Mr Bailey -- They's engineers.  One of
um was a rough engineer & the other was a good un.
Down here by Ballantine.  To haul logs on.
The train wrecked at Malone's trussle & didn't
kill nobody but it scald two or 3.  I made
the song -- sent after the doctor & everything --
got all that in it.  Mr. Williams - I don't
know whether he livin or not - he put the
tresstle back up - he  ax me to make a song
about it.  Every one hear it except  Mr.
