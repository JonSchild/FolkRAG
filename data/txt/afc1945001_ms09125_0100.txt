Yesterday, a girl came in the store
where I work and asked for some canned
goods.  She bought a can of soup and a
can of [tomato] peaches. The soup was six
points and the peaches were twenty one
points.  I told her that would be twenty 
seven points from her Book. She very reluctantly
gave me her ration book.
Then when I told her it would be thirty
eight cents she became very indignant
and said it was only twenty seven. I
had to go through it again and show her
that prices and points were different. She
was still very angry and when she
left she was going to write a letter to
Washington and tell them that it was
wrong to charge different prices & points.

Another lady came in once and said
that a man had been sent to jail because
he killed his horse to feed to
his dog.
