Miss Marie Prince
9711 Parkgate Ave. 
Cleveland, Ohio

Dear Marie:

I'm awfully sorry that we have missed each other on your
trips east.  I'm afraid if you come on Christmas week we will
be away again, because I am going off to some learned conventions.
The Cleveland affair was a frost, because I decided 
not to go at the last minute. 

Since you left Washington, the Archive has grown very 
rapidly, and we are much busier than ever here.  I hope you can 
come in and see me some time.  Elizabeth and I often speak of 
you, and it's nice to hear that you are well and getting along.

Mucho gusto,

Alan Lomax
