end and reason but only to die for poor sinners. It was
the great design of Christ to save poor sinners, sirs, and if 
you will not credit me, look into the Scripture and then surely

Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Mark, sirs,
He came into the world to save sinners. Christ hanged upon
 the cross to save sinners. It was for poor sinners all the
hardships, all the wounds, all the trials and sufferings which
he met with. It was for the sakes of poor sinners Christ
hath suffered all this woe and merely for thee and wilt not thou
leave thy swearing and thy drunkenness and thy wickedness for
Christ? Oh, the sad day that is coming upon thee! Oh, who
will pity you when you are damned, when you are howling and
roaring in hell that would not pity yourselves?
