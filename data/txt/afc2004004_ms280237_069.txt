Harry Cox. Lomax flat, London, December 1, 1953.

Lomax: What's the name of the song, Harry?
Cox: Long Peg and Awl. But it ain't fit to sing anywhere about
outside.

As I was a- walkin' one morning in May
I met a pretty fair maid, her gown it was gay.
I stepped up to her an' back she did fall;
She wanted to play with the long peg an' awl.

I said, "Pretty fair maid, will you travel with me
Unto foreign countries strange things for to see,
And I will protect you what e'er any befall,
And follow your love with his long peg an' awl.

Then home to her parents she then went straightway
And unto her mother these words she did say,
"I'll follow my true love what e'er may befall,
I'll follow my love with his long peg an' awl."

"Oh daughter, oh daughter, how can you say so?
For young men are false, you very well know;
They'll tell you fine things an' the devil an' all,
An' leave you big-bellied with their long peg an' awl."

"Oh mother, oh mother, now do not say so;
Before you were sixteen you very well know
There was father an' mother an' baby an' all,
You followed my dad for his long peg an' awl."

Lomax: That's a beauty, that is a beauty. . . Would your father sing
that at home?
Cox: He usen't to. He used to sing it at the pub sometime.
Lomax: What?
Cox: At the pub, when he got among a rough crowd.
Lomax: But he wouldn't ever sing that in the house, would he?
Cox: No. Not mention him anywhere - not at home.
Lomax: Harry, let's try that one about the clippers; they girl she
said she was like a clipper ship.
Cox:
Lomax: Tell me about the song - what's the idea of the song?
Cox: Well, I can't tell you much about the song. I sort of get it off
these old shipping people, sailors an' that. . .just a sort of sea
song. Well, you know, kind of blokes what roamed about these towns
up there. (pause)
Lomax: How did you run onto it? (pause)
Cox: I might try it.
