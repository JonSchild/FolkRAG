Vera Hall, Reel 2 of songs . . .

Vera, what does that mean---
          RR Bill was a mighty big fool,
          Couldn tell his track from a horse or mule?
V: Well, Rich Amerson said it mean that he just soon to lope on
his feet as to ride and he'll catch mule , cow, horse, ox, train
just anything be passin. Can't make no track that RR Bill went
thisaway, cause he liable to catch anything and he just sung
that about him. (Quotes verse) That means that he'll likely just to catch
anything to ride, just likely to run, do anything just to get
awy from wherehe is from place to place. . .
Well, was he kinda of a magic man with tricks and things like that?
Did Rich Tell?
V: Well, he didn't say, but he said he was a bad man. He would do
anything, anything that was mean and bad, RR Bill would do it and
and if he went anywhere in the world and you had to go that way--
that's why that he sung about
          RR gone around that curve,
          If you go around there you better raise your
                                                            nerves. . . 
because he gon start sumpin no sonner'n he see you. He was just that
kinda man.
