Dear Dr. Spivacke or 
emissary --
When I wired you first 
I was ready to leave this region
& go on toward Ironwood, 
but I planned to take
it slowly and work my 
numerous contacts between 
here and there -- it is 120 
miles. there.  I thought, of
course, you would be able to 
send me my salary by wire
