SPEAKING of the boys who
trail herded from Texas up
the Chisholm Trail, Mr. Lomax 
once wrote, "They
brought new songs back with
them for the entertainment of
their friends." So the coonskin-
capped flatboatmen who floated
south to New Orleans with boats
full of produce brought back the
new songs to their homes in the
Ohio Valley. Folks stayed up all
night to learn those songs: the
returned wanderers got a hearty
welcome. So does a new volume
edited by Mr. Lomax and his son. 
Here not only the cowboys and rivermen
bring us their songs but also
soldiers and sailors, lumberjacks
and canalers, muleskinners and
bullwhackers, miners and farmers,
convicts and hoboes--in short,
all working, singing America.

Here are some of the great
lovers of American balladry, flatnosed
Cotton-eyed Joe and
Stavin' Chain, king of the midnight
creepers. For some reason
or other the Lomaxes have not
yet given us versions of either
the Hawg-eyed Man or Limber 
Jim, though they have collected
the levees where used to be sung
the exploits of these "nachul-born
easman." Possibly they will 
appear in later collections. Side
by side with these warty native
boys are such foreign-born refugees
as the optimistic Tom
Bolyn, alias Brian O'Linn and 
Willy Reilly, who was saved so
opportunely by his own Colleen
Bawn. Here's Diamond Joe, rich
enough to wear diamonds for vest
buttons, and John Henry, the
West Virginia Negro steel-ddrivin'
fool whose epic Mr. Lomax calls
"probably America's greatest single
piece of folk lore."

Reading and singing through 
this collection, one notes many
wandering stanzas, those popular
catch-lines of balladry. Years ago
I heard a Negro rouster on an
Ohio River packet sing, "I'm 
gwine to have a dollar some ol' 
day," and here I find that line
has drifted into that favorite
song of the migratory workers,
"Chilly Winds." The rouster who
sang the song had saved up $130 
and at the end of the trip was 
quitting the river to open up a 
coal and candy store in Cincinnati. 
Dinah, the maid who stood
with "Shoes and stockin's in her
hand and her feet all over the 
floor," wanders winsomely from
one banjo tune to another, here
from "Old Joe Clark" to "Lynchburg
Town." "She took me to her
parlor, she cooled me with a fan"
--that catch-line has emigrated
from the Irish "Roving Journeyman"
to its American derivative
"The Roving Gambler" and hence
moved on to "The Wandering
Railroadman" and "The Wandering
Steamboatman." Here a Negro
convict has sung it into a
work song. One sees the principle
of natural selection working
through these wandering stanzas.
It's no wonder that such a catchy
quatrain as this tends to rove 
and ramble:

Old Massa had a big brick house,
'Twas sixteen stories high.
And every story in that house 
Was full o' chicken pie.

The Lomaxes have raided song
books as well as hollers and bottom
lands, honky-tonks and
boogie-houses to give us this new
vocal cross section of America.
They offer composite versions of
many songs, often bringing together
stanzas from widely separated 
sources. Most of these
songs have been collected in the 
South: "The Southerners sing
'em: the Yankees come down here
and collect 'em," I heard an unreconstructed
Rebel say last
Summer, who, incidentally, sang
a fine version of "The Dodgers."
He was forgetting the Lomaxes, 
who both sing 'em and collect 
'em. Those Lomaxes have made 
their most interesting finds
among the Negro jailhouses of
Texas, Louisiana and Alabama.
Here, cut off from the outside
world, the Negro sings to Ol' 
Hannah, the sun, praying her not
to rise again till Judgment Day. 
Pompcalf may sing that the sun's
no more than a ball of foxfire, 
but these Negro convicts 
chopping cotton in the blazing  
heat of the Brazos bottoms know
better. Here Monday is Blue
Monday; Saturday, Christmas 
Eve; Sunday, Christmas; and between 
long days of labor and 4-o'clock
risin's the Negro convict
dreams of rotgut whisky and 
"heavy-hipted" women.

As a Louisiana ballad about a
belle blonde joins Cajun words to
the tonality of Irish folksong and
the version of the "Ram of
Darby" here presented marries
verses of British folksong to the
chorus of the immortal Cole and 
Johnson's "Oh, Didn't He Ramble?"
so do the songs of this collection 
and the editors' preceding 
volume, 1,000 pages strong, combine
to express America and the
American spirit more fully and
faithfully than any other art
form. Well edited for both words
and music, these volumes are
good books for all who love
America.
