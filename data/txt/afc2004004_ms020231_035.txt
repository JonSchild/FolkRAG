BJ TAPE 17, p. 33

        "No coat, no hat, no trousers, nothin'.  Jus' don't bother
Sam Sweet no mo'!  [That man] You know he ain't got his good sense."  He musta
torture 'er or done sumpin'.  I don't know what he done; that
was pitiful.
        That was the only time [Mama ever got in jail;] I heard talk.  Oh, I was so 
scared.  I didn't see anything, there when  [the next time] I see her,
she's in the wagon.  She was ready to go home.
        You don't stay in jail, not them kinda peoples.  Not Mama
an' them peoples.  Them real workin' peoples, you know.  You know,
peoples that don't never bother nobody an' don't never, be havin'
to stir up no. . .
AL:    They claimed she was. . .explain to Toni about that.  About
how the whole jail system works.  'Cause she wouldn't understand.
It doesn't work like that
If you go to jail, you go to jail.  And nobody gets you out.

BJ:    Yeah?  Cain't?
AL:    Huh-uh.
If you go to jail, you're in jail honey.
BJ:     Ha, ha, they mean it.
AL:    You gotta go to trial.
BJ:     O-oh.
AL:
If you're in there, you're gonna be deprived of sumpin'.
BJ:     Jus' for sumpin' anyhow.  Because if they put you in, they
make you pay for sumpin' anyhow.  'Co'se they pay for it, too,
whatever it be, the cost be. . .
AL:    Yeah but
BJ:     The plantation people will pay.
