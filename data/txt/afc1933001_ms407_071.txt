2-Tex.Jack and Sil.Jack

Yet that night we had our dinner together and afterwards Jack sung for me many
songs. Among them was the story of Silver Jack, a he-man of the West. Strangely enough 
this ballad fits either a cow camp or a lumber camp. Years before Texas Jack and the hero of another ballad sang to me by Stuart Edward White sang it for me, 
a professor of Harvard University had sent me the words and tune,saying that his father
had got it from lumber jacks in Michigan. Later Mrs. Hallie Bryan Perry of Edna,Texas,gave
me another copy. After all, there are points of resemblance in a cattle "drive" and a 
lumber "drive", and the first line of the song speaks of a drive. Here is what Texas Jack 
sang to me as he nursed his wounded wrist: 

I was on the drive in eighty
Working under Silver Jack, 
Which the same is now in Jackson [*]
And ain't soon expected back, 
And there was a fellow 'mongst us
By the name of Robert Waite, 
Kind of cute and smart and tonguey, 
Guess he was a graduate.

He could talk on any subject
From the Bible down to Hoyle,
And his words flowed out so easy
Just as smooth and slick as oil, 
He was what they call a skeptic,
And he loved to sit and weave
Hifalutin' words together
Tellin' what he didn't believe.

One day we all were settin' round
Smokin [*] head tobacco
And hearin' Bob expound; waitin for the blood to simmer
Hell, he said, was all a humbug,
And he made it plain as day
That the Bible was a fable,
And we 'lowed it looked that way.

Miracles and such like
Were too rank for him to stand,
And as for him they called the Savior
He was just a common man.
"You're a liar," someone shouted,
"And you've got to take it back."
Then everybody started, - 
'Twas the words of Silver Jack.

[And he cracked his fists together
And he stacked his duds and cried,
"'Twas in that then religion
That my mother lived and died;"
