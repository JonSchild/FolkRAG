"Our Workers"
Months before Dec. 17 our factory
worker went to work night and day.
In order to help to defend our country
if the war should strick here.
On Dec 7 funny noises like
thunder among the clouds came
raying as though the world were
coming to an end. The sky grew dark
and as the crouded streats of peoples
look up they saw hundered of
Japanic plaines coming down upon
them like a person steps on ants.
The people scattered to find shelter.
And soon the island was captured.
And that is why we are working
night and day, so that we will
be able to defend our selves when
the time comes. And so that people
like us can have freedom and liberties
like we have now.
This is the story of my version on
how Pearl Harbor came to an
end
