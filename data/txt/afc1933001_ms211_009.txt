Port Aransas, Texas,
January 9, 1939.

Dear Alan:

You may cease all your
labors (if any) in helping out
with the song substitutions for the
Macmillans. I think I can
clean up the situation from
this end.

But you can go down to 
the copyright office (or ask Frank
to do the job for me) and find
to whom and when copyrights were
granted on the following songs:
1. "The Strawberry Roan"
2. "I'd like to be in Texas when they Round
up in the Spring."
