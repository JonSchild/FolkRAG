[*Rumor*] 
Mr. R. Keith Kane                           Sept. 10, 1942

Request of Mr. Chapin of War Department concerning 
"white feather" reports.



The recent rumor study turned up quite a few 
rumors concerning draft evasion, but nothing with 
a specific "white feather" reference. There is a 
good deal of reference to Jews dodging the draft; 
getting all the good jobs, while the rest of the 
country is going to war; and this, of course, tied 
in closely with the  general, "This is a Jewish 
War." There is also some material on Negroes 
dodging the draft.

This, you may recall, is in reply to your 
memorandum of September 7th, referring to statement 
by Mr. Chapin, War Department 2740, Labor 
Relations Branch.
