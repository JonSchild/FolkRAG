Fort Worth and Dall's Blues

The prototype of a thousand blues tunes
L.B. sang it while he lived in Dallas and Forth Worth. He remembers 
that it was an especial favorite at the Big Four whore
house down near the terminal in Dallas, which wqwmde bigges'  ho' house
in de state of Texas. Me an' Blind Lemon would play dat song
an' de' ho's would come runnin' wid their dresses all up
aroun' their necks. Lawd have mercy! They'd hug us an' kiss
us so we could hardly play."

Cain' my woman, Lawd, f'om worryin' me.

Cain' lay down for dreamin', an' I jus' cain' sleep for cryin',
Cain' lay down for dreamin', an' I jus' cain' sleep for cryin',
I jus' can't wear that black woman offa my min'.

If I don' go crazy, hon', I'll go stone blin',
If I don' go crazy, hon', I'll go stone blin',
I jus' cain' wear a dat black woman offa my min'.

First time I met her, she was holdin' out her han'
First time I met her, she was holdin' out her han''
When I give her my money, she give it to her bran' new man.

Can't help a-thinkin', "Do that woman love me?"

Baby, I'm glad, hon' that I can see,
Baby, I'm glad, hon' that I can see,
You can't make no fat-mouf *outa me.

*"Fat-mouf", an exact equivalent of "cuckhold", Just as the Negro
held in contempt black skin and kinky hair, even so
he despised thick lips. A thick-lipped or "fat-moufed" person 
is a "nigger". A "nigger" is stupid and contemptable, he has
been taught. Ergo a "fat-mouf" is stupid and ugly and a 
good-looking woman is likely to be unfaithful to him,
