The face I had cherished so fondly, 
The face that had grown so dear to me.

I asked of ten thousand bright angels, 
Have you seen this beloved one, I pray tell?
Have you met in the portals of heaven
This one whom on earth I loved well? 
They shook their heads sadly and told me, 
That they never had seen you, and then
I knew that somewhere in the darkness
You had wandered lost, lost in sin.

I awoke from my dream and I prayed God
That I might not search heaven for you, 
Prayed that you and I might meet together
Somewhere in the great azure blue,
Prayed that you in the Savior believing, 
Might know His salvation so sweet, 
That you will prepare even now 
And together we will meet at His feet. 

No. 5     I'm Just As Rich As You 

You may live in mansions and ride in limousines; 
You may sit on thrones of splendor and visit  kings 
and queens. 
But death will end your pleasure if to God you've
been untrue. 
Oh, I'm joint heir to glory, I'm just as rich as  you. 

CHORUS 

I'm just as rich as you, I have a mansion too, 
Oh, I'm joint heir with Jesus and a home beyond the
blue,
