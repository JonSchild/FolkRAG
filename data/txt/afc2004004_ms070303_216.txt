Have pity tonight on my 3
children #
As I heard it - He was a farmer
this man - there was another
woman staying not far away
who was in love with this man
& she wanted to do away wtin
his wife and when the tide
was out she took her to
the rocks in the sea & it
was a lovely day what I heard and they
sat on the rocks & the wife
fell asleep & the jealous woman
saw nothing better than to tie
her hair that was at the back 
of her head to the seaweed
& the tide came & when she
woke up she was alone-- the other woman went
away when the tide made --
& she woke half drowned
when the tide went away her
