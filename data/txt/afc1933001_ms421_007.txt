JOIN THE UNION
(Tune: Keep the Home Fires Burning)

Keep the Union growing,
Members, make a showing,
Help your fellow workmen, too,
Get them to join.
There's a lot before us,
Join us in this chorus:
"Get together, organize"â€”
Help the Union grow.

UNION MEN
(Tune: Smiles)

There are men that join the Union,
They are men that know the way
To help all who earn their daily living
To find a better thing each day.
There are men and there are many women
That have found this way to be the best:
That the thing to do is join the Union,
For they know that it will stand the test.
