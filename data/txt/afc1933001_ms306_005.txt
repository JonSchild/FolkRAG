     Mr. Lomax has gathered folklore
from widely varied sources. In Alabama
he was directed to sources of
folksong by Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt,
who helped Carl Carmer collect material
which he used in the best-selling
"Stars Fell on Alabama." Mr. 
Lomax and his son Alan have visited
jails and penitentiaries throughout the 
Southern States and have interviewed
hundreds of Negros.

New Edition of "Cowboy Songs."
     In October Macmillan will publish a 
new and enlarged edition, with music,
of "Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier
Ballads," which first appeared in 1910.
Except for a pamphlet of negro spirituals,
"Cowboy Songs" was the first
copyrighted collection of native 
American ballads.
     Almost ready for publication is 
"American Ballads and Folksongs,
Volume 2," written, as was the first
volume, by John and Alan Lomax. All
the songs in this book, collected by 
the Lomaxes under grants from the
Carnegie Foundation and Library of
Congress, will be in print for the first
time. Alan Lomax, his father mentioned,
has just returned to Washington
from a trip to Haiti, where he was
making records for the Library of 
Congress. Alan is at present assistant
archivist in Library of Congress, folksong
department of the music division.
He plans to write a book on
what he saw and learned in Haiti.

His Plans for Next Year.
     Mr. Lomax declared that next year
he is going to take a real vacation;
he intends to spend a year in Europe.
In the meantime, he has been persuaded
by his publishers to set down
some of his experiences for a projected
"Reminiscences of a Ballad-Collector;"
and his experiences, if the 
matchless stories he tells can be taken
as a fair sample, are well worth recording.
     Not long ago in Arkansas Mr. Lomax
found an aged blind woman who
