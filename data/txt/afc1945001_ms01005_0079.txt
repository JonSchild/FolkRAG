Mr. Elmer Davis
Office of War Information
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Davis:

This newspaper is co-operating with
Syracuse University in establishing the Syracuse
University Rumor Clinic, patterned after the one
operating in Boston.  Professor Warren B. Walsh
of the School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at
SU is chairman of the executive committee, and another
leader is Professor Floyd H. Allport, brother of 
Professor Gordon Allport of Harvard, who has worked 
closely with the Boston project.

Every precaution will be take, of course,
to check all reports and replies with the proper
authorities, and we shall undoubtedly be calling upon
your office for assistance frequently.

The immediate problem is to educate the
public to watch for rumors of doubtful origin and to 
report them.  The September article in Reader's Digest
has already laid an excellent groundwork for us, but we
believe it would be especially helpful if you would
give us your official blessing and commendation in a 
statement that we might use in local publicity.

The committee will appreciate anything you
can do to assist us in getting started.

Cordially,
J. Leonard Gorman
