paid generously a  Library Negro to help
me. If he carries through
his plan to have penitentiary
Negroes sing direct, I feel
sure that he will be liberal
with them. I told him
how they felt. Also I recommended
Lead Belly who 
sang for him in New York
Mr. Greene chose our old
Pardon Song record in place 
of L.B.'s present list - which
bears out your judgment.

We can take our
own time with the book.
I feel sure soon I'll
write for further extension.
The present date is January 1.
