Philadelphia, Pa.
February 27, 1938.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
As I have a request on your son's desk at the moment,
I'll annoy you this time. Besides, the original suggestion
came from you.
I have finished the indexes and song-collections in the
New York public library (a fine place to work), and have gone
through most of the standard collections of folk-songs, and
JAFL. Where do I go from here? I still have many songs of
which I can either find no trace, or cannot find where they
originated. Take, for instance, "Putting on Style." This
was picked by Cox in West Virginia and also appeared in
1931 in a popular music collections of "Cowboy Songs" (called
"The Arkansas Wood-Chopper's World's Greatest Collection of
Cowboy Songs," Cole, Chicago). This helps me along, but I
would like to know where the song (and others) came from in the first place.
How do I find out? Have you any suggestions?
From what somebody said on one of my Washington visits,
there is available the catalogue of registration of published
songs, according to the Act of Congress. Could I use that
catalogue? Better still, if I sent the list of titles I want
to Mr. Spivacke, would he have them looked up, and furnish me
with author, composer, and date for each? I am so used to
doing my own research that it seems very much like exploitation
to ask Uncle Sam's librarians to do this for me--but if
it is not an imposition, I am not averse to getting a little of
this sort of relief.
Best regards to yourself, son, daughter, and daughter-in-
law.
Sincerely yours.
Kay Dealy
