Conduct of War
Coast Guard Recruiting Officer, formerly newspaper man, 8-9-42: "A city editor on the Des Moines paper came back from New York this week with the story that everyone in New York says that the gambling bookies are putting odds of 5 to 1 that we will win the war by December. Of course this is probably Nazi propaganda at work, and he thought so too." [*9*]
[*3*] Woman worker, 8-10-42: "I was told that the shipping situation is really terrible - that materiel is simply piled high in warehouses in the east and all over the country, for lack of available shipping overseas. They say that a large part of what is being sent over is sunk by the submarines. If they don't manage to stop them some way we'll never get the stuff over there." [*10*]
[*7b*] Woman worker, union, 8-10-42: "This union official told me, on the q.t. of course that the strikes don't have any real effect on production because they are already producing more than they can ship overseas or find room for in the United States. He said they like to blame it on the workers, but that in reality the strikes aren't hurting production any." [*11*]
[*1*] Young business woman, 8-10-42: "There isn't much question but that they will be drafting women before long." [*12*]
[*1*] Young matron, well educated, 8-11-42: "My brother wrote that there was a Russian boat off San Pedro that was entirely manned by women, up to and including the captain." [*13*]
Employment official. 8-15-42: "I hear quite a few people who are apparently administration haters, who say this is not our war and that we would be better off out of it." [*14*]
Employment official, 8-15-42: "I have heard it said quite often that i[s]t is just a matter of getting the election over before the young fellows are drafted." [*15*]
