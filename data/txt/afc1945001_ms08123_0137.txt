What makes Hitler
big and bold,
Is it because he's
a hundred yrs. old?
Why is Tojo so sad
about December,
Maybe it's because our
boy's have remembered 
Why is Mussolini so sad about
buying a bond,
I know it's because the
"Reds" have them on the run
All these things I would like 
to know and send 
them with a bomb to [?????].
Rumors:  
Why were the boy's so
tired on April 1st:
Who wouldn't be, after a 
March of 31 days?
