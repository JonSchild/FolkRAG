Negro Organizers
To Unionize South
By the Associated Press.
MEMPHIS, Aug. 16.â€”Twenty
Negro farmhands, taught the gospel
of unionization to the rhythm
of their own age-old spirituals,
leave here Sunday after six weeks
of preparation to take the field
as union organizers among fellow
Southern farm laborers.
They were brought here for
training by the United Cannery,
Agricultural, Packing and Allied
Workers of America, a C. I. O.
union. Tutor of the school is the
Rev. Claude Williams. Each day's
session of the school begins with
a "sing"
First the class goes into the familiar
spirituals and folk songs.
Then, without changing tempo, the
leader substitutes words suited to
the union's theme.
