Herding cattle -
I place this flock before me
As twos ordained by the king of the world
Mary Virgin to keep them, to wait on
them to watch them
On berm, on glen on plain (2)

From rocks from mow wreaths from streams
From crooked ways, from destructive pits
From arrows of the shin fairy women
(7) From the heart of envy, from the eye of wil
