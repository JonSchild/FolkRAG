do it now.  I might get in the rationed area and not be able to 
get back.  This rationing is not fair, I hear, anyway.  A salesman 
ought to have enough gas to do his work.  It don't bother me 
much, of course, because most of my territory is outside of the 
rationed area.  I don't believe that it is being rationed on 
account of any shortage but because they want to keep a lot of 
traffic off the highways so war workers and Army movements won't 
be slowed up.  I'm for anything that will win the war, but the 
people in Washington don't know enough about a lot of things to 
start rationing them the way they are.  It may be just a way to 
make them spend more for war bonds since they can't buy anything 
else."

     "I don't know why we don't start a second front in Europe.  
A man I know, who is a 'big shot' says we have enough men in 
Ireland to do it but the British keep holding up.  In my opinion, 
if we don't do something to stop the German drive on Russia, we 
may lose the war."   [*4*]
