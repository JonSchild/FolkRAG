Dear Mr. Frazier:

Mr. Harold Thompson is one of the most 
scholarly and at the same time most fertile figure
in American folk lore. His rich and salty compendium
of New York lore is a testament to a rich man ina
rich state. I shall try to place a review of the book
in some periodical. Thank you for a delightful
addition to my library.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
