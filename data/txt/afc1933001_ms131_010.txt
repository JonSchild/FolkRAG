Dear Dr. Pound:

    The Archive of American Folk Song is sending 
me to Indiana in April to make recordings of Indiana 
folk songs, and I wonder if you have any suggestions 
to offer in regard to interested individuals,
interesting regions or possible informants in Indiana
or the nearby Mid-West.

    It makes relatively little difference, I
think, whether the records I make are of songs that
have already been published or that will be published,
since, in the first case, it is important that there
be exact versions, and in the second case, the Library
will restrict the material so collected until its discoverer 
has an opportunity to publish.

    I have wanted for a long time to discuss some
of the issues you raised in your book on the ballad. I
think I have two ballads,"Po' Laz'us" and "The Grey Goose"
(they appear in partial versions in American Ballads and
Folk Songs, The Lomax one not the Pound one) which have
emerged from a complex of miscellaneous work song verses.

    I should appreciate very much any suggestions
you might make about the Indiana recording trip.

    Sincerely yours,

    Alan Lomax
