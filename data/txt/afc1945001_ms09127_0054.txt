[*A*] 

I have here a joke that was told to
me but as for anecdotes and rumors I
know of none except that people are
always saying that this and that is
being rationed and we wont be able to 
get anymore of something else. 

An actor was entertaining various army
camps and was a little bit late. 
A soldier asked him why he was so
late. 
"Because of the transportation" he said. 
"Well how did you come," the soldier
questioned. 
"Oh, I flew in a link trainer." 

A rumor is that a number of people
think that [if] the invasion of Africa
by the Americans will be the begining
of the end of the war which is hardly
possible.
