Samson
Moderately fast - strict time - well accounted

De-li-lie was a wo-man fine and fair
De-li-lie she gained old Sam-son's mind
(repeat 3 times)

A-Ve-ry plea-sant look-ing and coal black hair;
When he saw the wo-man and she looked so fine.

Chorus:
He said, and if I had-n my way
He says, and if I had-b my way.
He says and if I had-n my way
I'd tear the build-in' down.
