Nearer--
Question: Thinking about the whiskey coming up?
Morton: Plenty of whiskey in the flask. The boys would
bring it over.
Nearer my God to Thee--
(That'd be some of the harmony we'd use.)
Nearer to Thee--
The boys had some beautiful harmony they sang. Of course, we
got together and made all kinds of crazy ideas of the harmony, which
made it beautiful and made it impossible for anybody to jump in
and sing. I tell you, we had such beautiful numbers to sing
at all times. Of course, now, when the dead man would be
there, he wouldn't hear anything that we would be saying, at all, 
nothing, and, of course, we'd be going right on back to the kitchen
and get our cheese sandwiches and ham sandwiches, all 
slabbered all over with mustard and some whiskey and cans of
beer, sometimes, and, sometimes, if it was a man dead--a lot of
times the lady would be glad--you know, the wife to [of] the husband--
she would be glad he was gone and, of course, she would be having
a wonderful time also.
