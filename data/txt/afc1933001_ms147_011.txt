Mr. Alan Lomax,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Alan:

I agree thoroughly with you that we should do something
about those Folk Song Albums on Columbia.  I think we
should get right to work on it.

Now that Moses Smith has taken over the Columbia Masterworks
Department, both of us have an extremely sympathetic
ally and I think that together you both should be able
not only to get up fine albums musically, but promote them
in an unconventional yet successful manner.

As soon as I get back from California I will take up the
matter of a contract with Mr. Wallerstein and I will see
to it that you will get a contract which will not be
quite as brutal as that which Musicraft shoved down your
neck.

Best luck.

Sincerely,

John Hammond
