I don't know whether this is what you 
want or not, but when I was in Nashville, 
Tenn., last fall, there were roughly 60,000 soldiers
in the city on manouvers, and also soldiers from 
the army air crops classification center right outside 
the city. The city was swamped; you could'nt go
anywhere without seeing loads and loads of
soldiers. You could'nt see a picture show, or 
could'nt go to a dountoun restrautant. Soldiers
everywhere. They were all so lonely, as they could'nt
get any dates, being alone in a strange place, so 
many of them resorted to drink. It was pitiful
seeing so many of them in that condition, a 
girl could'nt go out on the street after 8:00 P.M.
unescoted. The restrautants would close down 
very early, because they would run out of food.
The air crops boys could'nt  assiocate with the 
infantry, there would be U.S.O dances, but only
for the air crops men. The infantry men were
really presenting a problem. You could'nt
talk to any of them, because you could'nt
tell whether they were nice boys or were
planning to steal your purse.
