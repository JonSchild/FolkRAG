The Ballad Hunter - the man who discovered "home on the Range", "Good-Bye 
Ol' Paint", "Git along, Little Dogies", and "The Boll Weevil". The man who has spent 
a lifetime searching for the stirring and melodious songs that belong to the American 
people. Now, at last you can hear some of the thousands of folk songs recorded in the 
field by John A. Lomax, author of "Cowboy Songs", "American Ballads and Folk Songs."
