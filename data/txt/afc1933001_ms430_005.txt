Jakie and Andy were two stingy bosses.
They sweated their workers, then talked about
"losses".
Till up rose the workers and went out on strike
And said to the bosses. "Your chiselling we'll
spike"

Jack and Jill 
Worked in a mill.
They suffered under slavery.
The workers sought
A raise and fought.
They won through union bravery.

A diller, a dollar, the boss made a holler,
"Why do you stop so soon?
You used to work straight through till six;
Now you stop for lunch at noon."
