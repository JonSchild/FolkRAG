your friends. I'm going myself 
as soon as I get through 
the operetta I'm directing.
Thanks a lot of the names.

I'm having a very gay
time - the only thing is 
I'm wildly jealous of you 
and [you] all your projects.
Don't you think I could go 
and study the South for 
you? After all - you've 
got [off] Brazil --

I love you very much.
Do come if you can - wire
me. I'm coming quick to visit 
after camp if I have any 
money.
Bess
