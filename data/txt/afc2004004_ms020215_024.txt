BJ:   (Con't.)   an' jus' shoutin' an' as the chirrun come on up
out the water, she' jus' take ahold to 'em, an' jus' enjoyin' 
Jesus, through the spirit of God.   An' they would really be happy
over that.   They be singin', ya know.   Sang this same song.   An' 
the chirrun jus', around and about, they jus' shoutin' an ' goin' --
hit was real, you know, amazin' to see how that they would, ya know
get in the spirit over, over this song.   But Aunt Mae Jack was
very, very sincerely an' she would be to the water jus' like the
deacon, I mean like the preachers.   She'd meet 'em at the edge of
the water, reach in aft' the children, reach in and kep' pushin' em on
into the water an' reachin' to bring 'em out, ah, when they be
baptizin' 'em.   And study singin' this sing about "Go wash in the 
beautiful stream.
        When they come out, she say, "Now, dear chile, now you done wash
in the beautiful stream an' you keep it clean."   Ha, ha ha!
She was wonderful!   An' she mean keep clean 'cause 'cause, you done washed
in the  beautiful stream, an' so she wanted 'em to keep clean.
That was her word.   "Now, dear chile, you done wsahed in the beautiful
stream, now you keep it clean!"    Um, ha, ha ha.   An' ah, "You
done washed in the beautiful stream [and] now you keep clean there."
That mean keep your heart and your soul clean.
AL:     You talked about how you used to imitate her.
BJ:      Oh Yeah!   We would go home an' mock -- ha, ha, ha -- we would
go home an' mock Aunt Mae Jack at, at, after the week, the next
week, me an' my cousin an' other children would go down in the 
field an' we would jus' mock Aunt Mae Jack.   We'd put on our old
long dresses an' things; we'd just mock her.   An' [how] mock her, how she
would do, ya know, how she would sing:
         Go wash in the beautiful stream,
         Ful stream,
