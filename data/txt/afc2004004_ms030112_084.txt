TAPE 2
MRS. DAVIS:
Supposed to come out here Saturday and when they called my two daughters were here, so I didn't think of telling them where I was, so they said I don't know where Grandma is and so they didn't come.
LARRY:
Ah, Mrs. Davis, getting back to the time when you were first meeting with Rev. Davis and all that, was his mother or father still alive at that time.
MRS. DAVIS:
[It was in the 60â€™s when I met his parents,] I know what their names are, the mothers Evelina Davis, and his father's name John Davis, but I never met them. I used to hear him speak about them, he had a brother.  I used to hear him say what happened to his brother.
LARRY:
What happened to his brother?
MRS. DAVIS:
His brother was killed, you know, you heard him say about his brother a number of times. Always sort of leave that out don't have to say anything.
LARRY:
So, I guess his mother and father passed away when he was
very young. 14 or something like that.
