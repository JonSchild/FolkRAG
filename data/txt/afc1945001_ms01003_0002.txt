April 29, 1942

Dear Mr. Elder:

I must apologize for the delay in answering your
letter of April 14. I have looked into the situation
about which you write. I am unable, of course, to speak
officially or even informedly regarding the plans of the
Office of Education. I do know that for budgetary and
policy reasons the Office of Facts and Figures does not
contemplate participation at this time or in the forseeable
future in such a program as that presumably outlined to you
by Mr. Williams of the Office of Education.

I think Mr. Williams' statement as quoted in your
letter of April 13 that "the plan is temporarily suspended,
but the Washington agencies involved have not abandoned it"
is true. The plan is suspended but it is not abandoned, in
the sense that if and when conditions so change as to make
the plan feasible and desirable it certainly will be
reconsidered with a view to its being put into effect.
I think that for all practical purposes at this time, however,
in terms of your own plans for participation, you might well
forego any expectation of the plan being soon put into effect.

Sincerely yours,
Robert Huse,
Executive Officer,
Office of Facts and Figures

Mr. J. H. Elder,
Assistant Professor of Psychology,
Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana
