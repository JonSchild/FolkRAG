New Offensive Campaigns Looked for on War Fronts

When Josef Stalin sent his message to the Red army
he emphasis that the Red Army is not an
invasion force and that it is organized and
maintained for the purpose of keeping invaders
out. There are rumors that we may have a
second front in Northern Europe, probably
Norway. Could this be true? It might Norway
might prove an inviting field for invasion
because the Germans are having difficulty along
their northern line. There have been reports that
Finland, foreseeing the time when the Germans
will probably be obliged to retire from the
northern front. Of course it isn't true that the
Russians is bearing the weight of the war. If it
weren't for the Americans pressure the Japanese
would have probably attacked Russia
long ago. The Russins have, however borne
the chief brunt of the fighting and they have
lost a lot. The New York Herald and Tribune believes
that Russia will continue to cooperate with
us in winning the war and safe guarding
the peace if we meet her half way.
