Hitler and Mussolini's Day in the Country.

One day Hitler and Mussolini were driving in the country, when all of a sudden they ran over a dog, who was crossing the road.
   Hitler said, to Mussolini, "Go to the farmhouse and tell the people that their dog is dead."
   So Mussolini went to the farmhouse, and stayed so long that Hitler got worried.  But all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky came Mussolini loaded down with meats, fruits, etc.
   Hitler said, "Did you tell the people that their dog is dead?"
   Mussolini answered, "All I said was, 'Heil Hitler, the dog is dead.'"
