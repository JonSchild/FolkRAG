War Stories
A group of Londoners were
huddled together in a
shelter during an air raid.
The bombs were falling at an
alarming rate but one lady,
blessed with a fatalistic
philosophy, turned to a little
man beside her, shrugged.
"It's no use worrying - if my
name's on a bomb, I'll get it."
The little man wasn't impressed.
That's all very well for you.
But my name is Smith."

Two Germans were talking
together and the first German
said that Hitler wants peace."
And so the second German said
"Ach! Peace? Is it true?" The first
German said "Ja. A piece of
England, a piece of France, and a
piece of Russia."
