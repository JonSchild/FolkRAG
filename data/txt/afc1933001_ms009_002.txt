Mr. Engel:
Alan and I leave early
Monday for New York
to turn over our manuscript 
to Macmillan.
We have left the machine
in good order; also all
the records except a
few to show to Mr. Garwick.
I will try to
arrange to come back
with him when he makes
his visit here.  Let me
know c/o Mr H. S. 
Latham 60 5th Ave. when
you will come over
to New York - Hurriedly,
Lomax
