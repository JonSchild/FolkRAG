strong an' mo' better an' mo' uplifted. No doubt you had a whole
lot of burden that day; somethin' could be on your mind, or somethin',
an' somethin', ya, you know...But just a heap a things
could come. 'Cause, really, ah, when you tryin' an'ya done all
ya can for, for the Lawd, you , you do want to he'p others, you

oh, seem to be gifted deeper, will be right with 'em with their
hands on 'em or sumpthin'. Sometimes two or three of 'em. But,
you know, around 'em.
