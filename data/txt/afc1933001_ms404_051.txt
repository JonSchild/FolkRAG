They had me tied with a ball and chain,
Waitin' all ready for de Eastbound train,
and every station we passed by,
Seemed like I hear little Ida cry,
Oh, weep, oh, my Ida
For over that road I'se bound to go.

If I'd a-listened to what Ida said,

But I paid no mind to my Ida Red
And now I'se sleepin' in a convict's bedâ€” 
Oh, weep, Oh, my Ida,
For on that road I'se bound to go.

I wash my face an' I comb my head,
I'm a- mighty fool about Ida Red,
When I git out-a this old shack
Tell little Ida I'se a-comin' back.
Oh, weep, Oh, my Ida
For over that road I'm bound to go.
