Music

Route 2,
East Stroudsburg, Pa..

Dear Duncan,

There must be ten or fifteen Haitian records in the
pile of duplicates, but I suppose they are so labelled that
only A.L. could recognize them.  Then the express company
did the rest.  The whole business was quite a fiasco, [but]  Sorry
I bothered you.

Perhaps the thing to do is to ask the Bloomington
office to return the record directly to you. That would save
a three cornered trip for the poor old thing.

This has been up till now a busy summer for me.
June on the ballad book. July for the conference. Now
August a month in the country with my wife and little daughter.
We are departing for a two weeks camping trip on Lake George
in the hope that our city suet will be turned into a bit of
muscle.  September to work again---hard.

My very best to you and yours,
Alan
