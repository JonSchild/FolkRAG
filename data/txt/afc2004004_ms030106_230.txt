Well, I touched up and down the Gulf Coast a good bit and
once when I was playing at the Old Flat Top in Biloxi, I happened
to write "Alabama Bound".  The Flat Top was nothing but an old
honky-tonk, where nothing but the blues was played.  A lot od piano
stompers used to hang around there, fellows like Bradsy, Johnny,
Florida Sam, Skinny Head, Pete and Trigger Sam.  They used to sing
songs like,
"Now, all you gals better get out and walk,
Cause I'm gonna start my dirty talk".
I'm Alabama bound,
Alabama bound.
I can't wait til the sun goes down,
I gotta leave this town.
All the girls began to do the high kicks, said, "My, my, play
that thing boy".  I'd say, I'll certainly do it, lil' girl".  Then
I began to sing.
Well, that rooster crowed,
And the hen run around, 
If you want me baby,
You gotta run me down.

This was wrote in 1905.  Of course, I never got any credit fo
it.  In those days, we didn't copyright our tunes and I'll tell you
why.  The fact was that the sporting houses were all over the country
and you could make plenty money, especially, if you had a lot of tricky
new numbers so you could show up the other musicians.  Just as soon
as you hit town, you had ten jobs waiting for you and fifteen or twenty
dollars a night was just chicken-feed.  We kept a lot of tunes for 
private material, to battle each other in battles of music.
