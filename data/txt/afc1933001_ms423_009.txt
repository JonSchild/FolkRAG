ONE BIG UNION FOR TWO, continued

can't be wrong! When we have joined up per-haps ther'll be, A new re-cruit or

two or three, For that's what team-work can do -    In One Big Un-ion for Two.

2nd Chorus

We won't have sit-downs inside our gate,
W'll never need to arbitrate
In One Big Union for Two, -
We'll have no look-outs to make us frown,
No scabbing when when I'm out of town
In One Big Union for Two. -

Will you pay your dues? They're very light,
A kiss each day a kiss each night,
Our life will be a song, for!
Fifty million union members can't be wrong!

When we have signed up and made the grade,
We'll add a member -- union made,
Who looks like me and like you --
In One Big Union for Two.

TO LABOR
(Tune: Maryland, My Maryland)

I.
Shall you complain who feed the world,
Who clothe the world,who house the world,
Shall you complain who are the world,
Of what the world, the world may do?

As from this hour you use your power,
The world must follow, follow you.
(REPEAT)

II.
The world's life hangs on your right hand,
Your strong right hand, your skilled right
hand.
You hold the whole world in your hand,
See to it what you do, you do.

Or dark or light, or wrong or right,
The world is made, is made by you.
(REPEAT)

III.
Then rise as you ne'er rose before,
Nor hoped before, nor dared before,
And show as ne'er was shown before
The power that lies, that lies in you.

Stand still as one, see justice done,
Believe and dare, and dare and do.
Stand all as one, see justice done!
Believe and dare, and dare and do!
