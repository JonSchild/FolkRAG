Dear Mr Lomax, 
following up the despatch of 337 songs which I sent you recently,
I now forward 100 of my earlier series.  This leaves 146 songs to send and I am
working at them with a view to early completion of my promise.
In a broadcast “Music of Britain-collected by Sam Henry” which I put across
on May 11th on four wavelengths ( short waves ) I mentioned that I had sent over
300 songs to the Library of Congress.  I wonder if any one heard me on your side.
I trust that all the songs will reach you safely.
Yours sincerely
Sam Henry.
