Rumor
   "Hitler is dead" that is
the rumor that has been
going around.  Is it true?
If not, why is it that
we haven't heard about
him since November?
Why is it that he didn't
give his anniversary speece?
Why is it that Berlin and
the other main German
country have been bomed
and Hitler haven't raised
a hand to do any thing about
it?
   These are the questions
that have been going through
the American people mind.
Is this rumor true?
Is Hitler dead?
