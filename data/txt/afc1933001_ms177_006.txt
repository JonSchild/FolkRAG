Dear Mr. Lomax:
Thanks very much for your note of
December 2nd.  The remaining balance on your publicity
account is $96.17.  You will remember that
you agreed to pay $20. per engagement to be applied
on this account.
The fee for your appearance on Oct.
6th in Newark, New Jersey was $100; our commission
on this date is $25.
We shall greatly appreciate it if you
will let us have your check for the commission plus
the $20. to be applied to your publicity account as
soon as possible.
With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
Mary Jo Wallace
