To Give Recital Of Folk Songs Native To This Country  [[Title]]

Alan Lomax of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., will give a recital of American folk songs next Wednesday evening (July 8) at 8 o'clock.  Mr. Lomax's recital is being given as one of the summer convocation attractions of the University and will be in the auditorium with the public invited.

Mr. Lomax is one of the country's foremost authorities in the field of folklore and is on the campus until July 11 in connection with the summer institute of folklore now being held at the University.

A native of Texas, Lomar's acquaintance with native music began at home, as his father, John A. Lomax, is the author of "Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads" and began the Library of Congress Archive that now comprises some 12,000 titles.

The younger Lomax went to Terrill Preparatory School, Dallas, to Choate School, had a year at Harvard and took his A.B. at the University of Texas.  His first solo expedition for folklore material was made in 1936 in Haiti.  In 1939, he inaugurated the "Well-Springs of America" Series broadcast on Columbia's School of the Air.  He also collaborates with director Nicholas Ray on the popular CBS feature "Back Where I come From," featuring folk singers, tall tales and local lore.
