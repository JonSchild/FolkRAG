Port Aransas, Texas
3/26/1939

Dear Mr. Spivacke:
    This bunch is my present choice, though you might wait until
I hear from San Antonio again. I'll shoot the letter on as soon
as it comes, at least by the middle of the week. By then Mr.
Thornbush will have information enough to make his own choice
direct. I hope he will take over at once all further
correspondence.
    The San Angelo bunch are a robust group of Westerners,
nearly all some of cattlemen. Mr. Thornbush, I suppose, can get
some idea of their performance by having Mr. Broome send on some
sample records. They dress their parts, though, as a matter of
fact, they are all, probably, college graduates.
    X X X X X X
Your wire came a week ago. No machine as yet. I am still
hoping.
    Always sincerely,
    John A. Lomax
