[(Do you know what I mean by that?) (Well),] he was one of 
the known men, this steward, but he didn't get feed in the 
forenoon. He's either ask a pound too much or he just had 
missed getting fee-ed, and I got him through the afternoon 
and I thought I would get him to go to my father, you see.
I knew the man. I was always well up in that kind of thing
and.....)
Well, he wouldn't stay anyway, but why he was not
staying I can't tell you. He wasn't staying to his farm
you see...[... and he...... oh, we would..... well, I got
him told. [*cue*]
Now my father would part with fifty pounds far easier
than he would throw threepence and sixpence about. He wasn't
a shabby man by any means, if it came to a big thing, but he
couldn't throw pennies about. For instance, he would have
thought it a bloody insult to tip a waiter a penny as we
used to do. He would have just thought that was an insult.
He couldn't do that.......]
Well, well..... (slight laugh)...... I told this man
if he got anything he would maybe get an odd pound but I
didna promise that. ["Oh" I said] "You'll get your tea every
time you take around that horse" and that was something at
that time. You've no idea how they were fed. [And he
would get tea maybe, and a piece of cake butt (Laugh)
as we called it, with jam and butter on it, and that was
on thing he'd notice that his strapper got this and he was
real particular about his horse - I mean if she would not
stand or anything. I told him "For God's sake don't hit
her unless my father be there......." Weel.... (Laugh)....
Och, you know, I'm nae telling this........]
Well, well... but anyway the man - I think I see him
yet - [he stood up and] he looked at the ground. This
was in the square at the Old Meldrum, and he gave the boot foot
