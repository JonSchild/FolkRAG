17   Now, you'll have to put your guns on your shoulders an' come by me,
An' come in a hurry,
Come trottin',
Come laughin',
Come like you gonna get paid for it,
Get a move on you,
An' go by the water tank and get you some water.
Git your linin' bars an' git your backbreakin' holts,
Throw it north.

Got a pa'in in your si'de.

OH, ROLL ON, BABE

In eastern Kentucky, this son is said to have been made up when the
L. & N. Railroad was pushed through the mountains, and local opinion is
divided as to whether the "composin'" was done by whites, Negroes, or
both. Mention of John Henry in many versions and its close textual and
melodic connection with other Negro work songs, however, indicates its
origin is probably Negro, although it has now become a standard part of the
repertory of Southern banjo pickers and is sung, so far as we know, exclusively
by them.

The following stanzas that occur in other versions indicate its worksong
origin more clearly than does the banjo version printed here in full.

I looked at the sun and the sun looked red,
I looked at my partner and he was almost dead.

This old hammer killed John Henry,
But it can't kill me, buddy, it can't kill me.

Chorus:
Oh, roll on babe, don't roll so slow,
When the sun goes down, you'll roll no more.

1 I dremp last night poor Lulu was dead
And her apern strings tied around my head.

Oh, roll on, babe, and make your time,
My wheel's broke down, and I can't make mine.

2  I asked that girl to be my bride;
She said she would before she died.

Oh, roll on, babe, and do your best,
When the sun goes down, sit down and rest.

3  I looked at the east, and I looked at the west,
I looked at the girl that I love best.
