Mr. John A. Lomax

Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Alan asked me to write you about the proposed expedition to Livingston, Alabama, in cooperation with Mrs. Tartt. This project has been approved informally, but there are still certain questions which must be settled before I can give you definite word.

I know that you will not wish Mrs. Tartt to have difficulty in obtaining reimbursement, and therefore I must make doubly sure that there is no misunderstanding before allowing this expedition to start. I hope to have the matter settled in the not too distant future and will write you soon again.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
