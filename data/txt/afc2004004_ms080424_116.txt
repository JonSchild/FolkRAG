bad, I guess I killed 15, 20 cats here in the last two years.
People throw them out, you know, and they get in the pen and 
start catching our rabbits.  We have to work to keep the
predators down.  But the main thing we found is the rabbits - if
he got plenty to eat, he don't multiply.  Usually, a rabbit will
have four to five litters a year, gestation ain't but 32, 28 days
for rabbits, and 3 days after they have their little ones, they
breed right back.  Nothing unusual for a three months old
rabbit, that's born in the spring of the year to breed before
the year is out, and have one or two litters, see.  That's why. . . .
oh, they got him going now.  I believe they gonna go up the other
side.  Yup, they going to the fence.  They gonna be gone before
we get there, though.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They got him in that corner there.  Looks to me like. . . . . .
AL:  When you were growing up, catching rabbits was necessary,
wasn't it?
Man:  My daddy trained me, you hear everybody talking about
Hoover days, my daddy trained right from when we was young boys,
I was trained to run right long side, reach down feel to see if
she was fat enough to catch or just let her go.  And I got out of
shape now, I ain't hardly as fast as I used to be, but I still
love rabbits hunting.  Man., you just can't explain -- if you got
something youreally love to do- this would be mine. I love to
hunt, fish. . . .life wasn't noting but hunting, fishing, ball games,
making music, that's my life's desire, right there.
