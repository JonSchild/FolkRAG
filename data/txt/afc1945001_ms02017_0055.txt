RUMORS, AUGUST 3 THROUGH AUGUST 8, 1942
(Sixth Report for Bureau of Intelligence, Office of War Information)

Summary:  Study of rumors current in Alabama during the period August 3 through
August 8 indicated economic and political interests influence the types of rumors
current in particular areas.  For instance Montgomery, State capitol located in
Alabama's Black Belt farm area, was seething with rumors concerning racial relations.
Feeling in Montgomery about the Negro was brought to a boil when the Governor announced
rejection of a war contract for cloth made by the State prison system, as a clause
prohibiting discrimination in employment because of race would "break down segregation"
and end White supremacy in Alabama.  The matter was discussed by Black Belt
newspapers with a great deal of heat, all but one of them supporting the Governor's
"courageous" stand.

In Birmingham, on the other hand, rumors dealt largely with the prosecution of
the war and rationing.

We have included in this report only such rumors as were heard first-hand by this
office, reporting only one time a rumor which other persons may have declared they
heard several times.  Nor was an effort made to stimulate the flow of rumors.  Only
those that were spontaneous were recorded.

I.  Military Development:  "The United States is flying planes from Maine to England
    and there is going to be a big drive in October."  (Wife of ferry pilot, Montgomery,
    August 8, 1942.)

    "The big push is coming in October.  I know a lady whose husband is flying planes
    to Europe and she says they are getting ready for an invasion."  (Housewife,
    Montgomery, August 8, 1942.)

    "I think the war will be over this year.  If you knew what I know you would
    think so too.  The Government is planning something big and it is coming up
    the fall."  (Union Official, Birmingham, August 4, 1942.)
