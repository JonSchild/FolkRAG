"Back in the U.S.A.
1. "When this war is over,
"And our victory is won,
"We'll  sail again the deep
"To our homes we fought to keep.
"Our troubles will be over,
"The world once more will rest,
"Back in the U.S.A." 

2. Here are a few messages Chicago boys in
North Africa wrote home:

a. "I'm playing with the winning team." 
b. "Weather's fine, so's the wine; can't say
more, au revoir."
c. "Second down, Goal to go. Victory soon."
d. "The dark eyes of the Mediterranean water
can't replace. Old Dearborn's daughter."
e. "I'm enjoying my cruise at government 
expense."
