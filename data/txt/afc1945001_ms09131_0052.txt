The four Marines were having a card
game on an island in the South Seas when
another one comes tearing in with the
announcement that 200 Japs have landed.
The four look at each other and one says
"That's O.K. fellows, I'll go. I'm dummy
this hand."
We hear all kinds of jokes etc about
the war but I'll be damned if I can
think of any now.
