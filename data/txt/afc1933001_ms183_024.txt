Memorandum

To [the Chief of the] Dr. Botkin
Music Division

June 25, 1942

Yesterday at your request I conferred with Mr. Clapp about the matter
of obtaining full clearances for all recordings in the field.  I
explained to him that this would make for great difficulties in our field
work and that in certain respects it was inconsistent with our main
purpose, which is, I judge, scientific.

Mr. Clapp thereupon asked me to inspect the records upon my return and
write for as many clearances at that time as I judged would ever be
necessary.  It seems to me that this is the most efficient way to handle
this problem.

Respectfully yours,

Alan Lomax
