orchestras, weren't they?  I mean everybody was playing
pieces of them or using them when they'd play.

ROSE             Oh yeah, of course.

LOMAX          And this was the material judgment
used in the so called improvisational. . . .

ROSE             Much of the material.

LOMAX          Right.  I mean the, the
rhythmic. . .

ROSE              Yeah, right.

LOMAX          Right.  Right.

ROSE             But of course the bands, too. . . .

LOMAX          Like the Indian song.

ROSE             Yeah.  I, I need to point out to

LOMAX          Why are you mentioning Stale Bread

Stale Bread played long enough so that I had the opportunity
to hear him in later years.
