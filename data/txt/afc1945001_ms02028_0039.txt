Army War Show

Housewife, 8-13-42: "It seems queer to me that we should spend so much money on
[*1*] the Army War Show if the war is in as strenuous condition as it's supposed to be."

[*1*] Young business man, 8-13-42: "The War Show is just a lot of waste of money."

Business man repeating Des Moines Club reaction, 8-13-42: "They criticize the
Army War Show almost to the point of violence, on the basis that it is ridiculous
[*1*] to be holding up that amount of men and equipment if we are losing the war. If
the need is for money for the group that is supposed to get the proceeds, then
the cost is ridiculously higher than the income. It is hard to see how they can
afford to spend the money and use the men and equipment for a circus at a time
when our war situation is so urgent."

Military man, 8-14-42: "It's hard to understand why they use so much equipment
[*1*] and men and expense for such an unnecessary use as the Army War Show."

Young business woman, 8-15-42: "Everyone thinks the Army War Show is just a 
[*1*] circus and is a terrible waste of money and that they oughtn't to have it."
