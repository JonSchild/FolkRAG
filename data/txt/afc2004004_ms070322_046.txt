how to be kind & friendly. At
least Bridson & Gilliam of the BBC
know. Under their aegis I'm beginning
a series of ballad operas for
April, May & June which may
save my soul. And redeem me
from Father, Mother, Elizabeth,
Robin, & them all. I feel in my
bones that they will be good.
From now on I must make a
practice of putting down real observations
in these diary pages - just as they 
happen. If not, I tend to put 
aside the really vivid stuff of
my life, hiding it away under
my anxiety about Robin. I need 
a drink.
P.S. The Irish album, done, copied, sent
off to D. O'Sullivan for annotating. I'd
better pick up the typewriter & send him
a note right off...
