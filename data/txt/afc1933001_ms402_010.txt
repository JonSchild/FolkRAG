DINK

"Today ain't my singing day" she would reply to my urging.  Finally, a
bottle of gin, bought at the plantation commissary, nearby, loosed her muse.
The quart of liquor soon disappeared.  She sang as she scrubbed the dirty clothes
of her man, the pathetic story of a woman deserted by her lover when she needs
him most- a very old, too common, a moving story; and with a refrain which
Dink ended with a subdued cry of despair and longing- the sobbing of a woman
deserted by her man:

"One o' dese days, an' it won't be long,
You call my name an' I'll be gone.
Fare0you-well, O honey, fare-you-well:

'Member one night, a-drizzling rain,
'Round my heart I felt a pain.
Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well:

I got a man an' he's a long and tall,
Moves his body like a cannon ball,
Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well:

When I wo' my apron low,
Couldn't keep you fum my do;.
Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well:

Now I wears my apron high, 
Scarcely ever see you passin' by.
Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well:

If I had listened to whut my mamma said,
I'd a-been sleepin' in mamma's bed.
Fare-you-well, O honey, fare-you-well:


And while Dink, gin-encouraged, sang this song in the Brazos bottoms
of Texas, as she washed her temporary man's clothes, her little two-year-old
nameless son played in the sand at ther feet.  "He ain't got no daddy and I
ain't had no time to hunt up a name for him."

"Do you love this man of yours, Dink" Imasked.  She scrubbed a garment.
