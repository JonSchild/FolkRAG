Tape:  Sacred Harp  #245 cont.       2

AL:  How far did you get in school, Chester?
Chester:  5th grade, that's as far as I got. Got tired
and bored in school. I was bored before I started. But
I was the oldest child at home, and my daddy had a hard time,
and I was the one that would have to help him. . . .. . . . . . . .
AL:  You were talking about how your father. . . you really
got bored with school, huh?
Chester:  Yes, I did, because my school mates that went
regular to school, they got a grade ahead of me, so I just
quit school after I got 16 years old, I quit, and I didn't
get any more schooling. The learning I got was experience,
through life. And that's been great education to me, cause
I grew up being with the public- that's the kind of schoolin
I had- not very much.
AL:  Also, you knew all about Sacred Harp, too.
Chester:  Well, that's the way I was brought up. Down there
where I lived, we didn't have too much other singing. My
mother's people were Sacred Harp singers and my father's people
were Sacred Harp singers, and we just grew up that way. That's
all we knew.
AL:  How old were you when you began to lead?
Chester:  I would say 8 year old, now that's just a guess, I
guess I was about 8 year old. We went to the singing school
and I was very small- I remember that. It would embarass me
to get up in front of the congregation, but I learned to love it
