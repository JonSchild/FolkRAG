for her services.
d. Until she becomes an expert
stenographer I think
Bess could make a dandy
"front" man for my office.
She has personality, tact,
breeding (from her mother), sympathy,
and just enough
timidity to make her
charming. Show her to
Mr. MacLeish and Dr. Evans and
I do not think they'll
let her get away from
the Library. C.B.S. don't
know what they are
missing or they would
grab her.
e.  In my judgment you 
will do yourself a wrong
and Bess a grievous wrong
if you put her into a C.I.O.
