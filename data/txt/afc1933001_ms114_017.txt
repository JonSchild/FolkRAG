Friday.


Dearest Family:
Everything is going along very smoothly and
beautifully just like I was sure it was. We all were
left in somewhat of a daze because of your swift departure
and I still don't like it one bit and I am so afraid it was
because we could not make you comfortable and feel that
you wee crowding us. Perhaps the best solution would be
a li ttle guest house out in the back, the grass won't
grow out there anyway and I could move the woodpile. Then
if we have to go to war we would have plenty of room no
matter how many came.
We are very dispirited about the Tech money, it
all went to the surgeons this time and we did not get a
cent. Something will have to be worked out about it too
for not even Bob and Fred got any recompense for the millions
of tech work they did. Chris is just wild..
Your other daughter is the dear sweet person she
has always been. I have not suceeded in getting her a date
yet but I am on my way. Peggy has been nice to her and she
and I plan to have a luncheon for her next week. They are
going to a picn8c supper at the church tonight and maybe
that will help. She has been studying hard and I think
doing well, she has an hour quiz this morning. So far the
room business is doing well as far as I can tell and Jim
has offered her basement for when it gets hot since Dotty
