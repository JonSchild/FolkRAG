There's 9 of you, there's one of me
It's an unequal marrow [mar-o(?)]
But I'll ficht you all 1 by 1
On the Dowie Dens of Yarrow

And there they flew
And there he slew and there he wounded sorely
Till her brother J he came in beyond
And wounded him most[ly] foully.

O [npave] fa[i]ther I hae dreamed a dream
Al I [O] think it will mean sorrow
Al I dreamed i was pu' in [He] my heathen bell
On the D Dens of Yar-

O dochter dear i read [a reid] your dream
Al I think it will prove sorrow
For your true love John lies pale and wan
On the D Dens of Yarrow

As she walked up yon hi [SL] hi [SL] hill
And doun[d] by the hounds o' Yarrow
There she saw her lover John
Lying pale & wan on Yarrow
