The minkman's bell goes ting-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling,
The minkman's bell goes ting-a-ling-a-ling, 
Early in the morning.

He shouts up the stair:  Are ye wanting any milk?
Are ye wanting any milk?  Are ye wanting any milk?
He shouts up the stair:  Are ye wanting any milk?
Early in the morning.

They shout down the stair:  No, we don't want any milk,
We don't want any milk:  We don't want any milk,
They shout down the stair:  No, we don't want any milk,
Early in the morning.

Mother, mother, I am ill
Send for the doctor up the hill
Up the hill is far too far
Then we'll buy a motor car
A motor car is far too dear
Then we'll buy a pint of beer
A pint of beer is far too strong
Then we'll buy a treacle scone
A treacle scone is far too tough
Then we'll buy a box of snuff
A box of sunff makes you sneeze
Then we'll buy a pound of cheese
A pound of cheese will make you sick
So send for the doctor, quick, quick, quick.

When I was single I used a powder puff
Now I am married I cannie get the stuff
Oh,  it's a life, a weary, weary life -
It's better to be single than to be a married wife.

 One shouts Mammy, give me a piece on jam
The other shouts Daddy, put me in the pram,
Oh,  it's a life, a weary, weary life,
It's better to be single than to be a married wife.

One shouts Mammy,  put me to my bed,
The other shouts Daddy, scratch my wooden leg,
Oh,  it's a life, a weary, weary life,
It's better to be single than to be a married wife.

Punch and Judy ran a race
Judy stopped to tie her lace
Who won?
Punch!
