Dear Alan,

It was a nice surprise
getting your letter after all
this time. I am glad to hear
that you are still wandering
about and it is about time
you wandered up to Glasgow
again. I see Mary McPherson
from time to time and
she was telling me that you
haven't been here for ages.
It seems you have become a
real 'sassanach.'

Well, as you
know I am married and 
living in Glasgow all the time
now. We have a son he's 
thirteen months old. We speak
Gaidhlig to him all the time
and soon he will be singing
