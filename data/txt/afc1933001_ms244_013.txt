Bessie Smith story, perpetrated
or condoned by representative
people of the South. I talked
with Professor Brown several
times and at length. He is an
idealist and thinks of the Negro
not as what he is but what
he would like him to be. And
his first hand information
is scanty. That he is unreliable
is shown in his circulating
in public addresses
such an outrageous slander
on the Southern white man.
As an honest man he would [have]
first have investigated the the truth of
the story. Even hearsay truth
must be life's guiding star.
No permanent reform can be
based on a lie.

Your father,
John A. Lomax
