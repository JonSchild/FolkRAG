"Recently a transport was sunk in the Pacific.  Some of
the lifeboats put out were filled with Negroes and some
were filled with Whites.  The Japanese submarine which 
had sunk the transport came to the surface and shelled
the boats filled with Whites but dropped food and directions
to the boats filled with Negroes

"I have heard this rumor from doctors, educators, clergymen
and workers in various places in the country.  The story 
is always the same; the source of the story is always
described as being a Negro sailor from that particular
locality who was on the scene.  My feeling that this is 
one thread of a systematic Axis line is based on the fact 
that the rumor is widespread and is almost identical 
wherever it is heard."
