can make great money by, ah, sellin'.  'Cause folks don't wanna
walk them miles to a sto'.  An' they, an' they'll let ya sell in
they fields to keep the folks from leavin' the fields.  'Cause
a lot of 'em leave the field, they ain't comin' back.  You see?
'Cause it's so far to go an' they, an', an', an' they'll, they
already done made some money an' they ain't got to go back, ya see?
Because it's not a, it's not a, a day's work, not a hour's work; it's
piece work.  An' so they rather for you to come out there [an'] in
they fields an' sell, ya know?  Fer the hands, so the hands can,
ah, stay in the fields.
