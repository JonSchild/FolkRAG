I STARTED OUT TO FIND ME A BETTER HOME
(I BOWED ON MY KNEES AND I PRAYED)

I have made up in my mind
To pray while the prayin' time,
Lord, I[ bowed]'ll bow on my knees (2)
And I [prayed.]'ll pray.
 
I have made up in my mind
To pray while the prayin' time, 
Lord, I'll bow[ed] on my knees
And I [prayed]'ll pray.

I started out 
To find me a better home
In that old,
That old Jerusalem Land,
 
CHORUS: 
And I made up in my mind
To pray while the prayin' time,
Lord, I bowed on my knees
And I prayed.

They tell me I've a sister,
She used to shout and pray,
We thought she had religion
Until she come to die.
And you ought to 'heard her tell
How she made up her bed in hell;
Lord, I was bowed on my knees
And I prayed;
Yes, I bowed on my knees 
And I prayed     (CHORUS)
