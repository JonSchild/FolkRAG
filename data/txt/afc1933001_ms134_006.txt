Letter dated June 1 from

British Empire Building
620 Fifth Avenue
New York City; with attached letter from
Mr. Alistair Cooke.

I recommend thet the records requested by Mr. Cooke be sent to him in New York for purposes of duplication. Although it is inadvisable to send original discs out of the Archive, an exception might be made in this case. The records can be sent express collect with a valuation sufficiently large to cover the cost of recording an equal number of songs.
