and the Chambers', Dan Chambers and them, they give tents
for the union women to take their children in.  Company
throwed them out of the houses, outdoors, and they had
no furniture in it.  People'd give them a quilt, throw
'em right down on the dirt, lay the children on them.  And
people would give the children milk to drink.  Men be out\
on the hill fighting, you know. . . . . . . . .had a canteen hanging
on the side about like one of these things here, full of
kerosene. . . . . . And they come into the tent, and punch the
women around and kick the quilts all around, and take
kerosene and pour it on the children's milk, starve them
children they wouldn't have no milk to drink.  I wrote this
song about it. ( he sings)
WellI'm going to that high green mountain
Going back to old green mountain hills
I'm gonna fight for that Union
Cause I know it's Mother Jones' will
Yes I know Mother Jones' will

The children will lay on in these tents
Will lay upon the quilt
The thugs they will ramble through the tents
Pouring kerosene in their milk
Pouring kerosene in their milk

I'm going back to High green mountains
going back to them old green mountain hills
I'm gonna fight for that Union,
cause I know it's Mother Jones' will
yes I know it's Mother Jones' will.
