SPECIAL REPORT ON RUMOR CLINIC OF COLUMBIA, S.C., LIONS CLUB

A "rumor clinic" organized by the Columbia, S.C., Lions Club 
has been doing effective work during the current week. Two rumors which
had been widely circulated and were very disturbing to Columbians were
"spiked" by the clinic in newspaper stories given a good play by both
Columbia daily newspapers.

One rumor which was heard frequently on the streets on Monday,
October 5, dealt with alleged saboteurs at Lexington Air Base, near Columbia.
Several fatal air accidents have occurred recently at the base, and these
evidently inspired the sabotage rumor.

the other rumor nailed by the Lions Club rumor clinic claimed
that Fort Jackson, near Columbia, was to be an all-Negro army post. This
report spread rapidly and was given credence by many citizens because it
was common knowledge that thousands of white troops had left Fort Jackson
recently for other stations. It was profoundly disturbing to white citizens
to be told that only Negro troops would be stationed at Fort Jackson in
future.

The rumor clinic caused these stories to be published in the
Columbia Record and the Columbia State, effectually squelching the disquieting
reports:
