The following were reported by one of the Secretaries in my office
from conversation she held during the evenings:

A business man who by reason of his position contacts a wide variety
of persons reported that a mechanic in a Defense Plant in Cleveland told
him about a radio broadcast which he claimed to have heard Sunday, August
2nd, in which the commentator stated, "The Russians are fighting without
ammunition or equipment."  When questioned about the source of his information
the mechanic could remember neither the name of the commentator
nor the name of the Radio Station carrying the broadcast.[*Cleveland, Ohio  8-7-42 18*]

This same business man said he doubted the validity of such a
statement because of the fact that it would be comparatively simple for
England to transport rifles, hand grenades, and other equipment by plane
to Russia.
