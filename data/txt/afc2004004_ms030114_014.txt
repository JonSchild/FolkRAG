her that she took all his money and he would have been rich
if she hadn't take everything from him.  In the Ragosin tape
Gary talked about making three hundred dollars a week at this
time from playing on the streets and at picnics.
     It seems that Gary was still living in Greenville in
1928, for that is the year Baby Tate arrived in that town
and he said that Gary was there when he arrived.  Assuming
Gary would have left Greenville shortly after he and his wife
split it might be possible to assume they didn't split till 1927
or 1928.  It appears that his first wife may still be alive in
the Greenline section of Greenville.
     Gary probably took to the rode for a while after he
left Greenville.  He had certainly spent time on the rodes.
traveling from town to town, usually playing at parties or
picnics, (Willie Trice says that when he knew Gary in the '30's)
he didn't play in any of the jook joints, which probably wound't
have appreciated his religious music).  Sometimes sitting in
Garys home he would tell stories which related to traveling,
and hitching around (he once even hitched on a freight train).
and there was often a story about a sheriff arresting him for
having a gun (this is the story of a song called traveling round).
Alan Smithline told me that once Gary started to tell him that
he had once gone to jail but that Annie hushed him up, so its
possible but very uncertain that Gary was in a jail for a while.
      Its seems evident that Gary settled in Washington, N.C.
for a while, which is were he is reputed to have become an
ordained minister.  Bruce Bastin located someon who remembered
Gary traveling and playing on a road which was on the direct
route from Washington to Durham.  In Durham a Beth Davis was 
living, whom Bruce BAstin believes to be a relative of Gary's.
