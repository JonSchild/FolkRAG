Gold Rush Material - and Cow Boy Material
Source: The Chisholm Trail by Sam P. Ridings
It was a poor cow outfit that did not have in its equipment at
least one violin or banjo, and a man who could play the same....The
evening meal was no more than over, when from down the line of wagons
the ping of a banjo was wafted forth on the clear night air.  The 
operator of this instrument was seated on a spring-seat removed from
the wagon and placed on the ground by the camp-fire.  He was a man well
along in years and the cook of his outfit.  This man had spent his active
life on the frontier, a large portion of which had been in the mining 
camps of the west. 
Old Tom Moore - or The Days of Forty- nine
You are grazing now on Old Tom Moore,
A relic of by-gone days;
A bummer sure they call me now, 
But what care I for praise;
As I sigh for days of old, 
And thus do I repine,
For the days of old, 
The days of gole,
The days of forty-nine.
There was Lone Star Jacke
Who in a game of draw,
Would go you a handful blind,
Put in a game of death,
He lost his breath,
In the days of forty-nine
In the days of old --etc
He ran against a knife,
In the hands of one Bob Cline;
It was his last lay-out in fine,
So over Jake we held a wake
In the days of old forty- nine,
In the days of old --etc.
