Dear Alan: Put your money into
10 year U. S. Savings Bonds
bought at a discount. The 
Government agrees to take
them back at any time
with accrued interest. I
think also that Republic
Bank stock is a good
investment. Bass has just
got an extra dividend
of $7 a share. I can get
you four shares for your
$200. The present rate of 
dividend will yield you
about 6% payable quarterly.
The stock has a good market.
