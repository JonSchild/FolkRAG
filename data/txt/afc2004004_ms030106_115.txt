Yes, like that you know with your arms stiffed out.  Especially when they
wouldn't be standing.  And of course, if they was dressed up and you tried to
talk to them, they would find the nearest post (when they'd have a lot of
creases in their clothes) or get to the house and they'd
stiffen their arm out and hold it theyself so far away, just far as their
arm would let them, so they wouldn't get any of their clothes soiled.
[*They was very particular about that*] especially
some of them. (That's right,  you've got the right idea with a kind of a broker
up stand.)  Especially some of them would wear overalls -- overall jumpers -
with a high-callss (sic) pair of trousers, maybe costing them 15 or 18 or 20
dollars during those days, and, of course, they wore the best of shoes and not
only shoes.  They was never nobody would wear a Stetson hat.  Those days
myself, I thought I would die unless I had a hat with the emblem in it name
Stetson, and I didn't rest until I got myself a Stetson hat and a pair 
Edwin Clapp shoes.  Of course, there was many of them that didn't wear
ready made shoes at all during those times.  They wore a lot of shoes that
what they call the St. Louis flats and the Chicago flats.  These shoes were made 
with the cork soles on them and no heels and would turn up in the front. A lot of times they would have
different designs in the toes of the shoes, such as gambler designs,
such as, maybe, a club  or a diamond, a heart or a spade.  I have heard
later on that even some of them had made arrangements to have some kind of
electric light bulbs in their shoes with a battery in their pocket and when
they would get around some Jane or something that was kind of simple and
thought they could make her, as they call making [?], why they'd press a butt
on in their pocket and light up the little-bitty bulb in the toe of their 
shoes.  Oh,
