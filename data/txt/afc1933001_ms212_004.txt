Already our first book is planted in
all the best libraries of Europe. Our
publishers are go-getters, remember.
But I fancy your figures for
cleaning up the book are far too
modest. In addition Mrs. Seeger
must be paid. I understand that
Miss [?] estimated that each
correction in music would
cost $2.50.

 As for the "co-editors" I remember 
only that I proposed to give
my part of the new Ballads to
Miss Terrill and Bess. Miss Terrill
does not want her name printed
as co-editor. How would it
do for you and Bess to be the
sole Lomaxes mentioned, including,
certainly, Mrs. Seeger as Music
Editor? Did Bess Brown indicate
that she was expecting this recognition
