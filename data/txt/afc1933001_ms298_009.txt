Adress to the Progressive Education Association
of the District of Columbia, Friday March 8, 1949
on the subject of American Resources in Folk
Music

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
According to the prospective of today's meeting

I am to talk about American music and its resources for the
educational system. The material with which this address
will deal, however, -- folk music, American folk music --
has been said by eminent musicians and teachers of music
[not only] not to exist at all, or if they admitted it did
exist, they insisted that it could scarsely be called
music. I don't know how many people at present share tis
belief but for those who do, in order that this address
may seem to concern itself with something, I suggest that
they substitute the word "something" every time such a
term as music, song, tune, melody, etc., occurs. That
substitution will do well enough because there is a
musical something here in America which all persons interested
in education, progressive or otherwise, and in
resources of American culture, using that term in its
broadest application, that is, meaning anything that
pertains to American life, -- there is a something here
I will be brash enough to say even a musical something
which all such persons have to take into account. This
musical something has been the chief musical and poetic
expression of the vast majority of the American people
since the first settlers came here. It has furnished the 
musical background for their dances, their religious
gatherings, their work, the amusement of their children
