There is a good whiskey & there is
better whiskey - but there never was
bad whiskey.

You're [?]
Truth I canna be [?].
Do you know where drunkards go
Where the whiskey's cheapest &
best [?]
But there is another place where
there's weepin & wailin & nashin
of teeth -

Humph - they can gnash teeth that
have them to gnash.  I have had but
a stump this forty year.

There'll be a day of reckoning for
all of it.
[?] I'll take a day and a half
every minute of it.

Why did ye shout  [?] have on the
Sabbath.
I had a strong dreed [breed] that the beastie
would not sit till Monday
