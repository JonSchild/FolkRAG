Cheyenne

"Don't go away, stay at home if you can,
Stay away form that city, they call it Cheyenne"

But travellers with the lure of the west in their hearts have
been for many years journeying to Cheyenne July Fourth for the Frontier
Day celebration. I first witnessed the three-day celebration in 1910.
As the big daddy of the species, the fame of the Cheyenne show has
spread throughout the west and south until now during each summer and
autumn hundreds and hundreds of towns imitate Cheyenne. A vigourous
Chamber of Commerce even in the smaller towns of the region, always
includes on its annual budget provision for a wild west exhibition.

Bulldogging, riding outlaw horses or Brahaa steers, trick
roping, catching and typing down steers, milking wild cows, all against
time, have become professions. They cowboy has become a showman. He
travels from town to town through the season, his income dependent on
the cash prizes he wins. Daily he risks his life in attempts to split
the seconds finer. Except in dress (and that often a burlesque in
tawdry showiness) he loses all resemblance to a cowboy if he ever were
one, and becomes a mechanical expert. The most dexterous and picturesque
may get to Madison Square Garden, even to London. But he is lost to the 
ranch, and the ranch is glad to lose him.

Out in Texas, near Old Fort Phantom Hill where Robert E. Lee
once lived, are the Swenson Cattle ranches, run by the sons and grandsons
of the Swensons who set them going. These latter day Swensons
have promoted another type of Cowboys' Reunion. Professionals are barred.
