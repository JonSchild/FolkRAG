So Doggone Soon

Sung:
Yes, I got up this mornin' got up so doggone soon,
Well, I got up this mornin' got up so doggone soon.
"Til I couldn' see nothin', honey, but the stars an' moon. 

Spoken:  
When I git up soon in the mawnin', I couldn't lay back down----
It's the custom of the camp to git up at thrre-thirty an' three
o'clock --Ev'ry mornin' when I walk out, I couldn' see nothin' but the stars
an' the moon--- I 'gin' to think about Shreveport, Louisiana---

SunG:
Yes, I got up this mornin' could not lay back down,
Yes, I got up this mornin' an' I could not lay back down, 
Thinkin' 'bout my baby, livin' in Taylor Town.*
Spoken:
I would be thinkin' 'bout my honey in Shreveport. Lou'siana---
better known as the sun gonna shine in my do' some day----

Sung:
Lord, the sun gonna shine in my do' some day, 
Well, the sun gonna shine in my do' some day, 
Goin' back to North Lou'siana, goin' back there to stay. 

Spoken:
I knowd when I leave here, I wasn' comin' back no' mo'----

SunG;
When I leave here walkin' hang crepe on the do',
When I leave here walkin' hang crepe on the do',
I may not be dead, but I ain' comin' back here no mo'.
Spoken:
I thinkin' 'bout I had lots to tell my baby when I git there ---

Sung:
I'm gonna tell my baby when I get back home, 
Gonna tell my sugar when I get back home,
