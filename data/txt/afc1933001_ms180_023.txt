Dear Mr. Lomax:
I'm delighted to hear from you. A couple
of days ago your father wrote me that he would
do an article for us on the Negro singers of
the South, and I hope very much that you will
be interested in doing one too, on whatever appeals
to you most. Our scope is pretty broad.
Our rates are lamentably low. In the last
issue we had articles by Waldo Frank, Sigrid
Undset, Woody Guthrie, etc., and payment for
each piece averaged less than $35. Like most
such periodicals, we operate on a very slim
subsidy, so the financial end of the magazine is
a continual embarrassment for us. However, we
have received splendid co-operation from most of the
writers, who feel that we are doing an important
job, and this heartens us somewhat.
In the meantime, I have sent you the current
issue of the magazine. Perhaps Woody's piece
will suggest something to you, or you may already
have an idea for an article. In any case, I'd
like to hear from you. The deadline for the next
issue is April 10th. Is there any possibility of
seeing your piece before then?
Cordially,
Frank Mlakar

PS. If you know of other writers who you think would
know about Common Ground, I'd be very glad to have
their names and addresses. We'd like to make a big
thing of this series of articles.
