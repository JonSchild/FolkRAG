Mr. Alan Lomax

Dear Sir:
A letter from you to Miss Wyman and one from Mr.
William Arms Fisher, have just reached me up here.
I am
very sorry that I can not give you much help. The last
I knew, Miss Wyman (Mrs. H.M. Paynter) was lying seriously
ill in the Doctor's Hospital in New York City.
My recommendation to you is to go to the Pine
Mountain Settlement School, Pine Mountain, Harlan County,
where you will be able to obtain information about singers
and everything concerning folk-songs in the mountains.
From my experience, in 1916, I would certainly say that
Harlan and Knott Counties would be the richest in material 
for your search.
Wishing you every success and regretting
that I can not help you more satisfactorily,
believe me to be,
Sincerely yours,
Howard Brockway
