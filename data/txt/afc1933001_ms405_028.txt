MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS 
Late one night I stopped at Sweetwater, Texas. I could find only 
one vacant hotel room. 
"I can rent you only half of the bed," the proprietor told me. 
"a midnight train may bring other guests. I've go to take care of 
them." 
About two o'clock in the morning a lank, roughly dressed stranger 
came into the room. He carried no luggage. After undressing slowly 
he turned off the light. As he stretched himself out beside me (neither 
of us had spoken a word), he said, "Well, partner, its been a long 
time since we slept together, ain't it? When I woke up the next morn- 
ning he was gone. 



Out on the Spur  anch at the foot of the North Plains in Texas, 
a visiting cowboy reached the ranch long after midnight. The rising 
bell, hanging on a pole outside his window, sounded its warning at 
five o'clock the next morning. The cowboy knew the penalty for not 
promptly rolling out of bed; no coffee, no breakfast of any sort. A
few minutes later some of the men found the visitor leaning against 
the dining room smoking a preliminary cigarette. As they passed the 
sleepy cowboy grumbled: "This the shortest time I ever stayed all 
night in my life."
