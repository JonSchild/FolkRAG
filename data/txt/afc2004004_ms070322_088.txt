on the road. Across the rolling moors,
buff with purple black green
square copses scattered curiously
across hills that seemed to
have died a 100+ years past.
The hills near homestead like
combers on the sea & the grey
threads of farm walls sewing 
them together like seaweed
in a milky grass ocean.

All the walls & all the
houses hereabouts were built
out of stones from Hadrian's 
Wall built by & under 1 roman
legion (10,000) men between
120 & 126 A.D. 16 ft high 
7 1/2 ft wide - turets 4 feet
higher facing the barbarians
north for 70 miles between
Newcastle & Carlisle. And
where it hasn't been torn
