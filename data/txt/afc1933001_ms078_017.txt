Dear Barrett:

    This past fall, H. W. Luce who is a big boy in TIME, LIFE,
and FORTUNE group was in Texas and sought me out. I put on a
show with the Negro, Leadbelly, on the second March of Time. His
outfit attended and I was surprised to find that he remembered all
about me. Please tell Barbara that I'm willing to got the limit in
her behalf if she should feel that any word of mine might help her
progress in the TIME organization. I know two other large stock
holders in that bunch, one of them being an active editor. I don't
think I've ever told you that my master Saturday Evening Post sales-
man whose record had something to do with Lee Higginson's interest
in me, has been very successful while still under thirty and is prac-
tically independent. Just now he is playing the oil game in Texas
spending other peoples money while his is soundly invested. My
youngest daughter, Bess Brown Lomax, is a senior student at Bryn Mawr
College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., and Alan, as you know, writes the
script for a program of Columbia Broadcasting System, called Back
Where I Come From, three times weekly and in addition sings and
arranges a folk song program on the American School of Air once
every two weeks. At the same time, he is holding a steady job in the
Library of Congress as Assistant in Charge of the American Archive
of Folk Song. I think he really works as hard and intensely as you
used to do when I was able to see so little of you.

    With sincerest regards, I am,
    Your friend,
    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Curator and Consultant
    Archive of American Folk Song
    Library of Congress
