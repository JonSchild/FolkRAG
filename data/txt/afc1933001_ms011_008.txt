Dr. Leicester B. Holland
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.
Dear Dr. Holland:
The enclosed letter to Dr. Putnam will 
tell you of the grant made by our Executive Committee
on Tuesday. Will you please give it to him, making
any necessary explanations?
President Newcomb of the University of 
Virginia has asked for $2500 more for the pictures
of colonial architecture in Virginia, of which he 
says $1500 is needed for the the making of additional 
negatives, and $1,000 for prints to the University,
which will be put on permanent exhibition there.
Dr. Leland tells us that Mr. Lomax is 
honorary curator of your Archive of Folk-Song, so it
seems quite appropriate to make the Library of Congress
sponsor for a grant in his behalf.
Sincerely yours,
F. P Kepper
