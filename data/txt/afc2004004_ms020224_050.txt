     An' I went up to this place, between, ah, ah, Pirise an'
ah, Gooze (??).  He's stayin' out there.  An', ah, had a 
lil' shop.  An' I looked at his face; stood there an' looked at 
'im.  Say, "I didn't thnk I'd ever see you -- would ever leave
home."
     He said, "I know you somewhere."  He didn't know
who I was, you know.  I was kinda small the last he seen me.
     Then I made 'im know who I was.  I asked him about Mary, his
wife.  Mary was dead.  An' he -- I said, "Well, how'd you get
here?"
     He said, "I just walked out."
     I said, "Well, you ever get out a debt?"
     He said, "No."  For 21 years he was workin' right there
with Marion (?) Dickson an' ah, he say he never -- he say every
year he's in debt.  Said he walked out.  He say he went an' tol'
him that, that, that, ah that year, say he just tired a bein'
in debt all the time.  Say, "How much I owe ya?"
     Say, "Ya ya owe much now; ya jus' owe me $300."
     Said, "Okay."
     Three hundred dollars, ya only payin' a dollar a day at
75 cents a day, if you gonna work by the day, you know you're gettin'
somewhere.
     An' so, ah, he jus' walked out.  Every year, it'd be from one
thing to the other.  So he just got tired.
     I say, "You better not come back; better not send back."
     He say, "They ain't; they ain't bother."
     Jus' a-man of 'em left, just that way.  The farmer got, got clean.
Some of 'em would, would get outa debt an' the don' know it,
