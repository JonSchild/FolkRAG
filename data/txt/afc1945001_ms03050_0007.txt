On August 7, a young woman shopper was heard telling two other 
young women that a relative of hers employed at Fort Jackson had seen
fresh bread and "perfectly good meats" being thrown away on many occasions
when "he would have been very glad to take the food home for the family."
The young women to whom this statement was made said that they had heard 
similar reports and that it was disgraceful for "the army to be wasting 
food" when many civilians were "doing without" because food prices were
so high in Columbia. 

6. On Thursday, August 6, a young woman was heard to state that
motorists who really wanted more gasoline and who "knew the ropes" could
easily obtain it in Columbia. She said an acquaintance of hers had just 
procured a tankful of gasoline without presenting his rationing card and 
that this acquaintance could "do the same thing for other people who 
wanted more gasoline."

Substantially the same remark was heard Friday, August 7, at a 
service station in Columbia where a man was waiting to be served. This
man, a middle-aged man dressed in over-alls and apparently from the rural 
areas, said that a friend of his "was able to get all the gasoline he 
wants, while I am waiting here to get just four gallons." He added, 
"I'm going to see this friend of mine tonight and get him to put me in 
touch with this fellow that has plenty of gasoline to sell."
