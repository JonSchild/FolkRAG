Kind Hearted Woman Blues, Johns or,
Robert Johnson, Perfect 7 - 03 - 56(SA 2580)

I got a kindhearted woman, [?]
[?] anything in this world for me,
But these evil hartted [all the] women and they will not let me be.

I love my baby, my baby don't love me,
I love my baby, co----, my baby don't love me,
I really love that woman, can't stand to leave her be.

Ain't but the one thing,
Mkes mister Johnson drink,
I just worry 'bout how you treat me, baby,
[And] I begin to think,
Oh, babe, my life don't feel the same,
You break my heart,
When you call mister so-and-so's name.

[You] 
She's a kind hearted woman, she studies evil all the time,
You well as to kill me as to have it on yo' min'.
