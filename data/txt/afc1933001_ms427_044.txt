O, NO, JOHN

O n yonder hill there stands a creature,
Who she is I do not know;
I'll go ask her hand in marriage,
She must answer yes or no.

Chorus: O, no, John, no,
John, no, John, no!

My father was a Spanish captain,
Went to sea a month ago;
First he kissed me, then he left me,
Bid me always answer no.

Chorus:

O Madam, in your face is beauty,
On your lips red roses grow;
Will you take me for your husband?
Madam, answer yes or no.

Chorus:

O Madam, since you are so cruel,
And that you do scorn me so,
If I may not be your husband?
Madam, will you let me go?

Chorus:

O hark! I hear the church-bells ringing,
Will you come and be my wife?
O r, dear Madam, have you settle
To live single all your life?

Chorus:

THE MINSTREL BOY

The minstrel boy to the war has gone,
In the ranks of death you'll find him.
His father's sword he has girded on,
And his wild harp slung behind him.

"Land of song" said the warrior-bard,
"Tho' all the world betrays thee,
O ne sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,
One faithful harp shall praise thee."

The minstrel fell! but the foeman's chain
Could not bring his proud soul under.
The harp he loved never spoke again,
For he tore its chords asunder,

And said "No chains shall sully thee,
Thou soul of love and bravery,
Thy songs were made for the pure and free,
They shall never sound in slavery."
