You take a glass
A mirror with a cover
Poud' ta ule' - from drugstore
You put this in the mirror [glass], you put this on
the edge of a hole where a snake lives, the
snake comes & looks at himself, he's made,
he dies in agony (thinking its another snake,
li [be] goum√© laitre, you hide & watch (if
he sees you he chokes you to death)
you take the glass, close it, put it
in your pocket for seven days never moving
it -
If you're in love with a girl, you go
& talk to her, you open the mirror &
the girl looks into it, you close the mirror
- everywhere you go, she follows you
calling you everywhere you go
