And spiked His feet, and spiked His feet; 
They nailed His hands and spiked His feet.
My Savior never uttered a murmuring word, 
No not a word, no not a word.

The sound was heard in Jerusalem streets, 
In Jerusalem streets, in Jerusalem streets; 
The sound was hear in Jerusalem streets. 
My Savior never uttered a murmuring word, 
No not a word, no not a word. 

7 

He suffered this all for you and me, 
For you and me, for you and me; 
He suffered this all for  you and me. 
My Savior never uttered a murmuring word, 
No not a word, no not a word.

No. 8     Moving Up Home Some Day 

Key of F 

On earth I'm a pilgrim and stranger, 
No place to abide for aye; 
But I have a home in God's heaven,
I'm moving up home some day. 

CHORUS 

I'm moving up home some day, 
I'm moving up home some day; 
I'm going away to heaven to stay,
I'm moving up home some day. 

2 

My deeds are all signed and recorded,
