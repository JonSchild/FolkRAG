Sung:
Gonna tell my baby when I get back home,
I'm goin' tell my baby when I git back home,
Lord, I been down yonder where de lights burn all night long.

Spoekn:
I dream 'bout Shreveport, Lou'siana on Texas Avenue----
Sung:
I'm gonna write me a letter, one thing I want her to do,

Ain' but the one thing, Marthy, I want you to do,
Hon, I want you to meet me on Texas Avenue.
If you git there, Marthy, good while before I do,
If you get there, Marthy while before I do,
Want you to tell ev'rybody, hon', I'm comin' too.
