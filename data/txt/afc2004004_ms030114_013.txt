As a child, Gary was probably left alone by other kids, 
because he was blind. By himself Gary raised chickens and
said he knew them all by name. It should be noted, that Gary
was not totally blind, but could distinguish the presence of
shapes, though of course not very well. He was remarkable, in

It was while living in Green ville that Gary's first marriage
 broke off. His wife went off with Joe Walker (Willie's
