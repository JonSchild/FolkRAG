Dean Briggs- John A. Lomax
March 1942

I came to Harvard in 1906. Dean Briggs admitted me to English 5, where
I used to sit in mute wonder an envy as he read the brilliantly written themes
of Edward Sheldon and Van Wyck Brooks, two undergraduate members of the class.
When the Dean ocasionally invited me to his week-end rretreat at Halfway Pond,
he would take a handbag containing fifty pounds or more of themes from
ordinary stick-in-the-mud students. He told me that often he read a theme three
or four times before he could decide on a just "mark". Looking at his seamed and
tired face, I sometimes begged him to let me help, or, better to dump the entire mass
into the deepest part of Halfway Pond.

I shall never be able to understand why Dean Briggs looked at me twice.
I was only one nondescript far-below-average student from Texas. Perhaps it was 
our mutual love for horses. In Cambridge now and then I rode behind one of his
high-stepping thoroughbreds; down at Halfway Pond, where he kept several pampered
long-legged bays, he and I amazed the natives from Plymouth to Buzzard Bay by our
feaths of [?unorothodox] horsemanship. As I recall, I taught him only one thing: how to tie a loop
in a rope and then to throw the rope so that the loop would spread and settle around
the neck of a fleeing animal.

One day in the late Spring of 1907, while I was preparing for the June
final examinations, I fell violently ill. I woke up one morning in Stillman Infir-
mary, not knowing how I got there. During my first conscious moment, I saw the kind
face of Dean Briggs (there never was and never will be another face like it.)
Morning after morning there he was, sometimes distressing me because he seemed
apologetic for his intrusion: Then, as substitutes, came other teachers. "Briggs told
me", said each one, Fred Robinson and Barrett Wendell and finally Jove himself.
