July 2, 1964

Dear Alan:

   In Answer to your recent letter, we are enclosing
copies of the lists that accompanied the three tape collections
from Arthur S. Alberts.

   Concerning Henrietta Yurchenko's Guatemala recordings,
there are seven 12" 78 rpm discs of 32 songs from the Ixil
group, and twenty three 12" 78 rpm discs of 111 songs from the
Quiche group.  Discounting blank sides, there is a total of
143 songs on 53 sides.

   It is impossible to predict the actual playing time
of these songs, but it is unlikely that it would exceed four
hours.  Using this maximum time figure, four 7" double track
reels of tape at 7.5 ips, plus a similar quantity for our own
reference collections, would amount to $137.80, including postage
and handling.  Using 10# double track reels at 7.5 ips, the
total cost would be $136.90, including postage and handling.
The use of single track tape and/or 15 ips speed would increase
these figures.

   Our recording engineers inform us that the Yurchenko
discs are in relatively good condition, and that written permission
would of course be necessary from Miss Yurchenko before
they could proceed with any duplication.

With all best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Joseph C. Hickerson
