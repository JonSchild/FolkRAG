forgive my seeming lack of good manners towards you; and
we can continue to correspond for the time being.  I know
you must be very busy and I appreciate the interest you
have generously shown in me and would be willing if I
can ever do you a favour in return.  I will probably be
leaving again in the near future when I know my
mother cannot relapse.  But if you care to write again, if
you have time I will be pleased to hear of your work in 
the Folk Song world.  Are you still in London? or are you on
tour? And could you tell me which make of Finger-style 
guitar do you consider is the best in tone and otherwise.  I 
know the reputation of the PANORMO and JULVE etc but their
price is at present beyond.  The instrument you were
useing in BALLADS & BLUES was what I have always
had in mind but can never seem to find that tone.
I bought a Grimshaw Plectrum Electracoustic guitar for
what dance work I do and it lowered my funds to danger
point.  However I am again building a comfortable reserve and
if you could give me the approximate price of the one you
reccommend I would have a fair idea then of how I would
stand or how long I would have to wait before I continue
with my Folk Air collecting.  I will remain grateful for
this information as I cannot come by it here in N. Ireland.
Yours Sincerely
Gerard Campbell.
