Freedom 

Sometimes we sit and wonder, 
While looking at the sky.
We wonder what's beyond it,
and if God is watching on high. 
We wonder if he's watching, 
Our Johnny who's gone across
Across the blue Pacific, 
Where many lives are lost. 

And then it makes us angry, 
To think all all fools. 
Who are always making fusses, 
From lack of valuable fuels. 
They just don't seem to realize
The fight we're going through, 
They gossip, and hiss, and cry, and lie 
About such little things.

If they would start to think 
About the agony of some join 
souls.
Who pray day and night, and 
sacrifice
So our flag can fly high
