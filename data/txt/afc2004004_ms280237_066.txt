Lomax: Tell the story of that, Harry.
Cox: Well, that was all true, the bab, an' he hired the broad
an' he didn't like people to go on it; they would go. They can't
keep 'em off.
Lomax: What was babbing?
Cox: Babbin'? Takin' eels out of the water on a pole without
hooks. Works, threaded on wool.
Lomax: Mashing worms on. . .
Cox: You string 'em on, you have a wire, get  - pick these
here, an' run it right through 'em, thread 'em all on a 
long string, an' then you take 'em, turn 'em round your fingers
like that. Make a bunch, tie a string on it, and then you drop
'em into the water, an' they hang on be the teeth. You lift 'em
over the boat and they leave go an' drop in, an' then in you go
again. They drop off as soon as you lift 'em up. There's no
hooks.
Lomax: It goes very fast, you catch a lot of them?
Cox: You've got to be - you got to draw 'em up when they bite,
you know. Oh, I have been - got two stone in a half an hour
sometimes. It's quick work when they bite. He - o' course that
old fellow, he hired the an' he tried to keep them off,
and they would go, and that's what happened to him. He couldn't
do anything in it. An' they made up the song, an' my father
went carryin'. . .they carried around Barton, with a eel hanging
on a string, on their shoulders, little boy, an' singin' the
song.                                                        They tried to
annoy him all they could an' that's how they done it.
