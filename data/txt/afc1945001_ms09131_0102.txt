Senior, white, Female

An armless man was passed by his draft board and inducted into the army.
His constant protests to this commanding officers - that he was unfit for
military duty were ignored and he was told that since he was passed by his
draft board he was useful someplace in the army. Came the day for special
assignments - and in reply to his protest that he couldn't do anything
the sergeant said -
"Do you see that pump over there?"
"Yes," said the private.
"Well," said the sergeant, "there is a blind man over
there pumping water, you stand over there and
tell him when the bucket is full."
