A man in reaching under his bed for his
lb. coffee knocked over his can of gasoline which
spilled all over his 500 lbs of sugar. He
said to himself, "Well I'am certainly glad.
I put by raisins, plums, and beans in 
the closet instead of under the bed. You
wouldn't call him a hoarder would you?

A lady told her husband: "What ever
we have for dinner, don't be surprised." He 
said why? She said: because the pipe broken
and the basement flooded washing off
all of the labels from the cans and I
never know what I am opening.

Two soldiers were talking. One said "a
soldier walked up to the top sargeant knoked
him down, stomped him, run over him with
a tank, clubed him and. The other soldier
(who was very excited by this time) said
yes, yes, what else? The other one replied: I
don't know I woke up.
