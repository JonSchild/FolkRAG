Dear Mr. Saron:

After you called I spoke to Peter Seeger
and Laurence Gellert in regard to the folk music
program we discussed. Gellert knows Negro singers
in Harlam and  that should round out our program
completely. I suggest that you give Mr. Seeger and
Mr. Gellert full leaway in planning the program until
I return on the second of January. Then we can all
get together. 

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
