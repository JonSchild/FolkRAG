Dear Mr. Putnam:

Sometime ago, you wr[o]te me that some Radio Artist had spoken
to Mr. Brett about securing my invaluable services as fellow traveller.
You may pass the word on that I am always interested in any
suggestion that might lead me to earn an honest dollar.

Sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax
