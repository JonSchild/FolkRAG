Lullabys 
Hush little Baby don't you cry 

Work Songs 
Working on the Levee 

Of the favourite songs of the older generation nearly twenty-nine 
per cent were popular songs (songs definitely other than church or 
religious songs); thirty-two per cent, hymns; twenty-two per cent, 
spirituals (together fifty-four per cent); fourteen per cent, blues; 
and two per cent lullabys and work songs. In contrast to this the 
younger generation listed more than twice the number of blues as given 
by the older generation. Thirty per cent as favourites, and thirty-
eight per cent popular songs; eight per cent, hymns; twenty-two per 
cent, spirituals; and two per cent work songs. This is illustrated in 
the following listing:
