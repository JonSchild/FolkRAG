scattered stanzas with his interpolations so that they form a narrative or
semi-ballad. 
His interpolations are not spoken, but chanted
to the accompaniment of the dominant chord of the song he happens to be singing. The tone is a singing tone and the sentences are
fitted to the beat of the music,
with their poetic repetitions
so that/they sound more like verse than prose. 
About the origin of this technique
one can only make the vaguest conjectures. No other Negro we have heard sing did more than exclaim or shout out suddenly in between the verses of his songs. Perhaps Lead Belly is imitating the manner of
the ordinary country preacher who chants, sometimes almost
sings, his sermon when he is deeply moved. Or perhaps he caught a smattering
of his technique from the comic
singers of the 1st century who sometimes inserted a line of patter
between stanzas. Be the inspiration what it may, Lead belly has
practiced this "talking" technique ever since he began to play
the guitar, until it at last produced the magnificent "Frankie and Albert" - the crown of this book.*

*We rather suspect that Lead Belly, since he noticed that we enjoyed it so much, did more talking while he was with us than he had ever done before.
