College.  Freshman  Negro.  Female.

1. A negro received a communication stating that he was to appear before his local draft board on a certain day.  When the negro appeared before the board, the person in charge asked the negro his name and address.  The negro became incensed and said "Now look, don't be funny with me. You sent for me, you knew my name and address then, why don't you know it now.  I am not going to tell you anything." Much persuading could not force the negro to give any information. Finally the clerk said, "N- you go back to the country where you came from. We don't need fools like you in the army."
2. We had better win this war because if Hitler does, it will be too bad.
