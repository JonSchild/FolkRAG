Intro.

1.  Sen-or- es es-chu-chen la his- tor-ia mas triste de un
   pueblo en-gan-a- do por su ca- pa-taz, quien fiel a los pul-pos de su a-amo ex-tran-jer-o le
   niega a los su-yos su her- en-cia miner- al Y (mientras etc.) (a)-legre, can-ta a-si.  Puer-
   to Ri-co tie-ne min-as Puerto Ri-co tie-ne min-as; De hiero co- bre y u- ran-io tie-ne
   mi-nas de verdad; Pe- ro si el pueblo se duerme perde- ra sus ri-cas mi-nas; Re -
   cuerda Puer-torriqueno, que nos las quieren qui-tar. (To v. 3) las quier- en qui-tar. 

2.  Y mientras el pueblo vivia ignorante
   de sus yacimientos el Eme Pe I (MPI)
   por valles y montes al pueblo alertaba
   y hoy todo Borinquen alegre, canta asi: (Cho)

3.  Despierta, boricua; defiende lo tuyo;
   pongamosle coto a la explotacion; 
   unamos todos a quien nos defiende 
   por bien de Borinquen y un futuro major. (Cho)

BACKGROUND and TRANSLATION:  The author of the song
above, J. A. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, is a Puerto Rican and 
a supporter of the Puerto Rico Independence Move- 
ment -- MPI.  He writes: "In 1964 the MPI discover- 
ed and made public a secret government study regard- 
ing the discovery a few years before of very rich 
mineral deposits in Puerto Rico.  The large deposits 
are of copper, followed by iron, silver, gold and 
even uranium.  While the people were kept ignorant 
of this wealth two American monopolies -- referred 
to in Puerto Rico as 'octupuses' -- were informed 
about it.  They secretly began to buy up the land 
at cheap prices, aided by 'pitiyanquis' -- petty 
yankee or little yankee, native quislings.  The MPI
started an intensive educational campaign among the 
peasants in the copper region.  Thanks to our cam-
paign the people of Puerto Rico are now aware of 
the existence of their mineral treasure and of 
the U. S. attempt to exploit it.  In fact, the Leg-
islature of Puerto Rico felt compelled to start an 
'investigation' to keep the scandal from spreading. 
In my songs we ask the people to defend what be-
longs to us: our mineral wealth.  Since it is 
practically impossible to translate verse to be 
sung into verse to be sung, I preferred to make a 
prose translation of SONG OF THE MINES.

Here is the prose translation of SONG OF THE MINES:

Ladies and gentlemen, listen to the saddest 
story of a country deceived by its foreman who, 
true to the octupuses of his foreign master, 
denies his own people their minderal inheritance.

And while the people lived in ignorance of their 
mineral deposits the MPI (travelling) through 
mountains and vallies, put the people on guard, 
and now all of Borinquen sings happily thus 
(the following song):

Puerto Rico has mines, Puerto Rico has mines; it 
truly has iron, copper, and uranium mines; but if 
the people go to sleep, they will lose their mines; 
remember, Puerto Rico, that they (the invaders) 
wish to deprive us of them.

Wake up, Puerto Rico (boricua); defend what be-
longs to you; let us put a stop to exploitation; 
let's all join those who defend us for the good of 
Borinquen and for a better future.

Note:  The traditional and poetic name of Puerto Rico 
is BORINQUEN; and Puerto Rican, BORICUA.  And the Gov-
ernor, being a colonial governor, is considered to be 
nothing but a "foreman" for the American monopolies.")
