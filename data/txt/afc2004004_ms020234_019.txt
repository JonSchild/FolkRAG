that."  I ain' got nothin' to do with that part. I don't try
to boss 'em at all.  But what I can do.   I, I go buy 'em what I 
wanna buy 'em an' I give 'em what I wanna give 'em.  An' if they
sick, I can tell them -- if they ain't did it -- what to do.   See?
TL:        Do you think that's the hardest thing that you've ever had
to do in your life?
BJ:        Whatch you mean?
TL:        Give up that responsibility.
BJ:        Unnn...Well, I guess so.  'Bout, 'bout the on'iest hurtin' in
min', ya know.  You know, in thoughts, in mind an' thoughts.
TL:         Do you think it hurts you more than some of the other...
BJ:        Well, I never, I never had anything else on my mind, you

mean I miss, stuff like that.   Then I just buy things for anybody's 
child, see.  Just give it to 'im.  I like to do that. Hah...!
TL:        Do you think you miss children more than you miss men?
BJ:        Oh, God, yeah!  Oh, oh, yeah, Jesus!  Man's grown; he can
tend to hisself.   I miss chilren sumpin' that, you know, need
help an' need the trainin' an' need teachin'. I...I miss them;
I don' miss no man. 'Lessen it's somebody sick or somebody he'pless
