Dear Friend,

Now that the people of the United States have come to understand
and to enjoy native American folk music, it is extremely important
for them to hear more and more authentic country singing. In
my opinion, genuine country folk singers, born and bred to their
tradition, are very much like serious concert artists or composers
in the field of fine art music. In order to receive recognition
in their own regions, they must be masters of a complex
and subtle style.

Thus Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Aunt Molly Jackson and Jean Ritchie
have made permanent and unique contributions to the solid growth
of American music. My purpose in writing you is to introduce a
new singer, whom I believe can take her place with these artists.
Her name is Bessie Jones. She was born and reared in the red
hills of northeast Georgia, where she learned a magnificent repertoire
of songs from her grandparents. These songs date back a
century or more and are the master type from which Negro folk
music grew. Mrs. Jones has been a leading performer with the
Spiritual Singers of the Georgia Sea Islands for some time and
knows this tradition of ante bellum shouts and work songs, as well.
Not only does she have the most interesting collection of any
Negro informant I have ever found, but she also knows scores of
dances and of folk tales.

We have worked together for some time and she is now prepared to
present her material to any audience in a weave of melody and
anecdote that presents a stirring and memorable picture of the
way Negro folkways have grown. She is a fine speaker. She has a
big, powerful and thrilling voice, and she is a person of tremendous
dignity and charm.

I cannot urge you too strongly to invite Mrs. Jones to tell her
story and sing her songs to your folk song audience. For the
moment I am acting as her friend in arranging concerts and appearances
for her because I feel strongly that the root stuff of
Negro folk music is still unknown to most Americans. It is perhaps
our greatest tradition, and Bessie Jones is fully capable of
presenting it. Please let me know if you are interested and on
what terms.

Yours Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
