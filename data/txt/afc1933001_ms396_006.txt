driven under the lash until they fell from exhaustion; many,according to rumor,dying
from sunstroke amid the sun-baked rows of corn and cane in "dem long,hot summer days."
The songs pictures what went on in the minds of a gang of field-woekers, one of whom
was about to be punished.
The Negroes see the "Cap'n" riding up on his horse with a bull whip in one
hand and a cowhide in the other.  They work faster.  "Better go to drivin'", says the
song.  After each excited ejaculation, the chorus rings out,  "Great Godamighty!"
Ridin' in a hurry.  Great Godamighty!
Ridin' like he's angry. Great Godamighty!
Well,I wonder what's de matter?  Great Godamighty!
Bull whip in one hand. Grett Godamighty!
Cowhide in de udder. Great Godamighty!
Gonna be trouble, Great Godamighty!
Well de Cap'n went to talkin', Great Godamighty!
"well,come here an' hold him." Great Godamighty!
"Bully,low down yo' britches." Great Godamighty!
"Cap'n,let me off, suh!" Great Godamighty!
"Won't you 'low me a chance,suh?" Gre?t Godamighty!
De bully went to pleadin', Great Godamighty!
De bully went to hollerin', Great Godamighty!
De whup went to poppin', Great Godamighty!
     The listeners in the room grew tense as the four strong voices blended in the
terrible sweep of the song.  Again the stolid guard whispered to me:  "The goose pimples
always come out along my spine when I hear niggers sing that song."  Even outside in the
adjacent iron-barred dormitory the chatter and clamor of two hundred black convicts
became stilled into awed and reminiscent silence as the song swept on,growing in power
to the end,while Lightnin', blue-black,vivid,poised as if for flight,leaned forward and
sang with his three comrades,
"Great Godamighty!"
