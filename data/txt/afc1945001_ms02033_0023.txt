RUMORS ON RATIONING
1.. There is plenty of gas, rubber, and sugar; rationing is just a lot 
of nonsense.
2.. Soap will be the next rationed item, and needlessly so.
3.. The government will confiscate the tires of private autos in a few 
months.
4.. Most of the gas dealers in this state refuse to punch the cards of old customers.
5.. The lifting of ceiling prices on canned goods by the OPA means price 
control will be a joke and profiteering will develop.
6.. Gas rationing is to be limited to two gallons per coupon.
7.. Since the true objective of gas rationing is the conservation of rubber, 
it is grossly unfair to restrict New England and not the rest of the country.
8.. The increased wage demands of labor will ruin the ceiling price setup.
9.. Sugar rationing is unnecessary.
10.. Rubber salvage is being used by junk dealers to great advantage since they are hoarding the rubber for higher prices.
11.. There are plenty of tires on the black market.
12.. The aluminum drive was unnecessary and the aluminum collected has not 
yet been used. Hence the present rubber drive is not meeting with success.

ANTI-RUSSIAN RUMORS
1.. We shall have to fight Russia after we lick Hitler.
2.. Russia will surrender and join the axis if a second front is not opened. 
3.. Russia can take all the axis can give her, so why worry.
4.. Russia may sell us out.
5.. As many as 50 ships in a single convoy have been sunk on their way to 
Russia.
6.. Russia is negotiating a separate peace and will thus turn over to the axis 
all the supplies we are sending her.
7.. Russia will negotiate a separate peace and leave us in the lurch.
