Report on Preliminary Work in Clarksdale, Mississippi,

Coahoma County had undergone a change in the week which elapsed between the scouting trip with Mr. Work, Mr. Lomax and Mr. Ross.  Where everything had been casual and slow paced before, now there was humming activity.  The streets in the Negro business district were empty except for the occasional person on some errand.

At the end of the week the wages for cotton pickers had advanced to $2.00 a hundred.  Not since 1926 had the wages reached that level.  Everybody was in the fields.

The usual wages for servants were from three to four dollars a week.

A cook said that she had been working for four dollars a week and in one week of cotton picking she had earned $15.00.  A man who worked in a pool room related a conversation between himself and his employer in which he told the employer that his hours of work would have to be reduced and his wages increased from eight to ten dollars a week if he wanted him to come back to work.  The employer was reported as saying that, "I'll rack balls myself before I'll pay you $10.00."  To which the Negro replied "Well, it looks like you gonna rack 'em.  There's too much cotton in Coahoma County for me to work for eight dollars a week."  I inquired
