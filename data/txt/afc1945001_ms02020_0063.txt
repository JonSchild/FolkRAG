report Written August 8, 1942
Southern California

In considering rumors in Southern California, it should
be borne in mind that the state was primarily of isolationist view
point before the war and this view point has not been changed as
far as consideration of post-war participation in world affairs.
There is no lack of loyalty to the United States, and people are
anxious to win the war, but they are not as concerned with Hitler
as they are with Japan. Consequently, stories and rumors are in
circulation concerning the Japanese while little interest is shown
in England and the British Empire.

SUBJECT: CURRENT RUMORS IN METROPOLITAN LOS ANGELES
A University of Southern California student heard, on
August 3, 1942, a story that, "the American Navy is convoying a
boat load of rubber heels to England to be put on the shoes of the
English soldiers so they can retreat more easily."
Another story is that the Government is confident the
war will be over within a year as proven by the "fact" that the
Federal Government would not enter into a contract of not more
than one year in duration, and that it is cancelling contracts
that have previously been awarded for a year or two in advance.
This letter story was noted August 4, 1942 by a University student
who overheard a conversation on a local street car.
A shipyard worker commented that there were many Anti-British
stories going around Los Angeles Shipyards. For example
it is said, "We have to do all the fighting." "The Limeys are
yellow, etc." This was told Wednesday, August 5, 1942.
