Tape:  1356 cont.  Mrs. Dennis mcGee   5

AL:     So you replenished the earth, but it was hard work.
Mrs. McGee:     Yeah, somebody said this week, I don't remember
who, she said, do you think you're going to [og] go to heaven.
I said I'm sure I am, because God knows all what I went through
and I'm in his presence.   One day I'm gonna meet him and see
my two children, in Heaven.   They were angels, one was 5 years
old, the other, the little boy was 11 months, and I know they 
are angels in heaven. . . .

AL:     (to Dennis)  What does Mardi Gras mean anyway?
Dennis:    When Christ was under the ground, they all put a 
[mat under the base] mask on their face to catch Jesus, the Jew .   That's whay
they put it on Mardi Gras, they use the same habits.   People
put them masks on their face, and run around all over the
country, and they beg for chicken or something, for gumbo.
That's where Mardi Gras comes from, when Jesus. . . [.was} on the Earth
blindfolded and [the people]  , , , ,they catch Jesus to kill him.
That's what Mardi Gras is for, old time. . .
Mrs. McG:      I didn't know it was like that, you sure it's like
that?
AL:      And what do the two words mean?
Dennis:      Mardi Gras is the two boys you can eat anything.  That
what the words mean.  Mardi Gras means fat, you can eat anything
that day, . . . Mardi, that's Tuesday.
Mrs. McG::     After the feast, you fast.  Seven weeks without
eating meat. . . . . . .When Mardi Gras. . . . . . .
