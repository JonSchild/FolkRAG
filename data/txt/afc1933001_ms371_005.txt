"as essentially as do the dry arroyos and washes along which he skulks."  That
Don Coyote has impressed himself on travelers and writers is borne out by the
fact that Miss Barclay's bibliography contains 262 items.

The Indians named the Coyote, and the animal is found nowhere else.  He is
pue American.  The Wichita Falls High School Football Coyotes have chosen this name
wisely.  They have a right to be proud of their name, even though no man likes to be
called a coyote.

But, as Miss Barclay points out, the coyote shows good judgment in running
away.  All the time he is planning to come back if he leaves food behind.  "He excels
all his rivals in cunning and intelligence.  His business is to find and get his dai-

and the fur-bearing animals, the coyote has spread over the country from the West.
Now the Eastern States are asking for bounties to help exterminate him.

In Indian myth the coyote was sometimes divine, sometimes the Great Spirit's
first Lieutenant.  As the latter he first makes the world a fit place to live in;
then restores it after the great flood.  He invents fire, he invokes death and then
sheds the first tears when his son becomes a victim.  In countless Indian legends
his clever resourcefulness is rewarded by leadership in the affairs of the universe.
He was before man.  He even set out the qualities of man.  he should be given the best
points of all the animals, as a fianl touch he craftiness and the cunning of the c
coyote.

There's alot more about Don Coyote in the volume, Coyote Wisdom, than Miss
Barclay's excellent essay, abridged.  Dan Storm has some sympathetic and artistic
pictures in "the Little Animals of Mexico."  There are Pueblo Indian variations of
Old World tales, attractively presented by Miss Elizabeth Willis DeHuff, who also adds
a chapter of Navajo Creation Myths.  The latter half of the volume is a miscellany
