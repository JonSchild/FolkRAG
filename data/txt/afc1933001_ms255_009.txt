Sugar cane

I'm planting cane
when you plant daat
on dat bull-tongue waggon
Ole massa's walkin roun
An' de midnight dew is fallin
on de ole sugar cane
on de ole cane farm
An' you scrapin sugar cane
An' de cane is growin high
Cho on de ole cane farm
an' the grass is [overtakin] it
You better "high" some old darkie
an' dat grass growin' by
Where we get molasses from
on dat ole sugar farm
