JOAN AND BETTY RAYNER - TROUBADOURS

Dear Mr. Lomax,

     As we thought things over on the drive to
Baltimore, we both began to feel very sorry that you 
had put our name to the Australian song, when we had 
sung it on the understanding that our name would not
be recorded. We really would like to have our name
deleted from the record, as the Australians have been
very good to us and we should not like them to think
we would do anything to hurt them - most Australians
know nothing about collecting folklore, so would not
understand the angle from which we sang it.

     About your singing the song, - I cannot help 
feeling that it would be better left unsung, as a 
great many Australians are sensitive about Botany Bay,
which was, after all, only a very small settlement in
a vast and freely settled country. Through having
sung the song to you, we should hate to be the cause
of anything being broadcast that would belittle a
people as valiant as they are proving themselves to be.

     We have done part of 'The Fox' over the
radio in Australia and may be doing it here so anyway
we mean to publish it later so please do not use it.

     We would be very willing to give you some 
of the interesting things we have found from time to
time, but we cannot do this unless we are sure that
our rights as performers will be respected - you will,
no doubt, understand this as you are a performer
yourself. We have a very early English version of
'Frogge and Mouse' which we think might interest you
as it is probably the forerunner of the song we find
all over this country.

     With all the very best wishes for the success
of your new book,

Yours sincerely,
