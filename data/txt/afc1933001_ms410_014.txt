Sept. 7, 1937

Mr. John A. Lomax,
1618 Ave. Y,
Lubbock Texas.

Dear Sir:

I have just learned of your desire to include certain
public domain songs (to which we have added new melodies)
in your new collection.  I am pleased and proud
of your interest and have strongly urged my publisher
to grant your request.  And when your book is published,
we shall be pleased to review it in our syndicate
papers.  May much success attend it!

Yours very sincerely,
Sterling Sherwin
