way you want to and have fun and it's good exercise.
It's hard work but it's good for you.  I sleep better
after I dance good.  Do it three times a week.

I:   You all dance two or three times a week?

Man:   Oh, yes, sometimes, whenever we went to France
two years ago we danced every night. 

I:  You mean you went to France?
 
Man:  Yeah.

I:   How was that?  What did you do in France?

Man: Well we went to France two years ago this September,
August, and we danced fourteen days, for France, and
all the good will tour, and travelled all over the place,
all over France and back.

I:   Did you buy all those fancy perfumes and clothes they
had over there?

Woman:   No sir, we didn't get to Paris. 

I:   Oh no.
 
Woman:  We didn't get to Paris.

I:   How did the French folks like you all?

Woman:   They loved us, they loved us, and in turn we loved
them too, really we did.

I:   Did you see any French folk dancing over there, because 
they've got some mightly good dancers.

Woman:   Yessir, we seem some.

I:   Uh huh.  What do you think is the benefit of the clogging
dance in the life of a person.  Is it just fun, give you an
outlet, or what?

Woman:   Fun is the greatest thing there is and you meet nice
people in sessions there.  We love it. Of course eventually 
I think we're going to have to go back to Western dancing
because the clogging's going to get too rough on us older
people.

(Truck or train sounds.)

I:   Is the greatest thing about the square dance and the western
moving together and making formations, or what's the most
fun part of it, the rhthym, or contacting different folks, or
what.
