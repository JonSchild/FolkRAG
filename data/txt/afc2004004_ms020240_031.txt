BJ:  You can't hardly tell who is white sometime.  That go for
womens an' men.  Well, ya see, the thing been goin' on.  So no use
a-worry' about that part.  Ya know!, not none at all!  All ya got
ta do is ta treat people right, that's all!  Let 'em alone; that
been goin' on.  See?  White folks been leavin', they ah, [leavin' their] they
chilren in our houses an' let us carry 'em in out name an' makin'
us take care of 'em.  They been doin' it, for the longest.  It
ain't just now started.  'Way back in ancient times.  [No] So they use a
worryin' about that part, at all.  An' I don't see, I don't know
what they worry about.
An' then he asked me (would they trust or nothin' ?).  Got
no right to treat y'all like that.  He said -- In the workin'
line or nothin'.  You can have what you already have; you can
live what ya wanna live; let us have some of it, an' we all live
together.  That's all.  We don't want everything, 'cause we the,
the big, bigges' peoples to understand.  Then you gittin' close to
Jesus.  You gittin' mo' close to God.  So we can talk to ya about
God.  But now, see, some of us have a desire to talk to ya sometimes,
like to, we love ya.  'Cause it's mo' love; it's just pure
love an' pure thing.  An' ah, so we don't, we don't hate you.  Ain't
got no rea-- right to hate you, not none at all.  But that what a
lot a peoples think.  He said, "That what I hear some of 'em talk
an' think, that they'll die 'casue they think the colored peoples
gonna treat them like they foreparents treated them, they foreparents."
Well, it ain't so.
AL:  They're scared, aren't they?
BJ:  That's right.  That what he told me; he say he hear a lot
a 'em talkin' that, about it.  I said, "Well, they ah," said, "Well,
it ain't so."  So dat's gone is gone.  An' we cain't pay for that.
