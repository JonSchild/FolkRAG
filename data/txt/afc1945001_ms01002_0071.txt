of winning the war, and an equally intense fear of 
being defeated.  It follows that at not other time
is the commonality of sentiments so great.  That
these emotions reenforce the already heightened
social interaction of the people is self-evident

c.  Unsatisfied need of information.  One of the 
first acts of any nation at war is to insure that
military information be kept from the enemy, i.e.,
institute censorship.  Thus fact becomes even less
accessible than in peacetime; but the need for
facts on the part of the people becomes even greater 
than under normal conditions.

d.  Monotony, enforce inactivity and idleness.
During the course of any war, there are long periods 
when hostilities may not be undertaken effectively.
Soldiers are kept in camps, deprived of normal 
relations with the rest of the people, etc. Under
such conditions, they tend to become discontented
and bored.  Such a situation is very predisposing
to the development of rumor.  Again, many of the 
civilian population are in a similar state.  Although
they are vitally concerned with the outcome
of the war, no means are given them to contribute
effectively to the war effort. Here again, this 
enforced non-participation is productive of discontent
and rumors.

XII. How may rumor be employed as propaganda?

Rumor as an instrument of propaganda is of value largely
for the purpose of (a) disrupting a group, (b) creating
a "smoke screen."

a.  Rumor as a disrupting devise.  Here rumor is 
employed to create confusion and doubt, to foster 
distrust of the formal system of communication, to
encourage latent hostilities, and to drive wedges
between leaders and followers.

Example:  During the Polish campaign, the Germans
captured the frontier radio stations and
broadcast news of Polish victories.  This completely
unprepared the populace for the actual
defeats they had suffered and lead to widespread
demoralization once the actualities became known.
Again, the German short wave to America has repeatedly
attempted to start rumors fostering
racial hatreds, disaffection toward the president,
etc.

b.  Rumor as a "smoke screen."  Here rumor is deliberately 
employed to keep the opponent guessing.
