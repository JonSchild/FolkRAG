OFFICE MEMORANDUM

To:               R. Keith Kane, Assistant Director 
 Date:  March 27, 1942

From:          Eugene Katz, Special Service Division [*EK*]

Subject:      Rumor Clinics

I agree with Mr. Studebaker that the matter should
be held in abeyance until the Special Service Division, with
the aid of the Bureau's consultants, reaches a final decision
about how far it wishes to go in the rumor analysis matter.
