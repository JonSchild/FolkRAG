stand, to pay huh insurance.  I cussed mysef out.  Instead of handin huh what she asked me for, I handed
huh fifteen dollars.  I wondered how come me to give her
all that money.  I didn't care bout givin no woman nothin.
Well, I up and give huh more.  After sayin I wasn't gon
do it, I come back an give huh mo.  Kept on that stuff.
Wasn't but two months befo we were married.  We lived together 
five years an after I found out she had a living
husband it was time for me to discard huh.  (She did have
a living husband?)  That's what huh brother told me.
I was married on the 17th of August, year 1919.  You know,
a person do wrong to throw the best part of their life into
someone don't show nothin fer it.  Cause when a man young,
an a woman young, supposed to produce a f amily.  Have
somethin to show fer it.  Ain't that right?  You throw way
all yo life with a person on heah there ain't nobody but
you.  Ain't nothin fer you to claim.  That's bad.  (Did you
feel that you gained anything by your marriage?)  Not anything
but just the woman.  I thought if I got the 
woman that was all right.  That was all the sense I had.
I thought maybe there might be somethin else after while,
me bein a young man.  She didn't even have any children
. . .for me. . . I married when I was twenty-three years
old.  She was twenty-seven then.  She had nice ways about her
all right.  Yeah.  She had nice ways.  Yet on the back of
that she was one of them quarrelin kind of women.  She
did fuss all right.  I never paid huh no 'tention.  I'm
gon tell you why I didn't.  Because I had learnt not to
let nothin worry me bout what nobody said.  Jes anything
