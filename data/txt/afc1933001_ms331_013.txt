In eighteen hundred and
thirty two in merry month
of june i landed in the
hot springs one sultry afternoon
A living [skelent?] walked
to me and he offered
me his paw invited me
to his hotel the best in
Ark-saw.

I followed my conductor
up to his bording place
misery and starvation
was written up on his
face his soup was half
spring water his beef I
couldnt  chaw he charged
me fifty cents a meal in
the state of ark-saw.

They fed me on corn
doger as hard as any
rock my teeth began
to loosen my nees began
to knock. I got so thin
on sasfrac tea I could
hide be hind a straw
