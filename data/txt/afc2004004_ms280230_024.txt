Lomax: And every house you stopped at. . . . . .?
Bell: Well, we used to get a little drop of slog. Slog.
Lomax: Slog? Now that's something new one me. I know about
corn liquor. What's slog?
Bell: Anything you can put on the table!

The Light Dragoon:
. . . . . . . . . . . . . to prove her ruin you quickly shall hear,
Her father was a noble lord, a lord of high renown,
And for her to marry a soldier, it would bring his honor down.
"For it's your birth and my birth, it never will agree,
So take it as a warning, you light dragoon," said he.

2) No warning, no warning, no warning will I take,
I'll marry you today, my love, and I'll die for your sweet sake
As soon as she heard him say so, her tender heart did bleed,
To church they went together, got married with great speed.

3) As they were returning, returning from the church,
The saw herfather coming with several armed men.
"Good Lord," said this lady, "We both shall get slain."
"I never fear the token," the light dragoon said he.

4) "Set forward, stepf forward, there is no time to prattle,"
And don't you see the light dragoon a-fixing for a battle?
He drew his sword, his carbine, which made his hammock to rattle
The lady held the horse while Sir dragoon fought the battle.

5) Now come all you high born ladies who have got gold in store,
And never slight a soldier, let him be ever so poor.
Let him be ever so poor, he'll fight all for his own,
And here's a health to every soldier, likewise a light dragon.

Ben: Look, all these songs I'm singing today is my grandfather's
songs, what I'm singing to you now. My father died at 81 mind you -
and they was handed down from my grand-father to my father, and I
got 'em now as same as was given to me, and I can assure you they
are old songs. There's not -- you don't see many of them today.
Lomax: And this one's older, is it Ben?
Ben: This one is as good.
Lomax: What's the story?
