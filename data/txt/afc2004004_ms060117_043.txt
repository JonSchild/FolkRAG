Dear Alan,

It's good to hear from you after so long a break.  I realise
that it's my fault.  I was busy when I got your last
letter, and, when I finally had time to write, I assumed that
you'd already left for the Caribbean.  I had no idea your
trip was planned for late spring.  I'm of course delighted
that things are moving on the project.  I am not ecstatically
happy with my progress at UCLA.  I've learned almost
nothing here, outside of my very enjoyable and profitable first
experience as a teacher.  I've been spending most of my free 
time on outside projects, such as writing music for a modern 
dance production here, and writing some short stories.  The
only good course I've had all year is one in the Anthropology
Department--Indians of South America.  The music department is
ridden with all kinds of petty politics--the faculty get along
with no one, including each other, and the students dislike
and fear all but a very few.  Graduate students are treated as
property by various faculty people, and the final PhD exams
resemble horse trading or congressional log-rolling more than
anything else.  Hood is one of the few faculty members
who is willing to go out of his way for a student, but even
here one feels that it is all for selfish reasons.  Few of
the faculty are good teachers, the best are merely good
pedants.  Charles Seeger is about the only one that I can 
really talk with intelligently.  He sort of keeps to
himself most of the time, anyway, and most of the faculty
didn't even realize he was there at all till he gave a brilliant
paper before a general colloquium a few weeks ago.
