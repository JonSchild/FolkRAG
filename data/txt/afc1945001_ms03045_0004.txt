Report on Rumors
Attached is the report due in your office August 10,
on rumors heard in various cities in Ohio from August 3 to
August 8.
In your first request dated July 31 you did not ask
that the persons from whom these rumors were heard be identified
as to type, consequently, we have just repeated the
rumor as it was heard. In our next report, we will identify
each rumor as to place, date, and type of individual.
These rumors were heard not only by myself but also
by the local representative of the Civil Service Commission
here in Cleveland in his interviews, by the Assistant Secretary 
of the Warren Chamber of Commerce, and by an insurance
salesman in Columbus who has been contacting several industrial
corporations. These same sources will be used in the 
next Rumor Report with several additional sources.
