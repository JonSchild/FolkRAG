Reverend Roe.  Reel 4.  P. 1
A: Well, what do you think is going to be the solution of it?
R: Well, I don't know. But we know that God said, "Whatsoever shall
man sow, that shall he reap." And every man who has a soul are bound
to reap what he has sown, because we believe the word of God is
true.
Well, after I left home, my father and one of the older sisters with
her family, they cultivated the land until Father died.
A: Did he have a title to it:
R: Oh yeah, it belonged to us, and after my father died, why, for some
cause they got mad with my sister, and a group of white folks went
there and whipped her.
A: You don't know why they got mad? Didn't you ever hear why they 
got mad with her?
R: No sir, I don't know just what it was. I was in Texas.
A: And she never told you:
R: Well, she said she didn't know just why they treated her like that,
but she said she thought it was because they wanted the land.
A: What did they whip her with?
R: A rope, I think. They tied her, and she had the ropes around her
arm and legs, and she was hurt pretty badly. And she had to take all
of her childrenand leave, and she came to Sherman to me, and I had to
look after her until they got on their feet. The boys are still up 
there, one of them, the other just sold out and went to Detroit,
Michigan; he bought up there.
No[w] the white folks down there, if there was something they wanted,
why, they got it. They'd get it if they had to send a mob crowd on
down there, and run you off, and take it. And we knew if they wanted
something, if they keep on after us for it, they said it shoulda --
let them have it to keep from having trouble. That was generally
known down there.
