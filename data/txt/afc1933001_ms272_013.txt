TUNE: Dark Eyes.

Hear my hymn of fight
Breaking thru the night
Dispelling every fear
That was ever near.
Rise up, crush the foe
Never spare a blow,
And we'll make this land
Free for ever more.

Tune: Brown University Song

We've come from all parts of the land
Now we're in Major Carlson's Band
And where our country needs a hand
We will gladly take our stand.

No matter what the mess
There is one thing we stress
It is gung ho, gung ho, gung ho, ho,
We are R*A*I*D*E*R*S*

Tune: The vagabond Song

Sons of toil and danger, will you serve the Major and win
The fight for liberty
Sons of shame and sorrow, will cheer tomorrow for our
Great Democracy
Onward, onward, steal against the foe-Forward, Forward:
The stars and stripes will go; sons of freedom round
Us, lets shake the scum that hound us, and to hell with
Japanese.

RAIDERS ALL ARE WE

Over hill, over dale,
On the sea and on the trail,
We Raiders go raiding along
First we're here,
Then we're there,
Chasing the enemy everywhere,
Keep those Raiders a-rolling along.

Then it's Hi Hi Ho.
Raiders all are we.
We shout it out in voices loud and strong
With our tommies and M ones
We'll get those sons of guns
As we Raiders go raiding along.
