Tape:  Roll 51, Ray and Stan Hicks    3
(Stan)  grab the man and put him on a broom. .  You know, just hold
him on a broomstick and sometimes it'd be broke.  And uh, like
that you know and all.
AL:  Why did you do all that anyway, what was the reason?
Ray:  Like I said a while ago. . . they told me. . .I wasn't worth
serenadin'.  See, I hadn't been no sport out with 'em.  They done
it because they liked 'im!  And I told 'em I just assume they
didn't like me!
Stan:  No, they done a lot of that, you know and that was the way
they serenaded.  This one man got a little bit rough.  One (unint.)
you know, he had two married at one time.  My first cousin married
one of them.  Married two at one time, so said, "Let's have a 
double serenadin'."  And had an old buggy, back then day you went
to church you took them old buggies and red horses.  And the turkeys
was roostin' on this buggy, you know.  And they put about four
sticks of dynamite on the buggy, I don't reckon (unint.). . . . . . .
So when they let if off, the turkeys disappeared, I mean everything
was 'stroyed and it was bad, boy!  They didn't care how much they
tore up!
Ray:  No, it was rough!
Stan:  They didn't care, but if they didn't like you . . .
Ray:  Oh yeah, you had it!
AL:  But when you were young in this country you were supposed to 
act mean for awhile, weren't you?
Stan:  Yeah, before you got married you had to be pretty rough!
Ray:  You had to be rough to get thru!
Stan:  And then these country, to tell you the truth, they made a 
mean shot of liquor.
