BJ:  Well, just, ah, nothin' bad.  That I seen.  Not there.
'Cause he was kinda a strict guy.  An' he's a big guy, an' he
was worthwhile.  He'd put 'em out there if they start anything, I 
believe.
     An' ah, but, he was very magnificent, hisse'f.  He had used
to, years ago -- his name was Seeko Bland, an' his wife was
named Milly; she's a little bit of a woman; he's a great, big
man.  An' he's  tall, an' stroppy (strapping).  He was, he was my
grandmother's first cousin.  They was just big an' stroppy alike.
They would go at. . .!  An', ah, he used to follow great shows long
years before then.  I didn't know 'im then.  I was, I wasn't quite
-- I don't guess I was born.  But, um, he had some of that stuff
an' a whole lot of junk that they used to do.  Very funny things.
You know, that he would do in there.  An' have a big, ah, gatherin',
ya know, in, in there.  Would go in there an' some people
would. . .
TL:  What kinda stuff?
BJ:  Well, lil', ol', funny things.  Jus' like you. . .He gi' you
a quarter an' you hold it down an' you know you got that quarter.
An' he jus' do sumpthin' around there, ya know, an' then ya hol'
ya hand [and] up the quarter not there.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Sli' a hand
(sleight-of-hand) work, ya know.  He had a lot of that stuff.
     An' he make ya look like ya arm is tuk off.  Look jus'
like it.  Look jus' like you ain't got no more'n one arm!  But
jus' tell the peoples.  Oh, we had more. . . !  An' I 'member
one night he asked me, said, let, let him take my arm off.
Man, I went un'neath the table.  Hah!  Say, "You never take my
arm off!"  He wa', he was jus' funny.  Ya know, all a those lil'
funny things we would do.
