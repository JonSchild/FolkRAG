HAITI'S ECONOMIC BONDAGE

By BERNARD SEEMAN

ON July 29, 1915, an American
warship steamed into the outer
harbor of Port-au-Prince, capital
of Haiti, and a regiment of U. S. 
Marines landed, ostensibly to "protect
lives and property." Their actual accomplishment
was to transform Haiti
into an unofficial U. S. possession.
For thirty-one years Haiti's presidents
have been handpicked by the
State Department in Washington,
and its internal economy has been
governed by United States interests,
both governmental and private. The
results are far from savory. Under the
American aegis, government in Haiti
has been corrupt and expensive, providing
little public service in return.
One of the few liberal Haitian senators,
Max L. Hudicourt, has said of
the situation: "The economic influence
of this predatory foreign group
is determining the national life of
Haiti.  Possessors of all the private
capital, they hide behind the puppet
politicians, both mulatto and black, 
whom they control and through
whom they maintain and increase
their own economic power."

Senator Hudicourt's charges describe
conditions familiar from the 
days of Dollar Diplomacy in Latin
America.  But whereas the Good
Neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt
has supplanted the earlier policy
of political intervention for economic
exploitation over most of South
America, Haiti continues in bondage
to the United States.
In August 1946, Deputy Dumarsais
Estime was elected to the presidency
of Haiti and a new government was
installed. The new government gives
indication of some liberal tendencies,
but is it questionable how liberal the
dominant American economic interests
will permit it to be.

The population of Haiti comprises
some three million Negroes, a small
but influential minority of mulattoes,
and a few thousand whites, most of
them Americans.  The whites hold
the economic power.
For generations the bulk of Haiti's
population has lived on the brink of
