Below is a copy of the negotiations between the Adjustment Committee
of Local 28 and the Librarian concerning the promotions policy of
the Library of Congress.

October 27, 1938

Dr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Sir:

Last spring we submitted to you, through the Personnel Officer,
suggestions for a statement to be issued by you in regard to
the promotions policy of the Library of Congress. You did not see
fit to accept the suggestions or to act independently in the matter.
We wish now to submit the following observations upon the subject.

1. Several other governmental agencies in Washington have come to
definite understandings with their locals of the United Federal
Workers of America relative to promotions. One such understanding,
that of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has taken
the shape of a formal, signed agreement. Others, such as those
of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the
Rural Electrification Administration, the Customs Bureau, and
the Bituminous Coal Commission, have been in the form of administrative
orders. We, at the Library of Congress, are not asking
for a formal agreement or even for an administrative order,
but only for an official and explicit statement of the promotions
policy of the Library of Congress as professed verbally by your
subordinates.

2. For any promotions policy to be entirely free of favoritism, it
is necessary that there be made available to all employees notice
of all vacancies that may occur and all new positions that may be
created. Nor can any position be filled by the most efficient 
and most deserving employee unless every employee who so desires
is permitted to submit an application for the position together
with a statement of his qualifications and his claims to a promotion.

3. In asking that seniority within the division be respected, we are
proposing nothing new in personnel administration. Both government
and private business build their personnel morale upon a
recognition of the rights of seniority. In an organization with
a personnel as large as that of the Library of Congress, abstract
seniority rights mean very little in practice, unless coupled
with a considerable measure of divisional exclusiveness, of priority
within the employee's division. Seniority rights are but a 
hollow boast if the employee is not protected in his own division,
if it is the common practice to fill higher positions with
employees from other divisions, even though they may have longer
service records. It will be noted in point 2 of the draft policy
