Dear Dave:

I think you might be interested in the enclosure.
It's not possible for us to include this interesting
subject on the School of the Air programs this year,
but I thought you could use it elsewhere.

Nick encouraged me by what he said about the success
of our program. Do you think that there's a serious
possibility of it's being sold?

If I never before have expressed my appreciation of
your extreme kindness to me and Nick, I want you to know
how deeply [?????] both are to you. Neither the program
nor the present growing interest in American Folk
Songs could have existed without your always tactful and
fertile stimulus. 

With very best regards,
Alan Lomax
