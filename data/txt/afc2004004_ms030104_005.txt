May I add that there are a lot of people 
Who have their names on the church rolls
There are a lot of people who frequent the church building,
Who shall, in the judgement find themselves sent to Hell.

In fact, the church[,] the church [building] 
Is a nice place to go to Hell from.

You know it, certainly it looks better,it sound[s] better To go to Hell from the church   3
Than it does to go to Hell from a dive.

A man gets shot down in a dive,
his people come to the eulogy, the funeral
An they stood around and they lament
They're sorrowful, they're broken[;] 
because their relatives, their loved one                 12
Met death in a dive.

But we who only have [their] our names on the church rolls
We who only pretend to be what we really what we're not,
We who really have not been [*sure enough*]regenerated or born again
Are good for Hell out of the church.

If you think with me for a moment
You'll recall that David
With all -- of his experiences with God,
With even having said of him by God
That he was a man after his own heart --
David got uneasy on a certain occasion
About who was going to heaven and who was going to Hell,
And he said, "Lord
Who shall stand in they holy hill
and who shall dwell in thy holy place.["]

He said, "Well now you told me once
You need not answer any more.

He that hath clean hands and a pure heart
And hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity
Has not sworn deceitfully
And [putteth?] his money out to usury
Or taken up a reproach against his neighbor
But sware to his own hurt,
Say, "He shall  dwell...
But the other fella's going to Hell.

And unless there's some changes made
Some of we folks right out[ta] the church

Christ said on one occasion,
[Say O] 'They're gonna come from all [the] directions
And they're gonna knock an say,
'Lord, [Lord?] open unto us.'"
And he said, "I'm gonna say to 'em [From whence? are you, I don't know you.
[I donâ€™t know ya.]

Say, "Lord we know you.
You 'member when you were in the world
We fed you when you were hungry
We came to the jail to see you
When you were incarcerated in prison,
