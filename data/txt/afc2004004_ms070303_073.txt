bent lady who has the posture 
of a woman who saw her husband 
over her shoulder [o?] she 
was being fucked and remained 
that way.

It is grey out there now &
cold and only a few [scotards?] 
& I'm really old & I can't 
swim far.

Sore hearted.  When I look 
at this strange land turning 
under the rail I know I'm 
sore hearted.  It's too late 
for this to have happened.
