Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
July 18, 1938

I anticipate with great pleasure the discussion of these programs
in detail with you when you are back in the East in the fall, and I anticipate
the concerts as one of the most distinguished features of the entire
music program of the Fair.

I assume I have your permission to include the provisional dates
I mention in this letter in the first provisional outline of the entire
music program of the Fair which I shall soon present to the organization.

Very sincerely yours,

Olin Downes
Director of Music
