   We spent a fine evening together at
the great fair of La Place Nation & then
picked up Blind John Davis, a good
accompanying blues pianist who
has an extraordinary pair of white
wings flying out of his eyebrows

voice is like Jelly's when he says
"Alan, I like any place where
I make money.  And if I don't
make money there, I don't like
it." The voice of the proletarian
who had lost his craft & his
fight but not his bitterness.
