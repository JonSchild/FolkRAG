sit.   He'd spit.  An' tremblin'.   Well, I mean that make you
sick.  To see him set around all the time.  I got tired of it,
myself.  Mama said, "I'll fix 'im.  I'll fix 'im."
           'Cause when work time come -- See, there wasn't nobody
doin' nothin' much then.   Go to work; we was killin' hawgs an'

BJ:    Yeah, I reckon so.   Some of them, back in them bushes, somewhere
or other.   She sure ain't scared, not one bit.
         I'm not scared to stay by myself.   You know, unlessen. . .An'
