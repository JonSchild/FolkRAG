In the second place all the songs in "Our Singing Country",
no matter what their ultimate origin, have the stamp of
America on them; they have functioned and many of them still
do function in the American community. Even the ancient
British and French ballads that have survived here have not
been loved by the people because they represented an old
and longed-for homeland, but because the story or the tune
had meaning in terms of American living. They are as
American, as United Statesian, as you and I; and just as
there are many traits of our own character which cannot be
explained by our diverse national origins, in the same
way there is much about these songs which can only be
understood by references to new growth in this coungry [country],
GROWTH that has come of free contact between racial, national,
and social groups. In our tremendous tradition of folk-music
is less native than Indian music, so to exactly the same
extent are we.

Finally, I say that our folk-song stock is not and
never has been stagnant; some songs are dying; some entire
folk-song stocks and styles are on their last legs; but
out of them and beyond them, new styles and new songs are
growing up, better adapted to survive in the esteem of our
restless, fast-moving and eternally unsatisfied people.
