1939. Country Nicholas Ray. See also [Decca.] Cotton Mill Blues record

49. [48.]  "Chilly Winds."  [A.A.F.S.] a. [#]No.1368[A1]. Acc. by Bog Trotters Band and sung by Fields Ward,
Galaz, Va., [Oct.,] 1937. Another version of this 
appears in John Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath." We
are assured that this has been the song par excellence of
the homeless wanderers of the 1930's, especially the 
"Okies." The tune appears derived from 
the Negro spiritual "I Ain'ta Gonna Study
War No Mo'." See Hu 313.
