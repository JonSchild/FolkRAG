Messrs Lomicke & Spivacke:
At Columbia a group of
illiterate Funeral Home singers
wailed through three torrid
hours into our microphone 
at Mullins, S.C., from them
we got four child ballads and
six or eight other songs. Here a
mixture of blacks and whites
have kept us busy for three
sessions a day - despite the
heat. We go down the 
road past Charleston to
look into the group singers
