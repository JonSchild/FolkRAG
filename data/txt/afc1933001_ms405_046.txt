Ed Nichols' Story 

and butter. I asked the old follow how much I owned him and he 
said nothing but to stop with him any time I was passing. I had 
a roll of twenty dollar bills in greenbacks and thought I would 
never had a better place to unload, so I gave every one a $20 bill 
apiece. There were at least eight children. 
I got to Waco. I owned a $50 suit of clothes, a diamond ring 
and a fine horse and saddle. I was fixed up. I went down, et my 
supper, put my horse in a livery stable, went into Roper's saloon, 
played a game or two of billiards and pool and then walked up into the 
gambling hall upstairs. There was a poker game going on and I got 
broke. I went to two or three boarding houses and couldn't get a bed. 
Coming down the last stairs I found an old blanket, so I took it along 
with me to a lumber yard and went to sleep. I laid out in that lumber
yard and liked to have froze and cussed myself for not giving that old 
man and his children all my money.
