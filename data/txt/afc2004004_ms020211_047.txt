Dear Alan: 

Guy Carawan has just sent me a copy of the fine write-up you gave to
his first Folk Festivals on John's Island.  He has kept me in touch with what
he has been doing there, and it sounds as if he has done a fine piece of work.
We are looking forward to hearing all about it when he returns in May.

That reminded me that we want Bessie Jones and her Sea Islanders out here
during the summer of 1965 for the Folk Music Workshop which always occurs the
first two weeks in July, so if you would like to start building a Western tour
for her around those two weeks, this will give you plenty of time to do it.
As you can see from the Summer Bulletin, which I am sending you, we have a fine
large staff lined up for this summer.

When are you going to be available?  It would be good to have both you and
Bess [* Hawes *] with us some summer.  How about 1965?

Let me know as soon as you can, however, about Bessie, and how many there
will be in her group, and what the cost would be, won't you?

With all best wisher,

Sincerely,
[* Max Krone *]
