Raleigh, North Carolina     August 6, 1942

In talking with a prominent man of this City he stated that there were rumors
that the Draft Board of this City is deferring able bodied men who do not have
dependents and taking boys who have a wife or other dependents to support.  That
partiality is being shown by the Draft Board.  He also stated that there is a
big rumor  that the Draft Board will not take drinkers of intoxicating whiskies.
He stated that he had heard this statement about the Draft Board twenty-five or
thirty times and that ninety percent of the rumors or gossip in this City related
to the Draft Board showing partiality.  This party further stated that it is having
the tendency to tear down the morale of the mothers and fathers who have gone in
the service in that their sons have been drafted into the service and that the
Draft board is permitting  for some reason boys who are  physically able to be in the
service to run around on the streets.  In my opinion this rumor should be
scotched at once if possible in order to eliminate any criticism on the local
Draft Board and at the same time keep the morale of the mothers and fathers who
have sons in the service at a high level.

2.  Which rumors are being told most often>

The rumor relative to the Draft Board in Raleigh, North Carolina is being 
told most often.  The party she talked with stated that he had heard it
approximately twenty-five or thirty times and that each time her talked with someone
who had a son in the service it was the main discussion.  Outside of this one
particular rumor the others I have stated are not widespread at all because I
only heard them one time.
