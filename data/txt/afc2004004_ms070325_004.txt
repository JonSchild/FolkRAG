1952
Apr.14,  Easter Sunday  Paris
   The Ism?alia Club.  A few very
unhealthy looking young men and very
homely women are assembled to listen 
to Jazz, like a group of mourners
at the funeral of a man they do not know
but pretend, because they have 
been told its best, to worship.
    Big Bill is here with Blind John?
Paris, But they have the the blues
no longer.   Mezzrow, their boss, has
become a bourgeois --  with the manner
of the manager of a successful music
publisher.  No more the tough ?????
Jewish bird who found jazz an outlet
for his hostility.
   Big Bill, at least, Has the good sense
to confess that he (has) is not at home 
in Paris and feels merely miserable
