REVEREND GARY DAVIS
REEL X
...That kina woman won't let a man suffah for what he
needs. I ain't speakin bout what he want but what he needs. An when
he need. You know, a real good woman can always look at a man an 
tell what he needs. You know that?
(You don't mean just sex?)
Everything. What sort of service would you be if you yo u 
jist had af feelin fur one man, an didn't have nary feelin fur anothah
one? I'm speakin direct to a standpoint of a sense. You understan?
I don't mean to say fur you to have every man. You know what I mean.
I'm speakin in the line of business of ouwah broad heart of
sympathy. Look at all persons with pity. You can tell when anybody
needs. whether you're willin to give it or no you can tell
when anybody needs. well, thass a woman that's wuth sumpin in the 
worl. You know? See? Yet you still can be fur one man. Have on e man. 
Yet you can see what anothah man needs as well as the one what you got
needs. Now that woman wurth sumpin, ain't she? See? Now if you're
a woman in the worl can't tell what no man needs, you can't tell what
your own man needs. Cause you not much interested bout it. Man, you
see. You can tell what he need whether it's yo place to give it
or no. You don't have to be the one to give it. You can point him to your nearer friends. 
(Rev. Davis, have you ever had many dreams?)
(a low, somewhat shame-faced formal statement) Several
times. Yeah. Several dreams. 
(what were yo ur dreams?)
