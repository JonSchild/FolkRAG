A Sailor's Story

     My sister-in-law's brother
has told me this tale:–
     Down at camp one night a
sailor who was quite intoxicated
was saying silly things and
shouted out "Give Me Liberty or
Give Me Death." One of the
High ranking officers stepped
in and said, Who said that?
The sailor replied "Patrick Henry"
you dumbell! This sounded
rather funny, but not to the
sailor when he woke up and
found himself in the guardhouse
where he had to stay
for a few more days.
