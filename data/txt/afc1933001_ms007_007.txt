JOHN A. LOMAX . ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS - DALLAS TEXAS

Baton Rouge, 8/19/1933.

Dear Mr. Engel:
The machine, after a three
days test on the Louisiana Convict 
farm sixty miles away is still a 
very much unsolved problem
we have made a few fair records
but many more quite
impossibly bad. As fast as 
one difficulty is surmounted
another bobs up. We are back 
today having the machine overhauled
in the Electrical Laboratory
of the University of Louisiana
From here we go on to New 
Orleans where out address will
be Grand Delivery, or Western 
Union offices in case you wire
I fear Mr. Gorwick worked 
too hurriedly. Even parts he reported
