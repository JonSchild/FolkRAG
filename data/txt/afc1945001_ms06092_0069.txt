I don't find in this territory that the
average person is indulging in rumors
very much, unless they are talked about
behind closed doors.  In public places
and in various groups one does not hear
any rumors about the war effort.
Many individuals did attempt to foretell
the time the war would end, the early date
being December 1942, but in the last 30 days
their estimate has changed to the year 1943
and 1944.
