however I've never seen his collection. 
He was sick at time I called. 
I think W Franklin Hoxter (leader 
of NYC choral group) May have entree
there. Both he and Lee speak of 
George Johnson but neither divulged 
his address to me. I think they 
either fear exploitation or wish to 
do it themselves. I don't mind. 
But I think you should know 
if Geo Johnson knows as much 
about spirituals and 19th C ballads 
as they hint he does. It isn't 
up my alley. I want the Irish-English 
or Scotch background songs 
and I think there's enough of them 
in the city to keep me out of 
Satan's hands.
Hope this is any good to you.
Sincerely,
Kay
