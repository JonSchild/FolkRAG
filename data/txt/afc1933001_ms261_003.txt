                    Archive of American Folk Song
                    Annual Report, 1941-42.

During the past year the Archive of American Folk Song has 
experienced a more rapid growth than at any time in its history both in the increase of its collections and in 
their ? h?ll public. 1247 twelve and sixteen inch field record[ing] from N. and S. America,
ammounting to approximately 300 hours of folk-lore recpr dings,
were made for the Archive in the course of the year, while
projects were launched which will bring in a nearly equivalent number of folk songs from both continents during
the next fiscal year. Our publication program 
developed concommitantly. The Check list of the Archive of American
Folk Song, in three volumes, covering the years 1933-1940 appeared; 
A series of thirty representatve pressings of Archive records were prepared
for distribution in North and South America; two series of transcribed
radio programs based on Archive recordings were played on stations all over 
the country; hundreds of duplicate records, made in
the Recording Laboratory, were distributed to Libraries, Universities
and private individuals in both North and South America. The Archive of
American Folk Song had begun to function as a collecting and distributing center for
oral music and literature on a large scale.
