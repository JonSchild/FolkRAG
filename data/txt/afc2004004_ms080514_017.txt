A     We're now rejoicing in the fact that the
lifespan is now increased ah from what it
used to be not very long ago, about 30 years,
ah to 70 or 80, and yet we turn around and
regard this as a, a terrible problem, because
all these old people are on our hands.  Ah, 
since we ah live in smallhouses, ah we're
putting them away in old people's homes,
sort of - sometimes segregated, so they
can't even have any sex life, although we
know that sex continues ah good and strong
until death. 

Ah, but look what we're losing.  We're loo-
we're losing their, their experience and the
kind of resiliency that resides in ah - that, 
that's so much exemplified ah in the ah old
people from other cultures where age is
venerated, where ah the task of old people 
is to pass on culture from generation to
generation.  And so tens of thousands of, of
young kids are growing up without any sense
for their roots, and naturally they go astray
because they don't get that stabilising thing
from - that only the grandparent generation
can give people.
