To date we have only had reports from the two in Knoxville and the drug-store proprietor and Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, Memphis.  We called our other Memphis people yesterday and asked them to be sure to get their listings in the mail last night.  They promised but we have not received a communication from any one of the three.  This may be due to the general delay we are experiencing in receiving mail as a result of the recent move from the Federal Building to the Sterick Building.  All of our mail has been delayed 12 to 48 hours.

If additional reports are received in the next day or two we will send them as supplements.
