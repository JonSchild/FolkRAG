with the wind. I had given the money to Frank
Goodwyn who passed it on (in my presence)
to the Mexicans who spoke no
English. If the bills don't please

but, if you can, try to get my 
money back.

For the past week or so I have
suffered less. I presided at all
the Texas Folk Lore Society gatherings
which apparently was a success.
See your program and Miss
Smith's letter enclosed.

I have cowboy songsters and
yodelers lined up at Abilene, [B?],
Pecos, Alpine and Laredo and
other places all along the route.
It seems to me an awful pity
