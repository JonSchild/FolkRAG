2. A melon shipper who has been operating at Blythe, California, says recruiters from a large defense contractor at Parker, Arizona, came to his packing shed and recruited his workers from under his nose, making it necessary for him to go to El Centro or Phoenix frequently to recruit additional workers, only to have them taken again. This shipper also said he paid 75c per hour for field labor, while the defense contractor paid a minimum of 87 1/2c per hour.
