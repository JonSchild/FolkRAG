Don't Care Where You Bury My Body.
[Annie, sing that song that your father sang now.]
Oh, all right. [What you want] would you want me to sing it like old folks sing it - [?]
A: Yes mam.
Don't care where you bury my body,
I don't care where you bury my body,
I don't care where you bury my body.
Know my little soul gonna [ride in style] rise & fly.
Bury my body in Egypt land,
Bury my body in Egypt land,
You can bury my body in Egypt land.
I know my little soul gonna [ride in style] rise & fly.
W: Wow I don't know what else it says.
A: Is that all of it?
W: There might be something else. (asking another woman) Anything else to it? Let me see -- something more of it. There ain't all of it. There's something more but I can't think of it.
A: Where did you learn that?
W: Oh, I just learn[ed] it in coming on up, you know. Old folks were singing it.
A: Who [taught] sang it to you, do you remember?
[* [?] remembering - strong strong old voice*]
W: My grandmaw, sitting down in the corner. My grandmaw [Nasla] Nana Cameron sitting down in the corner holding the baby, patting him, [in the rocker] rocking him, and singing that "I don't care where you bury my body."
A: How long ago was that?
W: How long ago was that been? Well, I couldn't -- let me see now. No, I [ain't been] wasn' no baby. I was[n't nothing] nussin' myself. I was 16 years old at that time.
A: Was your grandmaw a good singer?
W: Well, sung like old folks [who sang] did sing along that time (laughter). Now, [when] whether she was a good singer I [wasn't here] didn't know.
A: You liked it, did you?
W: Yeah. I liked to hear my grandmaw sing anything she could sing.
