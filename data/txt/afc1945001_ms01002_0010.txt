Dear Bob:

Some organizational difficulties have cropped up in Washington. In a day or so they will be ironed out and I shall then be able to send you a complete account of how things stand and where we go from here. I apologize for the delay. Please be patient.

Better not mention Rumor Clinics to anyone for the moment. However, if you can spare the time to keep me informed of what is happening in Boston I will be very appreciative. Will answer the technical questions in your letter in a day or so.

Best wishes,

George A. Nelson, Jr.
