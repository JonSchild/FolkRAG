August 4 There were several spies who returned on the S. S.
Drottingholm, who it is felt, the F.B.I. failed to 
apprehend. [*3*]

August 6 The southern white man and his prejudice, together
with his determined effort to deny Negroes just and
equal rights under a democratic government, caused
the President's Fair Employment Practices Committee
to lose its independence and its being assigned to
the Federal Social Security Board. [*5*]

August 6 Great Britain is letting American do all the fighting
and money spending in order to protect her colonial
possession. (This rumor is heard quite frequently.) [*2*]

August 12 America's failure to support a second front as requested
by Russia is due to the conservative thought of the
administrators and military leaders as Russia may demand
at the peace table that the democracies demonstrate,
rather than talk.

August 13 Conditions under Japan and Germany could be no worse for
certain groups than that now endured under men like
Bankhead, Talmadge and Dickinson, and the Ku Klux Klan.

August 14 Among America's handicaps in winning the war and
rendering as much assistance as could be given to
the United Nations is due to the continued fights
and bickerings among politicians, industrialists,
and labor leaders.

August 14 The United States is fighting in the World War and
will be involved in a civil war unless the south is
made to realize that the winning of democracy for
the world is more important than their continued
practices of discrimination and segregation. [*5*]

August 14 The question has been raised--Why is it that territory
taken by the Japs is always nonâ€“important, yet prior to
their occupancy it was a focal point which needed defending
by America? The people should be told the truth
about our losses as well as our gains in this war and
news concerning the war should be frank in all respects. [*3*]
