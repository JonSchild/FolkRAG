AL:  What do you call that, Bessie?
BJ:  A moan?  It's a moan of Zion's.  'Cause a Zion moan, you

come up from prayer.  But it's mos'ly goin' down in prayer
an' they all moan while they prayin'.  That's a old song.  (HUMS
A LINE).  I, I knowed it in 1908, when I was very little. An'
from then on up I been hearin' it.  Since 1908, oh, yeah.  I
remember good when it came out.  'Mong, 'mong ourselves, at least
'cause we remember.
It's ah, this other song about, that went along with

     Have mercy, (MACHINE TURNED OFF: THEN)
