The many smaller collections of records now in the hands of private
individuals and institutions of learning can be made generally useful and 
helpfully enhanced by the Library's duplicating set-up. It is planned to 
duplicate gradually all such records and thus bring together in one central
depository all materials necessary for the study and understanding of American
folk music. The plan envisages a central depository at the Library and a 
system of State and local Archives cooperating with the Washington collection.

A GENERAL MUSICAL PROGRAM
The sound studio of the Library will not limit its interests, however,
to American folk music. History, literature, art, printing, rare books 
and science can be brought closer to the American people by means of this
phonoduplication service, and the great treasures of music from all countries
can be made available.  The National Library is unique among institutions of
its kind in possessing the Coolidge Auditorium where first performances of the
works of contemporary composers and of rare musical works, available only in
manuscript, take place.  This auditorium is to be permanently wired to the
sound studio and concert performances, which have been broadcast in part in
the past, will be recorded in their entirety for purposes of preservation.
Thus, contemporary composers in all parts of the country will be widely heard
and will have the opportunity of hearing the work of their colleagues. The
Library's vast collections of unrecorded and unpublished music in manuscript,
especially the compositions of 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th century composers,
will be made generally available through records and radio transcriptions.
Music students and composers in all parts of the world will be able to use
and study music that would not otherwise be accessible to them in its present
