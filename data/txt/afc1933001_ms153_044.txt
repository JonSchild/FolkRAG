I should like to recommend that the songs in Miss Newcomb's
collection be recorded by the Archive of American Folk-Song by the
Radio Division of the Department of Interior. The collection consists
of approximately 200 songs from central Kentucky and will require
in the neighborhood of 80-12 inch disks to record. Mr. Allan has
expressed his interest in assisting in this work to the extent of
asking for official leave for Miss Newcomb who works for the Bituminous
Coal Commission. The recording will be done at cost.
