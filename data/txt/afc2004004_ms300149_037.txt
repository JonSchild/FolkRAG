Mr Alan Lomax
Kind Sir,
I want to thank you very
much for the check for the 
amount 34.76 which came in
a time when I needed it most
as I just lost my wife. and I
had to have an eye operation
last month.
Many Thanks again and I
am looking forward to hearing
the records
Best wishes always.
Respectfully yours,
Joe Armstrong
