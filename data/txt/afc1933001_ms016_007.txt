The present situation is: Our machine 
is now making the best records 
of its history. It is heavier, but far 
more durable and less likely to 
get out of repair. We have had 
made another section that keeps 
our batteries charged without trouble, 
delay or expense. The records we 
have made this week are free of 
screeches and scratches and will 
I think please even your sensitive 
ear. Mr. [Stevens?] kindly agreed 
to take care of all this expense 
out of the appropriation he had 
already granted me.

I have, as you see, put off 
telling you of our troubles 
until we were able to say that 
they were over and the work 
going forward. If I have erred 
in this I am sorry.
