[3.] 

She got away down on the river side, 
She wanted to see her old man drown. 
He says, "My dear, kind wife.[,] I cannot drown 
Unless you shove me in" - 

Love my darlin', oh! 
I love my darlin', oh! 

She gits way back, takin' a long, runnin' start, 
She goin' shove her old man in, 
Old man stepped just a little one side 
And headlong she jumps in - 

Love my darlin', oh! 
I love my darlin', oh! 

Old man being so kind-hearted, 
Knowin', too, de sweet wife could not swim, 
He reached right  back and he got a long pole 
And he shoved her further in - 

Love my darlin', oh! 
I love my darlin', oh! 

And she whoops and she hollers, 
Jest as loud as any woman can squall; 
Old man says, "My dear kind wife, 
I'm blind and can't see at all" - 

Love my darlin', oh! 
I love my darlin', oh! 

Says, come all you young, hasty women, 
Take warning after me; 
Don't never try to down a poor old man 
Says he's blind and cannot see - 

Love my darlin', oh! 
Two-eyed ride a babe (sic) !
