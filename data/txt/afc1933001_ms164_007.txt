Memorandum to Dr. Spivacke
December 3, 1940

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

The only photographs of this kind of foreign
crafts which we have in the Archive is a color movie
of a Finnish Magic Curing Ceremony which I took in
the upper peninsula of Michigan. I suggest that MR.
Davis be sent copies of the Annual Report for the
Archive and a copy of the check list when it is completed.
