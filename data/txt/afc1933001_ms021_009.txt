folk-song projects, such as (a) inducing Professor Frank C. Brown
of Duke University to publish the large and valuable North Carolina
collection and (b) to consider whether the time has not come when an
American supplement to the big Child collection should not be issued.

2. Another thing that should be done at the first
opportunity should be to bring plans of the Committee before the Modern
Language Association for approval and apply through Dr. Percy W. Long,
Chairman of the Committee on Research Activities, for financial aid to
carry on the work of the Committee. The securing of this aid will, of
course, depend upon whether we can outline a sufficiently definite and
attractive program of work to induce the Committee to help us.

These are two foundation undertakings that I believe
our Committee should consider. Please think over these possibilities
that face us and write me freely your ideas and suggestions. Professor
R. S. Boggs, Chairman of the Committee on Folk-Lore, who has charge
of the program for the Folk-Lore Section of the Modern Language Association
meeting at its approaching session in Swarthmore, has listed
me for a paper on "A Survey of Recent Activities in American Balladry,
to be followed by a report of the Committee appointed to make recommendations
concerning a proposed group project in the gathering and study
of American balladry. Discussion of and action on this report may be
taken by the group at any time."

I am wondering if you will attend the Swarthmore
meeting, and, if so, whether we could not have a Committee meeting
before the session of the folk-lore group and shape up a good report.
If this is impossible we will have to do it through the slower and
less satisfactory method of correspondence.

It seems to me that the Committee has a fine chance of
doing something of permanent and constructive value if we just go about
and discouragements that are sure to face us. Please write me freely
on anything suggested by this letter.

Yours sincerely,

Reed Smith
