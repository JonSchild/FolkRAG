Dear Mr Lomax
I had a look through the
Raido Times and I was quite pleased
to see that you are back at the 
B.B.C. on friday night
I have an old song that a French
Canadain and myself made up
while we were shipmates on
a 4 Mast Topsail Schooner
coming from Durban S.A to
South America it is called the
Saliors A.B.C. naming every part
of a sailing vessel, I sang it
in your home state - Galveston
at the Saliors Home in 1914 Market
St. also Beaumont Port Arthur
