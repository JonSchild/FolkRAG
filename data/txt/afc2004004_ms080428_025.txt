ROLL 2                           10

                                      started in the mountains and the
                                      culture just kept on growing and it
                                      has lead to the growth of one of 
                                      Americas most wonderful orchestras,
                                      the blue grass, the five piece blue             IN
                                      grass band which in its way is just
                                      as exciting as the five piece hot or 
                                      black orchestra from New Orleans. It 
                                      came a little later, I think
                                      somewhat stimulated and somewhat 
                                      competitive with the black orchestra                                      
                                      but there it is now and the blue 
                                      grass band is just as popular in 
                                      Tokyo and East Germany as it is in 
                                      New York, in fact a good deal more 
                                      so probably.

MAN                             It is the way you have a dance 
                                      without any instruments in a small
                                     place. 

INTERVIEWER                Oh I know who does it amazingly 
                                      well, The Brissle Singers, when you 
                                      dance. They are fantastic, I've seen 
                                      them dance to that. 

MAN                               It is generally, it is, it is the 
                                      characteristic form of North West 
                                      Europe because North West Europe is
                                      the tag end of the Arctic and, here
                                      me this now, all American Indians do
