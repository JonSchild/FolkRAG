MRS. JEANETTE WOGAN ARGUEDOS, who interprets forms of
the Voodoo ceremonials, the street cries and other customs that
are known only to Louisianians.

She has at her command a wealth of folklore learned in
her childhood; in fact, no one in New Orleans and Louisiana
is more able to give a vivid picture of the old customs and
traditions.

A Creole by birth, she is a member of one of New Orleans'
most distinguished and musical families and is a recognized
authority in her line.
