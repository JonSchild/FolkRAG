Joe: Yes, yes... they used to sing.
(Here follows some discussion of song,s with no result.....)
Then.....
1) As I was out walking one fine Sunday morning,
I started to creep to a lady a-sleeping.
She blushed and she smiled when she saw I was peeping,
What made you come over this way?
2) I said, "Pretty darling I'd like to come to you,"
She smiled and replied, "I'm afraid you'll undo me,
So please will you stay away?"
3) I said, "O my darling, I will not undo you."
She smiled and replied, "Then you come to bed to me."
Sing fal the ral doodle-ol-day.
4) My clothes are too tight, I cannot undo them. (2)
She quickly replied, "Then get your knife to them." (Refrain.)
5) "My knife it won't cut it's as rusty as tinder,
My knife it won't cut for it ain't worth a cinder."
She quickly replied, "There's a knife in the window." (ref.)
6) O into her bed then I very soon tumbled,
And all you must guess how this young couple fumbled. (Ref.)
That's the finish of that. That's the version I picked up.
Lomax: Where did you get that, Arthur?
Arthur: From Harry and different blokes out Sackford way.

(Pause.)
Yeah, I know Barbara Allen.
1) In Scotland I was bred and born,
In London was my dwelling,
Till I courted a pretty fair maid,
Her name was Barbrie Allen.
2) I courted her four weeks and months
Four weeks and months together,
Till she did prove untrue to me,
Her name was Barbrie Allen.
