Dear Duncan,
I didn't reply quickly to your last letter because I was worried
about the restriction problem.  A good bit of the recording I am going
to do will be not only pretty intimate interview material but also
will have a sturdy social content.  Such records should be restricted
for quite a long time.
My solution has been this: (1) to keep aside those of the records
which might possible cause difficulties for the informants and for
the Library, (2) to place on the interview material submitted a ten year
restriction, (3) to agree to the usual two year restriction on the
musical recordings.  O.K.?
I will be ordering some dubs soon.  Many thanks and I hope I can get
my blanks before the fifteenth.  Mrs. Gladden and her brother are
coming here to spend a week with me.
Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax

P.S. The last I heard of Pete Steele was that he worked for the
Champion Paper Mills in Hamilton, Ohio.
PP.S. to Rae Korson:
In the first set of Library records we issued a side called
JUMPIN' JUDY sung by a Negro convict named Kelly Pace.  Would you
be so kind as to look in the files and send me the last address we
had for that man?
