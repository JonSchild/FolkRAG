Grade 12

Two privates were discussing 
the food they had had for 
breakfast.

Al - Boy, that bacon sure was 
good that we had wasn't it?
Gene- Yes, Sir! You know two
pounds of bacon went 
clear around the mess table.
Al - Well, it should. When they 
served it, they dipped 
out the grease and saved
the bacon. I reckon they 
saved the bacon for the 
officers.
