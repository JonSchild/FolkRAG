Dear Ed:
     I assume from your letter that you have not been
able to obtain many bookings for the Sea Island Singers so
far. Meantime, they had an extraordinarily successful appearance 
in Minneapolis and a local but reliable agency has asked
for a three week tour for them in the Fall beginning October 19
with an option to continue to book them in the middle west,
"west from Chicago to Denver and south from Canada to Missouri."
This looks like a good brake for them and I am probably going
to sign.  Would you be interested in turning over your Oxford
booking to this agency for the group's benefit?
     They are going to ask between $400 and $700 per performance.
     I am definitely not interested in performing this year
outside of my regular literacy engagements.  The group will not
be in the east at the end of June as far as I know, so I do not
see how they could afford to come.  Perhaps you would like to
have Mable, Bessie and John for $400 plus bus fare at Hartford.
     I am still, of course, interested in what you can produce
for the group on the west coast, but I think it has always
been our understanding that you have no formal managerial relationship
to them.  Do you have any nibbles yet as far as
bookings are concerned?
     I hope your festival was a great success.  I wish I
could have been there.  Power to you in your work as a creative
manager!
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
