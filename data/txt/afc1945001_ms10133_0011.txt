I. There was a little Moron in the Army,
and the Captain was giving commands
and he said: Squad left, squad
right, and squad halt, but the
little Moron went on, so he again
said Squad halt, the little Moron
still marched on. Well after
seeing the little Moron still
marching, the Captain thought
something was wrong, so he went
up to the little Moron and asked
if he heard him, the little
moron turned around and said
I heard you, but my name is 
Time, and Time Marches On, so
on he went.

II I was asked a question: Why is
the Negro good enough to fight 
for his country so that it might
be free, but [yet] why isn't he yet
free? Can you answer this question
for me?
