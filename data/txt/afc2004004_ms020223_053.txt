away from it.
TL: Did a while buncha people come...?
BJ: Yeah, well, sometime jus' 3 or 4. Jus!, jus' the family.
Sometime a whole crowd of 'em will come an' do it. An' then,
den, when you get through that, ya got plen'y a peas. They'll
last ya down through the summer, ya know, I mean through the
winter, I mean.
An' then, um, we'd do that. An' that, that's a great savings;

beef, see? We'd keep dried beef on hand sometimes. If we ain't
got it, some one else is, ya know? Well, that's the way it goes.
Most all of 'em got dried beef.
