liesure enough to think. The last I 
heard of this machine (a month ago) it wouldn't 
work and I asked that it 
be made serviceable before it 
was shipped.

Your letter with your note 
enclosed came today. I'm glad
I could help now, but I feel 
I ought to say that the bottom of 
my chest is reached - I have 
less than a hundred dollars in 
the Bank and I Must Take 
care of Bess Brown.

You know precisely what 
I think of the futility of your scattered 
activities and so I will 
brave the "procession of the equinoxes" 
to demonstrate the truth to you.
Lovingly,
Father
