Mr. Cornelius DuBois

5. It should provide additional insights into the state of American opinion on various issues. 

It is proposed that the final processing of this study will take the form of  a series of special reports:

1. These recommendations.

2. A special report on the field of study by the Intensive Surveys Division.

3. A special Bureau report on rumor for circulation amongst Government officials. In the preparation of this the working committee would like the cooperation of the writing up and perhaps throughout the actual preparation of the draft, inasmuch as this would require selection from the material available. 

4. A special report on this particular rumor study which could be circulated to people in the field who cooperated in this project with editing of the materials so that nothing would be distributed which might do harm if circulated amongst people who do not understand the need for keeping such reports confidential. 

5. A special guide to rumor reporters would be used in the developing of field staff for the continuing rumor study.
