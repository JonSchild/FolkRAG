Kansas City, Missouri, August 4 ---- It's the big oil companies that are trying to control the synthetic rubber program. If these big industrialists and the farm bloc outfit would take their fingers out of the pie, the public could have an adequate supply of synthetic rubber for necessary driving. It looks like Washington is letting the farm bunch

and the bigwigs in the oil business jockey around with the synthetic rubber deal and the public is holding the sack.
