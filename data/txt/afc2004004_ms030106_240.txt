Wanted to show JR at a dance of G.M's and then the people went nuts.
Andy Kirk made friends.  G.M. was booking gigs-(Anita had gone back to
J.A.- were corresponding).  JR had $20,000.000 in cask and a lot of diamonds-
met pal Goldstucker from Pensacola ( the brother of the man who
inc. him to beat up Stella Taylor) and began gambling with one of the
biggest gamblers Ben Hooper ( negro) there .  JR lost a lot of money- 
about May or June, JR was broke- soaked his jewelry- next morning got a
wire from Anita that grandmother whom he had established in a country place
near Los Angeles,-
"Nan and dad both at point of death.  Mother must undergo an operation
and the baby's( one of her brother's children) blind". 
He became frantic- had 30 cents - ashamed to wire for money- decided
to hobo.  Was lucky- met a man who wanted him for a dance- demanded
five dollars deposit- his worst suit was $90.00- called expressman and
asked him as a favor to bring his trunks to theodepot- JR knew what time
the passenger train was coming- worried- picked up his bag and went to
the depot-JR found the expressman waiting on the platform- bawled them out-
jived he had left his money at Ramsey's poolroom- out talked them and they
left.  Train pulled out with JR on the blinds ( between the first and second
cars).  Put off at Colorado Springs- stalled around, played piano, caught
a freight as far as Pueblo and anotherfreight to Los Angeles.  Before I left 
Denver I was engaged with Gus West( a prizefight manager) and Kid Lee ( a 
prizefighter), and Handy( a chaffeur) making whiskey and delivering whiskey.
JR -salesman and helped drive- made a lot of money.  JR double crossed Gus
who wasn't making money with his young Sam Langford-  JR suggested they not
let him train and bring Nubby Joe Ganns from N. O. to fight- raised $1000
