August 3: In talking to an acquaintance on the street who
is a postal clerk, the acquaintance made the
following statement, "We have lost 88 men in the post office
and I do not see how we can continue to give the same good
mail service to the public as we have been doing. However,
the bosses do not seem to be worried about making necessary
replacements."  37  Denver
