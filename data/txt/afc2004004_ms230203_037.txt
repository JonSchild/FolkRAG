SIB: An'-uh the thing about it...you take a fella that haven' never had
nothin' in his life...(I HAD UNFORTUNATELY INTERRUPTED WITH A QUESTION ABOUT THE LORENTZ BROTHERS AND BILL FINALLY CHANGED TO THIS SUBJECT) Now, Natchez, the thing is I wanted to-uh get straightened out about --- do you know these-uh, the Loran brothers? How many of 'em do you know? 

NATCHEZ: Well, I-I don' know, Sib, it was quite a few of those people an' they 
lived a long time. I mean, I think they was somethin' like-uh the Rockefellers or somethin' like that. You know, if one die...every kid born he was a Loran..

SIB: Tha's right. 

NATCHEZ: JR., the third, the fourth, the fifth, they always have been an' there is now..

SIB: That's right. 

NATCHEZ: ..Loran brothers...
