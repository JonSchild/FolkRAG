Dear Alan: The President of Fisk
University, Nashville, was
out to see me yesterday,
talking mainly about you.
He declares that he's going to put
his music faculty and students
to work on Negro
secular songs. It'll be a slow
process though I'll watch it
with interest

He was much disappointed
that you could not come
for a lecture. The Faculty, amazing
to know, is divided equally between
whites and Negroes.
Lovingly, - Father.
