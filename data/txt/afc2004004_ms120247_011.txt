of the possessed and the language of the gods is "langage"
or "Guinea talk".

The next song was a Yen Valou to Papa Damballa,
Papa Damballa Wedo Tocan Culev', the master of the rainbow,
the snake whose sign is the sign of the lightning, probably
the most universally known of the Haitian 
gods, and certainly the master of the Le Roux hounfort. He is 
Theoline's mait' tete, or patron.

(50B1)
Damballa Wedo, Augus'-o,
Sens moin we nou' ye,
Damballa Wedo, Augus'-o,
etc.,

Two more Yen Valous were sung, invoking Damballa, but he did
not appear.

(50B3)*
Damballa Wedo shitta la,
Siyan-o----,
Damballa Wedo shitta la,
Siyan-a----,
Siyan-o, Bon Dieu,
Siyan, poto mitans moin,
Siyan-o, Bon Dieu,
Siyan poto con moin,
etc.,

Damballa Wedo sits here,
Poor devil,
Damballa Wedo sits here,
Poor deil,
