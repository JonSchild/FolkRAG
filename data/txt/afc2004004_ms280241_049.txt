12) Her father soon a letter wrote
AND he sent it on to Fyvie,
For to tell his daughter was bewitched
By his servant Andrew Lammie.
13) It's up the stair to his trumpeter
He called him soon and shortly,
Pray tell me son what is this you've done
To Tiftie's donnie Annie.
14) It's woe be to the miller Tifty's pride,
For it has ruined many,
And they have said that she should not wed
With the trumpeer of Fyvie.
15) O where shall I find a boy so kind
That will carry a letter canny?
And who'll run on to Tifty's glen
Gie that to my love Annie.
16) For Tifty he has daughters three,
And they all are wondrous bonnie,
But you will ken her o' the rest,
Gae that to my love Annie.
17) For you will come to bridge of Sigh
Where I will come and meet you,
And it's there we will renew our love
Before I gang and leave you.
15) I'll buy to you a brand new gown,
My love, I'll buy it bonny,
But ere you come back I will be dead,
In the green churchyard o" Fyvie.
19) Her father struck her with his sword,
AND also did her sisters,
Her brother broke her back as they held o'er,
For the loving of Andrew Lammie.
20) O if you strike me, I will cry,
And gentlemen will hear me,
LOrd Fyvie he'll come riding by
And he'll come in and see me.
21) O Annie dear, O Annie dear,
I can hear your cowie lowin,
"For I wouldna gie my cowie low
For all your kye in Fyvie.
