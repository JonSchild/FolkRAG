Keppard first greatest jazz trumpet player. Eddie Vincent -

The first musicians out of New Orleans who went
to Chicago was Tony Jackson and Bob Caldwell. Tony
was the world's greatest single-handed entertainer.
They went to Chicago in 1905. Bob Caldwell was an
ordinary pianist. Both Jackson and Caldwell was sissies.
They were known as "macommeres". Of course, they were very
careful in New Orleans, but it leaked out. Tony and I
were very good friends and all of the musicians were very
close to each other. Tony told me about Chicago, but 
said the money was not like New Orleans, but he liked it

The Creole Band continued on its way to New York on
its agency planned trip. In New York they played the most
prominent spot in 1914 - the Palace Theater. It was
known that no acts played the Palace Theater more than a

and they held them for a second week, breaking all box-
office attendance of the Palace Theater. They were booked
by the Weber Simon Agency, with offices in the Palace
Theater Building. After this two week engagement, the
town admitted it was the most exciting type of music ever
heard in New York.

During this time there was a show, considered the 
greatest show, entitled "Town Topics". The trip was ended
there but the agents hired them for this show for another
act and the stole the whole dog-gone show.

In this band there was a comedian, Morgan Prince and
his trained chicken. He lives in Tacoma, Washington, if
he is still living.

Everyone of the bunch drank up everything they could
find, including the leader. There was hardly a day but
what almost all of them was late. They started to break
