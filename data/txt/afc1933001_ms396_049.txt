[had me appointed to a Sheldon Travelling Fellowship for the
Collection and Preservation of American Ballads.] I held this
fellowship for three years, travelling all over the West with
a cheap recording machine on which I secured in crude fashion
the tunes of the songs. This work brought me invitations to
lecture in colleges throughout the country during my vacations.
Everywhere I went I asked for the help of my student audiences.
The two books of cowboy songs and cowboy verse were published,
and afterward the folk song project lagged over a period of
some years though material continued to flood my mail.
