Oscar (Buddy) Woods, Jon Harris,
Kid West [of Shreveport, Louisiana,]
are all professional negro guitarists
and singers of Texas Avenue, Shreveport,
Louisiana. The songs I have
recorded are among those
they use to [persuade] cajole [nickels] nickles
from the pockets of listeners. One
night I sat an hour where
the group was playing in [an]
[eating] a restaurant where [meals?]
drinks were served. I was the
only person who dropped
a contribution in the can. I 
doubt if the proprietor paid
them anything
