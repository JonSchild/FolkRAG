"You know why we haven't bombed Tokyo? It is because the Japs
have threatened reprisals on American prisoners over there, but
I don't think that ought to hold them back. Bombing Tokyo is too
important." (Electrical contractor, Birmingham 8/8/42.)

"I don't think the government is going to put those saboteurs to
death. They ought to go ahead and put them to death without so
much delay, like they do in any other country, but if they intend
doing that I don't see why they would have all this red tap."
(Birmingham business man 8/8/42)

" I am glad the saboteurs were put to death. They took that risk
when they entered this country. I can't understand why all of
that procedure was gone through." (Business man, Birmingham, 8/10/42.)

"We are sending too many ships to England carrying men and not
materials. What England needs is materials; they have enough men
and our manpower is needed more somewhere else." (White collar
worker, Birmingham, 8/10/42.)

"I wouldn't go to Murmansk again in a convoy for anything in the
world without air protection and United States Navy escorts. Every
man in the convoy I saw said the same thing." (Merchant seaman
shortly after return from Murmansk trip, Birmingham, 8/10/42.)

"I heard that about half of the Murmansk convoy was lost. Most of
it in Murmansk harbor after reaching port. Only three vessels lost
at sea, two to dive bombers and one to a submarine." (Newspaper man,
Birmingham, 8/12/42.)
