Life in the Army

Life in the army is not easy when 
there is a war. The army takes the men 
we love. Men from all over the world go to 
fight.

When there is a war men must 
fight so that we may have what 
our forefathers made fore us, so that 
our children and our children's children 
may also have what our forefathers 
fought fore and won: liberty for all.

Many of these men may not come 
back for along time; others will never 
come back, but as long as there is a 
war against our from of living.
We will fight to defend it.
