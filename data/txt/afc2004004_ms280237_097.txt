the start, I should think. That's the - that's the queen, so I
should think that's the leadin' one.
Lomax: And was this song sung by the fishermen round where you
live?
Cox: Well, that have been. I have heard 'em sing it. That's what -
that's really what it come from, I should think, that's sort of
a sea-goin' song.
Kennedy: You've remembered three more verses since a few minutes

Cox: Course, I mean if you. . . that's a rum job. . .I should think

It's of a brisk young ploughboy, he was ploughing on the plain,
And his horses stood down in yonder shade,
It was down in yonder grove, he went whistling to his plough,
And by chance there he met a pretty maid, pretty maid,
An' by chance there he met a pretty maid.

So the song that they sang as they walked along,
"Pretty mad, oh you are of high degree.
If I should fall in love and your parents they should prove
Oh, the next thing they would send me to the sea, to the sea,
Oh, the next thing they would send me to the sea."

So when her aged parent he came for to know,
That her love he was ploughing on the plain,
They sent for the pressgang and pressed her love away,
An' they sent him to the wars to be slain, to be slain,
An' they sent him to the wars to be slain.
