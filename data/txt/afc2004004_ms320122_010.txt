MR. FOUGET     Oh yeah, yeah. I know. But 
he got killed, all the bullies got killed.
A. LOMAX          Tell about it, what happened.
MR. FOUGET      Well the, we had [a killing 
right here in the crowded room]. Well them bullies, you 
know, most of them, they call them [boulays]. Like my uncle 
there, he was about 15 years old, when you start to go out, 
you know. But he was pretty well built for his age, you 
know. They went right on this side of [Mark's] place there. 
They had a, a place that they opened, a hall we called that, 
a dance hall. So he went there and they start picking at 
him, two married, three married man, you know. And he's a 
young boy, just, he didn't want no trouble. He'd leave instead. 
And they kept picking at him and they kept going at him, 
'till somebody passed close to him and give him a old 38 to 
defend himself. So he didn't want any, but he was young, 
you know. But the man came with a dagger and stuck him 
right here, in the cheek right here with that dagger. When 
he stuck him with that dagger he shot him. It was right 
close. Shot him with that 38. When he fell there his 
brother came and he shot him, too. Then he still didn't 
know what to do. So the old people went, grabbed him, 
pulled him out, you know, and sent him home. And ever since 
that he, everytime, and my grandpa told me, he was a, I 
didn't know him, I don't remember him at all, but my grandpa
