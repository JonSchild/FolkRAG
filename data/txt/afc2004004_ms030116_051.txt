Rev. D:  Nor to be where your husband is.
Mrs. D:  That was jis kina the wrong tim e with her an thass why she y ield
so quickly.
Rev. D:  Well the Gospel got to go on all the time.  It's not so with man.
Johnny:  By George, now you got a point there.  Of course, r emember
that it was a woman th at carried the word.  That got him out of
the tomb.
(Bedlam breaks out as everyone beg ins to argue this point.)
Rev. D:  Whoa! Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!  I'm not goin to have that.
Wait.  Just wait.  Thass not so.  They went th ere to find him in the tomp
but h e was gone when they got there --
Johnny:  Bu t wh at about the angel in the garden?  Remember -- wasn't it
Mary -- h e said "Don't touch --"
Rev. D:  He was done out th ere.  Thass what I'm tryin to tell you now.
Mrs. D:  She's the one that carried the first message.  A woman is all right
to carry the message.
Rev. D:  She's all right to carry anything but she's not all right to use it.
Mrs. D:  I'll not fight against her.
Rev. D:  I'll say it to anyone.  Rig ht before his face.  I don't care who it
is.  God or anyone -- God never sent no woman to preach the gospel.
Mrs. D:  A matter of fact, it's so many mens do not live the life of a woman
Rev. D: (opposes his voice sharply to h ers.  They drown each oth er
out in clashing words for a moment)  God made men --
Mrs. D:  -- a whole lot of men --
Rev. D:  Thass reason why so many women today is standin on their h eads instead
of standin on their feet cause they're tr yin to take man's place.
Mrs. D:  Most women tries to lead a good honest life -- a decent life--
Rev. D:  Most women?
Mrs. D:  That's right.
