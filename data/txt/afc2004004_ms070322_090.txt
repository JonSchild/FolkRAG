of Italy, but really the light
must have been blue grey as
now - and always the wind
whistling from Scotland, making
a melancholy harp of the
black trees
Roman tunics & kilts?
This is top of the world
country. The hills in the
mist far off seem the
limits of living, and the
landscape with its black
scarps of cliffs seems endless.
I won't try to make
this into good literature
or even a true diary. I'm 
too busy and still too
disturbed, needing roots,
needing love, needing
new goals & a pattern in life.
I'll just try to learn to write a diary
