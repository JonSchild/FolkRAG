BJ   R. 2,   P. 14

[*4*]

AL:    Well, you mean the children that she beat?
BJ:  No, those [that] others that she didn't beat -- hers.  The others
was her stepchildren.  She married this man with these chulren, see?
[*child resentment*]
An' she treated 'em so bad...she really...I seen that done...We have
went in the woods and beat the devil out of her; we have killed her.
That's how we used to whup our parents, you know.  Whup Mama that
way, too.  Go out in the woods and kill'er.  An', an' bury 'em.
(That is, pretend to, using a tree stump for the victim.)  Come
back home laughin' and talkin'.  Take a stick, old log, old tree,
anythin' you want to; name it her, them; an' we stomp it, we beat it,
we call it everything we hear the grown folks say or we ever heard
anybody say, the nastiest word; we'd a-spit on it; we'd do everythin'
to it; name it them.  We'd bury it; we'd sing songs over 'em.  We'd
feel good about it.  On the say home, "We done killed 'em."  We used
to kill Miz Laurie -- the ol' stump, you know Miz Laurie's a big-sized
woman -- just kick 'er.  Oh, go'd and knock her.  Say, ["Here's]
Hit her in the head, there, Willie,hit 'er."  We'd kill 'er.  Kill
'er dead.  We'd get back home, we'd better act like we just nice chulren.
They come from home, catch us doin' that, oh my, they would've whipped
us to death.  Ha, ha.  Oh, we had done that more time when I'm little;
that's [my] our adventure; that's our joy we get.  But now the chulren's joy
is cussin' their parents right back to their face.  Yes, suh, they
tell what they want right now; just snap 'em up, y'see.  But in them
days we went off in the woods and tuk us a bush or tree or stump or
sumpin and got it out of that, and that was all right.  Peace and
happiness, too, 'cause I'd beat it to death.  I'd beat Mama; I'd take
her out and bury her; I'd break her laig, you know, when you take 
the think [*stick*] and break it up, break her laig; she can't walk.  Hu, hu, hu,
do it all kinda ways.  Well, you gotta get back home, y'know, in
time to eat, when it time to fo that you'd better be somewhere
around there -- playin' as happy as you can be.  She ain't know we
done killed her down there.  Wull, ha, ha, ha.  We used to kill Miz
Laurie the same way 'cause she treated them chulren so bad.  We'd
just kill 'em; drown 'em; put 'em in ol' muddy water where the cows
go through?  Yea, ha, ha.  Throw 'em out there and kill 'em (her).  Crazy
things; but it was good to us, though.  It was happy to us; we felt
like we had done sumpin'.  Big thing (Laurie); call her everything.
