Dear Mr. Spivacks:

Thank you so much for your letter of October 21st.  
I am grateful indeed to the Library of Congress for 
allowing me to use some of the records in your archives. 
These have now been received, and I shall be able to 
return them to you in a little while. 

I can give you this Corporation's promise that they
will not be used for any commercial purposes whatever. 
This Corporation is a non-commercial organization and it 
has no interest, and indeed constitutionally forbidden
to commercialize, its programs. 

The series which I am now preparing on American 
Negro music will, I know, have aver wide audience among 
British listeners. 

With kindest regards, 

Yours sincerely, 

Felix Greene
