[*30*]
                             SUNSHINE 'N' RAIN
                          A schoolteacher's song of instruction


CHORUS:    Sunshine 'n' rain,
                     We notice divided rain
                     The lighted face of love
                     With showers from above.
                     Sunshine 'n' rain,
                     We notice the glory in rain,
                     The subject is the sunshine 'n' the rain.

                    Would you care to see upon the fairest ground,
                    It helped to gather flowers, fruit 'n' grain.
                    (Fruit 'n' grain.)                                           (CHORUS)
