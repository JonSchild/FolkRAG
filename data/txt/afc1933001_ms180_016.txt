Dear Alan:

Thank you for your nice letter of March sixth. 
I, too, am sorry we did not have a chance to talk 
briefly when I was last in Washington.

I am forwarding your letter to George Allen, director 
of programs for WABC, with the strong recommendation 
that he consider one or another of your transcription 
series for his all-night schedule. 

I am sorry to say that we don't have any 15-minute 
spot to offer you on a sustaining basis right now. 
Why don't you have a talk with Dick Linkroum, a 
charming chap who is now program director of WJSV, 
and see whether you could work out some way of feeding 
a program from there to the network? You 
probably wouldn't make much or anything out of it, 
but anyhow you could keep your hand in.

Sincerely,
Dave
Davidson Taylor
