Dear Mr. MacLeisch:
An adult group in Charleston, West Virginia, has 
approached me with an expression of interest in folk music.
The members of the organization are endeavoring to develop 
a regular clearing house for community folk music on a 
permanent basis.
The leaders interested feel that there should be 
a survey of West Virginia in which may be found many remains 
of balladry and have suggested that I write you in the interest 
of sending Mr. Alan Lomax for as long a period as 
possible.  If at all within your convenience, Mr. Lomax
would be able to render very great service to this community
music project during the month of August.
Personally I assure you that the leaders are an 
enthusiastic group and doubtless will perform very excellent 
service in the preservation of much of the folk lore now 
recorded only in the minds of older men and women in this 
State.
Sincerely yours,
David Kirby
