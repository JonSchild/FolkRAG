Dear Mr Lomax
     Although unfortunately I missed your last television
broadcast I have seen several of yours and found them
most delightful, as I am very keen on folk-songs. In
a way I'm sorry you're going back to the U.S.A. although
I'm sure you'll collect a great many more treasures there,
and would like to take this opportunity of wishing you
God speed.
     I myself have done a little collecting of a type of
song which may interest you. Am mentioning the matter in
all humility, for it's quite likely that you have already
recorded thousands of my type of song! But in case
you haven't, here goes!
     Realising that most of the older English songs have been
collected by such men as Cecil Sharp, Vaughan Williams,
Frank Collinson, not to mention yourself, I realised a long
time ago that there would be no point in my trying to
collect any. Besides, where I live is far too civilised
(Derbyshire) and it would have meant travelling far afield,
which my circumstances and bad eyesight do not permit.
The only scope in my immediate vicinity would be in
collecting some of the lovely carols in Castleton (about
six miles from Grindleford) but many of these have already
been collected, and I'm told that Castletonians regard the
songs as their own private property and are very loth to
divulge them.
