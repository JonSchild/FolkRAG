distaste for the police and everything they represent.

one, feeling somewhat encouraged by their statement
that they recovered 95% of [the]stolen cars.  That

shot me [I] bolt upright in bed next morning

Below is a picture of the scene of the crime.

Burton Hall
Officer     60th St.     arch    Ellis Ave   ramp
    Park
--- = my wanderings through hall which (car, locked)
took with my visit to the desk clerk in the office
fifteen minutes.
The car was locked, windows up, doors locked, under
two brilliant street lamps on a busy street.
