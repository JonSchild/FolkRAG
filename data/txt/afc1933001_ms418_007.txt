THE WORKER'S CRY OF FREEDOM
(Tune--Marching Thru Georgia)

The men are in the factories sitting in strike we know
Holding down production so that we can get more dough
The Union's organizing and we'll see that it is so
Shouting the Union forever

Chorus;
Hurrah, Hurrah, The Union makes us free
Hurrah, Hurrah, It's all for you and me
Organize your brothers and we'll win the fight you'll see
Shouting the Union forever!

The women got together and they a farmed a mighty throng
Every worker's wife, and man and sister will belng
They will fight beside the men to help the cause al ong
Shouting the Union forever

Homer Martin is the leader of this mighty band,
And we'll stand behind [the men] him for the future of the
land
We won't give up the battle 'til we get our just demands
Shouting the Union forever

When the battle's over, and we're back to work once more,
There will not be a single scab inside the factory door
The men will wear their buttons and the bosses won't get 
sore
Shouting the Union forever
