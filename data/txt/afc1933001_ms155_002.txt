Dear Mr. Geer:

A group of young N. Y. A. part-time writers 
are engaged in research prior to writing an American 
pageant containg work songs. The pageant is to be 
based on American folk songs such as Share Cropper 
songs, negro songs, etc.

I believe Mr. Allan Lomax has recently compiled a 
large number of work songs. Would you be good enough 
to let me know how I can contact him.

Thank you very much for your cooperation in this 
matter.

Sincerely yours, 
Pierre Loving
