A PROPOSAL FOR A STUDY OF RUMORS IN THE UNITED STATES

Rumors are proven weapons of Axis propagandists and disloyal 
American groups.  The currency of rumors is directly related to unsatisfied 
needs for information.  Hence, rumor detection and counteraction 
are necessarily important concerns of OWI.

Ideally we would like to know everything about all current rumors 
and would want a continuing study of them.

However, because of 1) our limitations of staff and facilities; 
2) our need for intensive material on the subject if we are to deal 
effectively with rumor detection and counteraction, this proposal is 
merely for a single preliminary study of rumors dealing, intensively, 
with a specific subject (such as rationing) and supplementarily, with 
others for the purposes of comparison.
