AMERICAN FOLK-SONG AND THE EDUCATOR
   "A community or a nation that endures for a time becomes
corporate, acquires a collective heart and a collective
mind.  In its folk songs, as in its folk-lore, its
traditions and customs, the collective heart and mind
receive expression and find embodiment.  All that is
narrowly individual is lost from such expressions before
they find place in the communal heritage, and in
consequence they acquire a simplicity, sincerity, and
power that only a distillate of the thought and feeling
of thousands can possess.  No individual art-expressions,
except for the loftiest that spring from the greatest
geniuses, can match folk-expressions in these
respects.
   "Since folk songs reflect the essential states of feeling
that have pervaded a people, they are the natural food
for the spirits of the heirs of that people.  The masters
of music have left an incredibly rich legacy which waits
for us as we come of age:  but for our youth no legacy
surpasses that of the folk-songs of our people.  Not all
of them:  for while all have the tang, the salt of reality,
only those that reflect the best moments of such vital\
human experience are worthy of the young.  It speaks
well of the souls of people that such pure and beautiful
songs abound in countless numbers."
