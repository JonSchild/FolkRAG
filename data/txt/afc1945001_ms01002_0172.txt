MEMORANDUM

TO:                   Mr. DuBois

FROM :             R. Keith Kane

             Thanks for your memorandum on the Seattle Legion
Post Rumor Clinic.

            What are the clinics which you know are established?

             Is the Harvard Clinic cooperating with the Boston
Traveller, which I understand is publishing a Rumor Clinic?

            When do you expect to know whether we can have the
flow of rumors from the clinics?
