Dear Mr. Lomax,
I am told that you might be interested
 in my songs and so am writing in hopes that we 
may meet sometime.
I specialize in foreign songs with my 
guitar and last year was in Jugoslavia and 
brought back some delightful ones from there.
I have already done sound and television 
broadcasting but am really too nervous to do a 
good performance on my own, so I no longer seek 
work with the B.B.C. but confine myself to 
private party entertaining. Your informal 
singing circles would however be just the thing 
for my temperament.
Yours truly,
Eric F. Lukis
