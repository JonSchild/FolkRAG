Dear Sirs:
            
This acknowledges with thanks the receipt of ten
phonograph records of Mexican folk songs sent to me by express
prepaid.
          
I have played the records and found them to be in
good condition. 
         
Again I thank you very much and assure you of my 
cooperation in further work that you may want to do in this
part of the country. 

Sincerely  yours, 

JARickard
