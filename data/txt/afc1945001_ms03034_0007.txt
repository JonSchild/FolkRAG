discussed the problem with Dr. Dublin and others in New York. There was some fear about the study, lest the data unless adequately controlled for age, occupation, and dependency, be misleading. Nevertheless, Mrs. Robison thinks that there is a good chance that at least one pilot study will be made. This, you understand, is entirely unofficial, and does not involve the War Department. Dr. Jaffe talked with Mrs. Robison about it as an old friend. As you know, it is not our function to make studies outside of the Army. If something comes of this initial move, it is quite likely OFF might be interested in following up and that it might fall well within your province to take the responsibility yourself for such a study or a better designed one. Possibly it would be good if you, Dubois, Cottrell, Likert or someone else from your staff could talk with Dr. Robison (Republic 7500, Ex. 4285). 
I was happy to attend your staff meeting Tuesday and sincerely appreciate the opportunity of keeping in close contact with you. 
Sincerely yours,
