Elmo Newcomer's Dance Calls
and Fiddle tune words

Cottoneyed Joe--

Hold my fiddle and hold my bow
And knock the devil outa Cotton Eye Joe.
Ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo etc.
I'd a got married twenty year ago,
Had it not been for Cotton Eye Joe.
Oooh-oo----
I'd a got married six or seven year ago,
Had it not been for that little word No.

Some folks say that a Nigger won't steal
But I found three in my cornfield.
One had a bushel and one had a peck,
And one had a roas'n-ear around his neck.

Rawhide fiddle and cornstalk bow,
Look out over there for Cotton Eye Joe.
How in the world do the old folk know
That I take sugar in my coffee, oh?
Longtailed buck an' a short-tailed doe,
But I take sugar in my coffee, oh.
OOh-oo-oo etc

Mabel--(Schottische)

Love it is an awful thing, beauty is a blossom;
And if you want your finger bit, just stick it at a possum.

Glory to the meetin'-house, and glory to the steeple (stable?)
Tlory to the little girl that they call Mabel/

Turkey in the Straw-

Went out to milk and didn't know how,
I milked a goat instead of a cow.

Saw a turkey settin' on a pile o' straw,
Winkin' at his mother-in-law.

I went out to milk an' i don't know how, 
I milked a goat inatid of a cow.

Picked up a rock and whacked him on the jaw,
And he kicked up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

Fortunate Puppy-

Why can't a white man dance like a Nigger,
Oh, just because he can't cut a figger.
Doggone a rye-straw, doggone a riddle, oh,
Doggone am little boy playin' on a fiddle, oh.

Blue-eyed Susy-

Sometimes drunk, sometimes woozy, sometimes dance with my blue-eyed Susy
Love my wife, love my baby, and I love them flapjacks floatin' in gravy.
All I want to make me happy is two little boys to call me Pappy.
One named Dick, the other named Davy; Come to your Daddy, you pore little baby.
