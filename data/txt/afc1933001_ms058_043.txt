Livingston, Ala.,
May 30, 1939.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

The necessity of wiring you
for more records to be hurried to
Raiford, Fla. was a surprise also to 
me. I was sorry to disturb
the even flow of affairs for you
in true Lomaxian style. But
this section is rich in fresh
material which I can't resist.
I used more stuff than I
had counted on.

This afternoon we move
on to Florida. From there to Clemson,
S.C., to record some white
spiritual singing said to be quite
unusual. Then on to Murrell's
Inlet, S.C. and on to Washington.
