The reason we named this book "Our Singing Country" --
using the present participle -- is that the collection
represents something which is alive in American today,
alive and growing. In the first place almost every song in
the book was recorded between 1933 and 1939 from people
who are still singing the songs of their foreparents, making
new songs, and passing them on to others, vigorous, strong-
minded, independent Americans who like what they like, who
like their own music generally better than anything they are
taught or that they have pushed at them from commercial
sources.
