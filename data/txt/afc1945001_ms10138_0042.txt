I think this war is caused due to selfishness
Hitler is pretending to be in a nervous state
of mind. He is weakening. I don't think it
is his mind but it's the lack of brains. The
United States, I hope, will never give up
but fight to the finish. Hitler is wanting
just that because after all he is running
short on men and wants a chance to build
another army to come back at the United
States just as the Japs did at Pearl Harber on
Dec. 7, 1941. I wish I could be on the front
with the soldiers. I don't mean walking up and
down the street in front of the house but on
the battle front. What I would give to get a
strike at the japs and Nazis is  not imaginable
We will fight or die. We lose some but 
what do the enemys gain. Nothing, and
never shall they get into America unless
it's through immagration.
