[gas grown and bustling] [mushroomed in] [with the oil boom.]

My papa was rentin' over in Lou's'ana when he got married. [Den] He moved
to Texas an' went in on halvers wid a colored man an' dey had
some trouble an' papa had to beat de man up pretty bad so he move
down an' rent from ol' man Henry Simms, what owned three of
fo' thousan' acres near Caddo lake.Ol' man Simms was a noble 
ol' colored [seller] man. He liked my papa an' 'gin him
de bes' en' o' ev'ything. When I was 'bout ten, [my] papa
bought sixty-eight# acres lan' f'om ol' Dr. Waskom in Boulder*,
Texas. Dis lan' was near Caddo Lake , some of it hill an'
some of it lake level, but de hill was as good as de lake.
Dat year, after he had laid by his crop in ol' man Simms place, my papa
went over an' cleared up 'nough lan' for a crop on his new farm.
An' ev'y year [atter dat] he kep' on clearin' lan'. He'd be
out 'til one, two 'clock in de mawnin', him an' mama, wid
us two chillun** sleep at de house, burnin' brush an' cuttin' trees.
Sometime I'd wake up at night way late an' watch de fire burnin' ['way]
off dere in de bottom. Yassuh, my papa he was a wuckah. I reckon
I got it from him to be such a good worker in de penitenshuh." [*?*]

murder charge, he had fifty-five acres of land left.

a Waskom, La., where L.B. used after to play for dances
