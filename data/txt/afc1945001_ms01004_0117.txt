Dear Dr. Horowitz:

            Just a line to explain that the
designation "Confidential" on our documents
is due to the fact that they are based on
the "Daily Digest of Foreign Broadcasts"
published on behalf of the British Ministry
of Information by the British Broadcasting
Corporation, and that this document in turn
is classified as confidential.

                                         Yours sincerely,

                                                         Ernst Kris.
