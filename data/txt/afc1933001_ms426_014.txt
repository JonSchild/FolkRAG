FARMER'S UNION FLAG

Tune--Carolina Moon.

Farmer's Union flag keep waving,
Lead your army on to victory.
Farms and homes are worth the saving,
Yours the task is given to set men free.
Buckle your belt up tight,
Swing in because you're right,
Banish this Agriculture plight,
Farmer's Union flag keep waving.
Lead your army on to victory.

Farmer's Union bugles blowing,
Calling for a host of volunteers.
Faith and hope in hearts are glowing,
Lifting us above the front line fears.
Pull up your saddle girt,
Lay on that leather squirt,
Dare you with cold, grim death to flirt.
Farmer's Union flag keep waving,
Lead your army on to victory.

THE GOOD OLD UNION WAY

Tune--The Good Old Summer Time.

In the good old Union way,
In the good old Union way,
O'er the hills and down the lanes on the meeting day.
We crank our Ford and twist her tail,
And bumpty-bump as we sail,
To hear what others have to say
'Bout the good old Union way.

On that good old Union night,
On that good old Union night,
Dad gets up to make his speech, what an awful sight!
His lips get thick, his throat gets full,
His coat he starts to pull.
He sits down from chagrin and fright,
On that good old Union night.

In the good old Union style,
In the good old Union style,
Coffee, cake and doughnuts too stacked up in a pile.
We drink and laugh, some business do,
And when the evening is through,
It's after midnight quite a while,
It's the good old union style.
