Dear Harold,

I am now beginning to gather certain new material I
need for the book I shall write under my Guggenheim Fellowship.
I missed the chance at some wonderful records last week end.
And things will be coming along now all the time that will be worth
taking down. I hope you all can still lend me a good machine.

Mrs. Jacobson can use the machine in between times
to record her excellent Czech informants. I still consider her the
best field worker I have ever met.

Later on next year I'm going South for additional
stuff I'll need for the book... I do not yet have the money to
order the records I will need from the Archive for this book,
but I hope to have it within the month.

The Town hall series, a leaflet of which is attached,
got off to a flying start last night. Sold out house, and wonderful
music. We're going to bring in singers from all over the country,
eventually, if things keep going well. If you like, you can have
all these sessions recorded for thirty dollars per evening. They're
going to be worth keeping.

Decca albums are at last in the works. It has taken,
in the end, a very heavy job of selling the project to the man who
conceived it--- Mr. Jack Kapp.

People's Songs is growing very rapidly and healthily.
In a couple of years you will see it as a big, national organization.
10,000 members and a whole new repertory of songs and flocks of
singers.

Let me hear from you anent this request at your earliest.

Alan
