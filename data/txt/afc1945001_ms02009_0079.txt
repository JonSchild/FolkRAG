As has been previously pointed out, the most dangerous rumors
to handle are hate-rumors. The technique recommended by the Office of

"The British are getting rich on the war."
"Big Business is getting rich on the war."
"Labor is getting rich on the war."
"Farmers are getting rich on the war."
"Catholics are getting rich on the war."
"Jews are getting rich on the war."
"Baptists are getting rich on the war."
"Stalin is getting rich on the war." etc.
Such a barrage demonstrates, by its very inclusiveness, that this
is a common kind of rumor, indiscriminately applied; that the particular rumor
is just another version of another rumor; and that all rumors of this character
are to be mistrusted. Listing hate-rumors about different groups en masse
helps to expose the basic strategy and fallacy of hate-rumors.

minority groups in the community; technical experts (from the psychology or
sociology department of local colleges or universities), professional social
