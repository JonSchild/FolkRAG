"Sure I was down in Chariton and the guy there could get me new tires
for $50 a pair. The way he did it was to park his car up town with a set of new
tires on it and some salesman would come along and comment on the tires and the
guy would say, 'sure they have only about 200 miles on them -- I'll sell you a
couple for $50.' He said he had sold four pair that way in the last week."
