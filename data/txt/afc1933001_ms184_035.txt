Dear Alan:

Your letter from Nashville arrived while I was away from the office
on a short vacation and has just come to my attention. I must confess
that I was quite surprised at its hysterical tone. There was little in
my previous letter to lend you to jump to so many conclusions.

Although it is true that no specific allotment has been made for
folk song recording during the coming fiscal year, I have worked out an
arrangement with the administration whereby we may make recommendations
against the Librarian's fund for specific projects. It goes without saying 
that during this war we must change our basic policy. I am against any
"business as usual" policy and I am sure that you feel the same way. I am
perfectly willing to recommend folk song recording expeditions which are
directly connected with the war efforts and I feel quite sure that we can
obtain the necessary funds for this type of work.

The records you made of the soldiers singing in our Auditorium has been
well received by the Army and we are proceeding with this part of the Pro-
ject. I expect this to lend to a much larger Project in due time but any
attempt to push this disorganized movement will only lead to disaster later.

By Latin American project I presume you refer to the appropriation for
the Inter-Departmental Committee. There has been the usual delays here and
poor Mr. Chase has not yet received his salary for this month. We just re-
ceived a letter, however, stating that we will get our money in due time
and this is to include the projects we asked for for albums of folk music
records and recording in Latin America. So you see you have no right to
jump to that conclusion either.

As I wrote you before, the USO is still very much interested in folk
song work but we must not expect things to be organized over night. Every-
body is terrifically bushy and with the best of intentions can just do so much 
work in one day.

All I can say then in summing up is that if you have any projects in
mind which are directly connected with the war effort either within the Army
