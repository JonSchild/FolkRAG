Miss Nell Farrar, Superintendent
Vocational School for Girls
Tullahoma, Tennessee

My dear Miss Farrar:
    On December 12, 1934, you very kindly sent
me a group of songs that was sung by the girls of
your institution. Included in these songs was one
entitled, "Among the Little White Daises". I enclose
a copy of this song. I wonder if it would be possi-
ble for you to get someone to write down the music
of this song as it is known in the Vocational School.
I should very much appreciate hearing from you with
a copy of the tune.

    Sincerely yours,
    Honorary Consultant and Curator
    Archive of American Folk-Song
