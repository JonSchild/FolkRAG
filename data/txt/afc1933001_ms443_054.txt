Jump down, turn aroun',
Pick a bale o' cotton,
Jump down, turn aroun',
Pick a bale a day.

O Julie,
Pick a bale o' cotton, 
O Julie,
Pick a bale a day.

Me an' my wife can pick a bale o' cotton,
Me an' my wife can pick a bale a day.

O Julie,
Pick a bale o' cooton,
O Julie,
Pick a bale a day.

Me an' my wigy can pick a bale a cotton,
Me an' my wify can pick a bale a day.

Jump down, turn aroun', pick a bale a cotton,
Jump down, turn aroun', pick a bale a day.

Waht's de matter,

Old lady,

Looky looky yonder,

Jump down, turn around,
