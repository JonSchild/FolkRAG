the quilts 'cause I was gonna have a baby y'see. That would be allowed to
help the mama. But he, he was goin' give Betty the money to destroy
[the] this chile that I would go with him. He's a married man with chilrun,
he was white - just about white. His father was white and his mother real
light, and he run big [(cough here)] plantation, his father owned 'im . [(Man] Ol' Man
[Bessie -?-)] Best owned 'im. He's a white man, but he owned 'im. He owned
Cozza (?) (kozzack). He still livin'; I heard about him not long ago.
AL:     What do you mean, he owned him?
BJ:     He owned 'him. He didn't disown him, Ol' Man Best. He owned him and Cozza
went by the name of Clark [*mother's name 'cause Old Man Best was white*], but he's Old Man Best's son. Old Man Best
gave him a plantation. You see? After he married an' everything.
 He still got it. Ol' Man Bes' died, an' the other whites didn'
like it, but he give it to 'im. You could see Cozza was his
chile. Well, anyhow, Cozza wanted Betty to destroy this
child, in me, that he would get me. You see, I was...I reckon...
a lil' gal o' his type, I reckon...he thought. An' I didn'
have no idea, he never said to me in his life. But they plan
that between one another. Betty was a woman of that type.
"Le's get rid of this this chile (whispered here)?" You see.
They go...an' Betty would give me...got some medicin for me,
to take. An' I didn't [know] notice that. Didn't know [who] What['s] it was
[it] for an' Nothin'. (Cresha) 'cause she - quick she come and sneak me from Mama, to 
he'p her quilt some, that I would have quilts. Mama say, "All
right; she can help you piece up some quilts. (They let me
stay a day or two, 'cause they didn't let me) stoopin' around doin'
a whole lot of work, now. (Since I'm not so well (?) find out sumpin' ill!), know?
[*tried to kill unborn child*]
So (half a day--someone's name--?), the white people.
They was up there, too, you know, 'cause they didn't want me
to do nothin' but they wanted me to do what they liked to do.
An' so...that was a good thing...I went down to Betty's. The
first night I was there, I felt funny. Jus' something [I had] gonna happen...
when I have that feelin'; I has it now, sometime. I felt curious, I had a curious feelin'.
There's sumpin' gonna happen; I didn't know what it was. I's 
playin' with a puzzle in the fireplace, settin' on the floor.
This man come in, but I didn't know what it was. I knowed 
him 'cause he stayed at our [place] frolics. Mama, mama used to give
parties...[parties] frolics. I seen 'im there. He about your size
(6 ft.), now. And he really white. He come in there an'
