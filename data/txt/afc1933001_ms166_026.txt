Mr. Willard Z. Park
University of Oklahoma
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

Dear Mr. Park:

Would you be willing to undertake the co-sponsorship of
Miss Barry's project with us. It's the sort of job that should
have constant supervision by a technically qualified person. If
you should feel able to do this, I think we could furnish Mrs. Barry
with the equipment she wishes. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
