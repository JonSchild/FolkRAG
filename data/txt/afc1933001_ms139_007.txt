Washington, D.C.

Dear Miss West:

It is difficult to sent you the "correct
words" of your "ghost story" since this song is,
like so many folksongs, current in a number of
different versions. However, I can give you a
reference to published versions of the song and
you can choose the one you like the best.

Page 483, Folk Songs of the South John
Harrington Cox, Harvard University Press, 1925.

In this source you will find references to
other versions, both English and American.

Sincerely yours,
