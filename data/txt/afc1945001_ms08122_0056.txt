A Rumor
A lady wasn't able to go to the 
ration board for her ration books. She
wrote a letter to the ration board asking
them to mail the ration books to her.
She received a letter from the ration
board shortly after she mailed her letter
to them.  Enclosed in the envelope was
a clothes ration book. If they had
clothes ration books all printed and
ready, that ment the government was
going to ration clothes.
