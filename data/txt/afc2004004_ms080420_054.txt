it this afternoon.  I want you to stand on your feet, right now,
if you would.  Let's place another flower, if we can do it. [like we've been doing.]
Maybe your dad or your mother are here, if they are, put your arm
around their neck.  It's a homecoming.  I want to thank you for
every dish you ever baked for me, every time that you turned my bed
down.  Every time you put a wet wash cloth on my head when fever
was so high, I'd like to thank you [for] today for it.  I'm going to
[gibe] give a flower and it's not growing in the earth, but it's growing
in my heart.  I love you from the deep of my heart.  If I don't have
you at this homecoming here, I'll meet you at the great homecoming
of tomorrow.  I felt them glory bumbs [one] once again.  Just slip
out of your seat, and go.  Put your arm around mom or dad, or wife
or husband, whatever the case might be and say 'I love you from the
deep of my heart.'  I promise you this afternoon, I'll meet you where
the wires will never fail.  Listen to the words.

(SECTION ENDS)
MAN #2:  I wasn't saved by feeling, but I'm glad that when we're
saved by faith that there's a feeling and an assurance that goes along
with it.  God said that the just shall live by faith.  Thank God.
And it says that we travel by faith and not by sight.  I'm glad it
seems that down in our hearts that every so often we get insight.
We do apprecate your having come today, now.  We want you to continue
to pray.  We're going to ask Joe and the singers from over at Maggie
Valley if they'll come back and sing some more for us.  And just continue
to enjoy the Lord, enjoy his spirit and his goodness.  Continue to
pray.  We appreciate this good spirit today.  Ask Joe if he'll come back.
