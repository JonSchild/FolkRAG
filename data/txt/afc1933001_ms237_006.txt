I'm glad and gratified to hear 
that I'm pleasantly remembered by 
your associates. Especially Phil 
and Jerry and Johnny are tops.
And I ought to include those 
two girl secretaries. In leaving

be fair and not forget that 
the chief was your friend when 
you needed a friend and that 
he has often stood and defended 
you when others criticized
your freedom and a 
chance to earn an[d] extra 
dollar. And don't allow your own
