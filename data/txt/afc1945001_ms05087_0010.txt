Nutley, N. J., August 6, 1942

"The Nazis are trying to gain control of the oil fields in Russia, and
if they succeed we will have a long and hard war, for Japan will attack
us on the west coast and the Nazis will come at us on the east coast.
If we can stop the Nazis from gaining the oil wells in Russia, the war
will be over before the end of 1942."   (70)
