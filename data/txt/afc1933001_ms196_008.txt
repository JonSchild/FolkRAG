Mr. Duncan Emerich
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Duncan:

Attached is my check for the records you so
kindly sent me.  I keep hearing from many sources about
what a good job you're doing at the Library of Congress,
and, believe me, I'm most happy that things go well and
that you're there and I'm here.

I very much need to have the new Library of
Congress albums.  In my day, it was the practice of the
Archive to send single copies of records to the recordists
when pressings were issued.  Perhaps this policy
does not continue.  Dr. Spivacke was kind enough to
present me with the sets edited by Botkin, in view of
my long years of association with the Archive.  Naturally,
since a full set of your new albums would come to a
pretty figure, I would very much like for this kindness
to be continued.

I would certainly be able to use the records
and, to some extent, to advertise them on my Mutual
program.

Would you be kind enough to let me know what
the Library's reaction is to this request?

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
