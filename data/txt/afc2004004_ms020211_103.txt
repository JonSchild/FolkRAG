Dear Bessie:

The Newport Foundation is planning a series of concerts and would
like very much to have you and the Georgia Sea Island Singers
appear.  There will be on concert in New York, one in Philadelphia,
and one in Boston, all in the same weekend of February 12th, 1965.

We would like you to come up at least two days beforehand because
we would really like to show the group to its best advantage.  Alan
[* cc: *] Lomax would like to work out the programming with you.  Also, if 
it is agreeable to you we will try to arrange other bookings for
you.  So you should let me know if you have time available the week
before and the week after the concerts.

The fee per concert is $75.00 per person and $100.00 for the leader,
that will be a total of $400.00 per concert for the group of yourself, 
Peter Davis, John Davis, Emma Ramsey and Mable Hillary.  As
soon as I hear from you I will contact Ed Young in Memphis to see
if he can join you.  We would like to know as quickly as possible.
I would appreciate your telephoning me as soon as you know if you
are all free to come.

Telephone me collect, day or night at area code 212, telephone
number TRafalgar 3-0733.  I look forward to speaking with you
shortly.  Best wishes for the holiday season.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Joyce Wein
