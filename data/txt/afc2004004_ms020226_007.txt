make ya --  An' then 'tween that, ya get in sumpthin' else!
Ya see?   Ya got -- ya got to have sumpin' to, to look at or to
do sumpin'.   Ya have your radio.   An' ya need a television if
ya ain't got any, ya need one.  An' ah, an' ah, just a heap a 
things.  Ya got to cover up; ya got to wash your face an' han's;
ya got to wear clo'es; ya got [to do] everything. Especially a
woman, she be by herself if she want to, she need everything.
She need every thing, jus' like she would if she had a husban'.
You got to be clean an' you got to keep your house clean an' you
got to -- An', an' if you's a church person, you got to fix up
the place; you got to go among peoples an' people an' the people 
got to come 'mong you.  So, therefore, it takes so many things
to get in debt for, many things.  Yeah, yessir.

Then also we has the church to pay for, an' I has to he'p
do that.   An' so, jus' many things, many things.  Many times I 
be buy things for the church to sell an', an' ah, many times we
don't get it sold out.   But that money jus' mostly gone, see?
But we mostly buy from one another now. We made up a plan to buy
from one another, to give out. [So] If nobody don't come an' buy
ya out. We jus' buy from one another, ya un'erstand?  To keep it 
goin'.

So, anyway, there's jus' so many things to be in debt for,
so many things.  An' ah, an' sickness, I [had] ain' had no sickness,
I can thank God.  You know, to get in debt for, ya know.

TL:    What kind of selling back and forth to one another do you
do?  Household things?
BJ:     No, no. no, no.   Ah, just say, if I buy somethin' tonight to sell.
You know, like a a whole lot of hamburger or a whole lot of fish,
an' ah, an' bread an' diffrunt things with it, an' I don't sell
