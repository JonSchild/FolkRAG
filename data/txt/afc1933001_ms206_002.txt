Adv. JAL- Letter of Alan Lomax to JAL-
Chicago- Spring 1934
Wednesday night
Dear Father,- Sad news, very---Last night driving, a little lonely, to Burton Hall,
I parked the car in front of that grey collegiate Gothic pile and went inside
to see the room clerk.  Fifteen minutes later, after some wandering through dark
courts and pa sage ways, I came out and for my v lises and found the Ford was gone. [R]
Thinking that I had absentmindedly forgotten where it was parked, I raced round
the block.  Still no muddy little For d. I called the police, gave a querulous w
woman the description, license number, etc., and bade [them] her send them out to
the radio police cruisers.  Then down to the police station I urged on a slow
taxi.  The sergeant was slow, Irish, delib rate, and had a form to fill out that
included everything but my church affiliation.  How I managed to keep my manners
in my impatience is a wonder to me, especially with my instinctive distaste for
the police and everything they repr sent.  Nevertheless, I got to bed and to sleep
by one, feeling somewhat encouraged by their statement that they recovered 95 % of
the stolen cars.  That night through until an electric alarm shot me [through]
bolt upright in bed next morning, I dreamed of auto thieves and battles and absurd
errors of mine.
Let me now review the circumstances of the theft.  Below is a picture of 
the scene…..  The car was locked, windows up, doors locked, under two brilliant
street lamps on a busy street.  The next morning the police called, said the car
had been recovered, asked me to come to the police station down in the Loop.  So
overjoyed was I t the news, having imagined, of course, our whole next year spoiled
by the car’s loss, that I dressed in five minutes, forgot breakfast and was off at
a run.  The men looked me over, thought I was all right, gave me the pawn ticket,
directed me to Sheridan’s garage to which the car had been hauled.  Ten miles away
it was and by street car an hour and a half ride.  The proprietor, Whom re Lincoln
Steffens I suspected of conivance and getting a cut in the racket, was a wiry, tough
young Irishman.  He was very sympathetic, sh owed me how the thieves has used a master
key to get in the door, a penny to start the ignition, twirled the wheel and broke
