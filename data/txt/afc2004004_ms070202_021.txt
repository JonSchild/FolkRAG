We knew a houngan at Commendadore - 
1) Cow lost for 3 months, his company of
marines scoured the country. Houngan
said he could find him. Came, shut
all windows & doors, two candles on 
a table, book (size of small dict) tied to
a long iron key by a string - houngan
held one end, I the other. The book began
to turn after chants. All right cow back
before five days. 3 days later little
boy "the cow, the cow" - cow came
running down the road as if devil
behind her as if been running miles
