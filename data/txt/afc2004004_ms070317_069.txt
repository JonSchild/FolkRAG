A Michigan song from
Flat River & Locksley's Camp

I worked for Mike Roach & Mike Lenan,
Bull-whip Bob (Clark) and the bull-dog man; (Patty Harris)

T.R. Bobbet would be my name
If I would stand old Mary Anne
(T.R.'s wife who
ran the camp & worked over the men)

The Hobo's Lament
The IC's been better to the [?] than any road
in the South

Texas Is Too Dry for Hell
