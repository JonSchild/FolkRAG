Dear Alan: Should my trip to Washington
ever be authorized I hope you
will send me any possible lead
that promises good material. I have
worn out my welcome at penitentiaries
and thus far I have found no traces
of gangs on levees or railroads.
I feel sure that I can of myself
justify the trip by the stuff I bring in.
But you can help, too.

1. I have written to Dr. Davis at
Galax as you suggest.
2. After the letter you showed me
from Aunt Molly I am surprised
that you ever had further dealings with
her. Any release you get from
her should be prepared by Macmillan
