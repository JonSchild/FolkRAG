all right - its not very funny - well, it isn't. So.

Anyway - if that much of the idea has any sparkle for you,
while in one of your more tolerant moods ( say I protecting
myself) why, have at it and drop me a line abou it - also
what defensing is going to mean in your life for the next few
months. 

And keerist - but I hopeyou're not carrying that damned
money order around in an already overloaded pocket.

Very much love to you both - ( excuse me, Corey - you too).

Thanks

Damnit! The "night school" frame looked as
though it would work out perfectly and be a 
logical frame for saying anything we'd like
to say and singing anything we'd like to sing -
but it doesn't work out to something, as yet.
