On my most recent trip to Camber, Wyoming, Helena, Montana and 
Boise, Idaho I had occasion to listen to a number of conversations 
concerning the war while on Pullman trains and in hotel lobbies. I 
listened to one person who seemed to indicate that he knew something 
about the subject upon which he spoke and it was to the effect that 
the War Department was very lax in the allocation and assignment of 
troops and special training after such troops had been inducted into 
the Army. Specifically he stated that he had a brother who was 
inducted into the Army and at the time of such induction advised his 
superior officers that he was an expert on skis and preferred to be 
assigned to the ski troops but instead he was assigned to the tank 
corps and that he learned that the Army was picking men for ski 
troops who had no experience whatever on skis.
