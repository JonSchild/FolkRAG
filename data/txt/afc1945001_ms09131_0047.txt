1. I heard the other day that Hitler hadn't
had a bath for some days. Another 
replied that one shouldn't worry; he
will be all washed up soon.
2. There was at one time in this war a
little Russian boy, who volunteered
to lead a German division to a
certain town. He led them right
into a nest of Russians.
3. I have heard numerous stories about the
underground movement in Belgium,
France, & Germany.
4. Two years ago I heard that some one
in this country had received a letter
from someone within Germany. The letter
inside said to save the
stamp. The recipient of the letter
took the stamp off & found written
beneath it - We are starving.
