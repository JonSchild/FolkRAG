Another business man who both contacts and is contacted by a large
number of sales people was very reluctant to impart information regarding
what he termed, "A terrible rumor". He said he had heard this rumor from
"two" different sources, but he himself had never repeated it. However,
when told it was for a report to "get at the bottom of such malicious propaganda
and prevent further spread of misinformation" he consented to tell
me what he had heard.
He said, "In two different instances I have heard references made
to the possibility of the Government 'writing-off' its obligations represented
by the War Bonds and crediting the individuals with whatever amount
was involved as their patriotic contribution to the 'all-out' effort."
He feels very emphatically that, "Something should be done to neutralize
the effect of such rumors and reassure the public of the stability of
the Bonds." Cleveland, Ohio 8-7-42 18
