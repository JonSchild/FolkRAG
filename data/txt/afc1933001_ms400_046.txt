Chain Gang Negroes          Page Three

slip away into the woods when the men are building a road through a dense
forest. Today, as you see, it is raining. We have them inside shelling peas."

And that is what they were doing - shelling garden peas for the cannery.
There were hogsheads full of fresh green peas for canning, and a lot of convicts,
still wearing road chains, seated around a long table tearing off the
soft green pods as the rain poured outside.

"But what is Chain gang?" I asked this specific question of a penitentiary
warden. "Is it a group of convicts chained together?"

"Hell, no," he said, "how could men get any work done all chained together?
These men must do an honest day's work, impossible if their bodies
did not have free play. A chain gang, as you hear the term used, means only
a group of convicts working on the road or elsewhere outside of the Penitentiary
walls. It is a group that unhappily arouses a lot of prejudice and
much misdirected and maudlin sympathy. Chain gang workers are freer, healthier
and happier than those that live inside the walls. You never find one
who does not prefer road work or farm work."

In visiting the Negro convicts of the nine Southern States, I discovered
many other things new to me. I travelled as the special guest of the
Governor of each State and with commendation of the Chief Executive of my
own State, Texas. I carried a machine to record for the Library of Congress
the Negro songs of each State, I was making no investigation of what I saw -
the conditions under which the men and women lived, their food and care, their
treatment at the hands of the guards, etc. But I could not fail to get many
impressions, all the more vivid because until I made this trip, I had never
seen a penitentiary or been inside a jail. Naturally, then, I had many surprising
experiences with the more than 20,000 black men and women I visited.
