4) "It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing,*
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay;
First to the dram-house and then to the card-house;
Got shot in the breast and I am dying today.
6) "Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin; +
Get six pretty maidens to bear up my pall.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.
7) "Then swing your rope slowly and rattle your spurs lowly,
And give a wild whoop as you carry me along;
And in the grave throw me and roll the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.
Oh bury me beside my knife and six-shooter,*
My spurs on my heel, my rifle by my side,
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.
"Go bring me a cup, a cup of cold water,
To cool my parched lips," the cowboy then said;
Before I returned his soul had departed,
And gone to the round-up -- the cowboy was dead.
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly,
And bitterly wept as we bore him along;
for we all loved our comrade, so brave, young, and 
handsome,
We all loved our comrade although he'd done wrong.
*Another version runs: 
It was once in saddle I used to look handsome,
It was once in the saddle I used to go gay,
First took to drinking and then took to gambling,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.
+ Two parallel stanzas: 
Get six jolly fellows to carry my coffin,
And six pretty maidens to bear up my pall,
And give to each of them bunches of roses
That they may not smell me as they bear me along.
Over my coffin put handfuls of lavender,
Handfuls of lavender on every side;
Bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Saying, "There goes a cowboy cut down in his pride."
*A variant stanza from the late lamented ballad collector, Professor  Shearin:
