Raised on six-shooters till I get big enough to eat ground shotguns, 
When I'm cool I warm the Gulf of Mexico and bathe therein,
When I'm hot there's an equinoxical breeze that fans me fevered brow,
The moans of widows and orphans is music to me melancholy soul.

Thirty-two inches 'tween the eyes and they feed me with a shovel,
Mount the wild ass and leap from crag to crag,
And roar like laughter in a tomb,

Gimme one hundred yards start and I'll run plumb to Honolulu without even wetting my feet,
Shoulder five hundred bushel of shot and wade through solid rocks up to my shoulder blades.

Snatch him bald-headed and spit on the place where the hair come off;
Take a lag off him and beat him over the head with the bloody end of it,
Slap his head up to a peak and then knock the peak off,
Take his eye out and eat it for a grape.

I'm the boy-----
