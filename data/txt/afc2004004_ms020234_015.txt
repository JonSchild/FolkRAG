BJ TAPE 20, p. 12

say a person die with no family at all?  You know, it seems very
dead, ha, to me.   So's the same way by the records an' by the
books an' things.   Even if I die, I be yet alive.   Well, I long
to be that way.  I reckon because I was born one, maybe.  You
know, ain't had no sisters, no brothers.
         An' I got that --- I don' know, it's jus' sumpthin' about me.
I got that feelin' like Christ, ya know?   Ah, as though I was 
gone, but yet I'm alive.  You see?  That's [what] way I feel like, about
myself, ya see?  I always have that in mind.  Said [He,] He, He was
by his self, one man.  You know, one child.  Or just say one child,
ya know.  'Cause Mary -- Those, those other children that, that
Joseph had they was[n't] somebody else's; they wasn't Mary's own.
Well, see, Jesus's gone, but he yet...But yet here.  An' so that's
the way I always had my mind.  I wanted to be yet here, see, an'
so [that's,] that's, that's what I did' I longed for that, [you now?]
an [Lawd] most...that, that was my heart desire, however.  You
know, to be yet here in, in chirruns an' in doin' an' in everything.
But yet it be somethin' worthwhile.
         I often sometimes listen to the blues?  Ya know, records?
Diffrunt ones, singin'?   [An so] I said, "Now, that's, that was his father,
ya know?   An' he servin' 'im.  He yet [gonna d-die] alive with, with his 
father.  But I wanna be alive with my father!  Ya know.  I mean
God.  Ya see?   Because, ah, if ya not the chirrun of God, ya the
children of the devil, see.   An' that's all to that.   An' that
make ya -- You be servin' your father.  If they can stretch out
the devil across the waters, I oughta stretch out God across the
waters!   You know, Christ; that's what I wanta do, [but] an' be yet alive
in it.
