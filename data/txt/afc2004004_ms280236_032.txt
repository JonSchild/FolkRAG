Lomax: You told me a story about a man who -- a woman that
missed her husband.
Robts: Oh, well, yes. Yes, well, his father had done
himself in in the same way. One night, the son, who
by that time was grown into manhood and married,
he was missing. So he didn't come in to tea, and
it didn't look as though he was coming in to supper.
So his wife stopped a neihhbour -- what shall I call
the neighbour? -- the neighbour Jim, -- stopped Jimmy
outside and said, "He hasn't come home. Have you seen
anything of him?" And knowing that his father had
committed suicide she said, "I'm a bit worried about
where he is." And Jimmy thought, "Yes, I know what
you're worried about, too. Perhaps he's done himself
in before his time." So he said, "We'll have a look
round for him." So he called some of the lads out
of the inn, and they got a lamp and went round up
in the woods, looking up in all the trees, and they
couldn't find him here, and they couldn't find him
there; and they went across the meadows, looked up
the river there, looked among the oak trees -- no
sign of him there. This went on till two o'clock
in the morning, and they couldn't find him. So Jimmy
came back and told the wife, "Can't find him anywhere."
So she began to think -- she wondered if she's ever see
him again. So he said, "We'll have another look round
at daylight." So Jimmy said, "Well, I'm going home
now, and we'll get a couple of hours sleep and we'll
have a look when the sun is up." Well, he went
indoors, an there was the missing man in his house
on the sofa with his missus.
Lomax: What happened as a result of that, Bob?
Robts: Well in the morning, the missus and the furniture
and half the house was ditched out in the lane, and 
never heard of from that day to this.
Lomax: What happened between the missing man and his wife?
Anything at all?
Robts: No.
Lomax: That was O.K., was it?
Robts: I don't believe to this day she knows anything about it.
