"I'm thinkin' in my heart,"Lead Belly said. We had asked him why, when
he was about to sing, he sat so quiet. That was always his way
before an audience-- to sit silent and relaxed, this man of terrible
energy, turning over in his mind God alone knows what thoughts ; then
at the signal to let loose his hands and his voice.
He crouched over his guitar as he played, as
his fingers made the incredibly swift , perfect runs; and he sang
with an intensity and passion that swayed audiences who could not
understand a single word [of his songs]. His eyes were
tight shut so that between his eyebrows there appeared two deep furrows
of concentration curving back like devil's horns. One foot kept
the beat steady while the other accented it . Lead
Belly had thought in his heart, the words and music leapt out of his brooding
relaxation, [to focus his whole being in [his] a song.] 
his whole being focused in a 
song.
