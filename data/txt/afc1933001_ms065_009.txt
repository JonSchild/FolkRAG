Dear Mr. Lomax:

    I am sorry that it has taken so long to answer
your letter of December 7, but there were some technical
difficulties involved in the matter of the demonstration
set. I have it all settled now, however, and have
obtained permission to prepare a set of fifty disks which
shall be lent to you for purposes of demonstration. There
will be no time limit on the loan. This method of doing
it has been dictated by our abandoning the practice of
giving away disks. If you will send Alan the list of titles
in which you are interested, I will tell him to arrange
for their duplication.

    My work has been so hectic of late and I have been
so terribly busy that I simply cannot sit down and write
a nice friendly letter. Things are moving very fast here
now. Our applications for a grant have been in the hands
of the foundations for some time, but there is still much
argument back and forth. As soon as I have some news
about this and I hope that it will be good news - I shall
write you immediately.

    With best wishes to the Lomax family for a merry
Christmas and a happy New Year,
    incerely yours,
    Harold Spivacke
    Chief, Division of Music
