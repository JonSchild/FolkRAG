Mr. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have spoken to Mr. Dornbush about the 
cowboy singers again and he informs me that,
although it may not be widely publisized it 
will probably take place at the White House
and that  the President will probably attend.
Mr. Dornbush has further ascertained that
among the President's favourite songs are
"Home on the Range", "Bury Me Not", "Old 
Paint", "Chisolm Trail".  Perhaps this information
will make the choice easier.  Please
let me know at your earliest convenience if 
you can recommend any suitable group.

With best regards,

Sincerely yours,


Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
