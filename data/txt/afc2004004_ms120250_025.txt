Dear Mr. Lomax.
Your letter dated July 13, 1937 is at hand and I wish 
to let you know how much I appreciate your sending me the records 
and the needles. They are indeed very interesting and my visitors, 
especially those who understand music, will certainly enjoy them.
In case I should be out of the needles you so kindly 
sent me, can I use those we have for our other music records? I am 
also taking advantage of your offer in asking you to send me, when 
possible, "Papa Vincent" and "Nibo". Thanks ever so much for same.
we are always thinking of both you and Mrs. Lomax. My family 
join me in wishing you perfect health and continued happiness. 
With best regards to you and to Mrs. Lomax from Mrs. Leon,
the children, Miss Desce and myself, I remain,
Yours very truly,
Rulx Leon
