I'm a gonna tell you fascists, you may be surprised,
[Th'] Free people in this world are gettin' organized!
You're bound to lose,
You fascists bound to lose!
Along that Russian border I heard the people say
We killed ten thousand Nazis in just a single day!
You're bound to lose,
You fascists bound to lose!

CHORUS: All of you fascists bound to lose
All of you fascists [gonna] bound to lose
All of you fascists [gonna] bound to lose
You're bound to lose, you fascists, bound to lose!

You cannot divide us nor keep us split apart,
Us common folks is on the march, got freedom in our heart,
You're bound to lose,
You fascists bound to lose!
People of every color fighting side by side
Marching cross the fields where a million fascists died!
You're bound to lose, you fascists bound to lose!

Men and women together, yes, and children, too;
we'll rid this world of robbers before this war is through!
You're bound to lose,
You fascists bound to lose!
Take me to the battle, hand to me my gun,
I'll bring an end to slavery before this world is won!
You're bound to lose,
You fascists bound to lose!
