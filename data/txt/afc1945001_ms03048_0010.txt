Philadelphia, Pa.

Dear Mr. Dill:

As requested in your letter of July 30, a report in triplicate in connection with the study of rumors is attached.

I trust that the following suggestions will be in order and might possibly have the germ of something worth while.

The hitch-hiker and floaters seem to have a fund of information that we settled workers do not have. I have made no attempt to evaluate the quality or accuracy, etc. of their information.

The successful locating of rumors is much more difficult and more of an art than I have suspected. My "interviewing" while still clumsy, is much better at the end of this week, than at the beginning. 

Should further work along this line  be required, the experiences and techniques suggested by various investigators might well be pooled in some manner. 

Very truly yours

Addison B. Henry
Manager, 
Field Office,
Sharon, Pa.
