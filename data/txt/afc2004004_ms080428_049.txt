LOMAX:  On my first trip for the Library of Congress with recording on a little acetate disc machine, I spent the summer with my wife and friends recording in the Cumberland Plateau, in the mining country and among other things, this little mining family recorded a little mountain girl.  It was late in the Fall and it was cold.  She was standing in front of the fire to keep warm, her little thin skirt and panties and bare feet, standing on her toes to warm and she sang the song that has become I suppose the main anthem of the industrial union organization which she had composed about her father.

My Daddy is a Miner, etc.

Which side are you on

Well it was a moving experience for a folklorist because what this child had done and so many of her ancestors did, was to take an old tune and put new words to it and this one goes way back, it goes back to an English ballad that tells about how a young lady went to pursue her sailor sweetheart
