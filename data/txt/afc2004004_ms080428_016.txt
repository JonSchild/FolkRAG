MAN   Oh yes here is is. 

INTERVIEWER Wait a minute. 

MAN  This is from an encounter between a, 
between an early writer about the 
mountains and old fellow he met way
up some hollow. He said, "Well where
did your people come from?" He said, 
"Well my folks come over here with 
Christopher Columbus on an old sail
ship, but when they got up here they 
kind of got wild and took to 
following game and wandering to and 
fro, till the generations, they all
 evaporated and the only ones..shit. 
 
Now my folks came over here with 
 Christopher Columbus on an old 
 sailing ship, when they got up here
 they got kinda wild and took to
 following game, to and fro, till the 
 generations, they all evaporated and 
 the only ones of them that were left
 here had just enough strength to
 climb into these hills. And they 
 actually found people in the hills
 area that didn't have any religion, 
 they had gone beyond all the social
convention, because they were cut 
off there for nearly a hundred by 
the country that they had settled
