Dear Sir
An old lady from W, Va. who
lives next to me sings just like
Aunt Molly. Her name is
Mrs. Tenney - 470 Loomis Ave
Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio
As leader of Troop 31, I am
interested in singing and we are
working on our minstrel
badge at the present time.
I am glad I can hear
your Tuesday programs but
I didn't know about them
till last week. I am sure
they will be a great deal
of help to me.
Sincerely
Mrs. George Hensler
476 Loomis Ave
Cuyahoga Falls Ohio
