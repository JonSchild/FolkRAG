Dear Mr. Spivacke:

A ballad collecting trip in midsummer
through the region of Arkansas
Louisiana and Mississippi and
along the River, where I had planned 
to go, would be dangerous. We would
live among millions of mosquitoes,
miasma, high temperatures, bugs,
impossible (for us) humidity. To
come via the Ozark Mountains in
Arkansas, then Tennessee, Kentucky,
and Virginia, would be a different
matter. I had planned the Southern
routhe where "leads" are thickest.
But it is now too late, except
for hardy and reckless youngsters.
