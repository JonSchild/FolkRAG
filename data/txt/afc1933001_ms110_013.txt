September 10, 1940

Dear Bess:

Thanks for your very nice letter about the program. 
As to the trip; first use a tuning fork or pitch pipe,
second, record the parts of harmony and the tuning of in-
struments as you and Ruth and I have discussed it, third,
get Father to talk with singers, extensively, using tips
from the Questionnaire or any other approach, but get them
to talk, naturally, fourth, write down everything you see
and hear and take all the pictures you can. 

We will be at home and demanding to see you all during
the last part of September. Much, much love. I'm going on
vacation. Blind Lemon, as the first Negro folk singer to be
recorded commercially is well worth running down. Get the 
interview down on records.

With love,

Alan
