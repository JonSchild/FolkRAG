        It does not seem advisable to attempt to answer rumors by direct correspondence.
Unsolicited rumors should be acknowledged. Where such rumors have already
been answered in print, reprints of the appropriate columns may be forwarded. It
should be made clear to the public, however, that rumors will not be answered by
providing individuals of good will with letters attesting to the facts. The cooperation
of reference librarians should be secured and publicized to help members of the
community to track down factual information. The rumor column should be preserved
as an instrument of the total educational program. The use of people sufficiently
concerned about special topics to write in concerning them should be reviewed by
the Educational Director. They may prove good discussion group leaders, lecturers,
outlets for printed matter, etc. Their reports should be included in the analyses
of the Research Director and in this fashion contribute to the definition of the educational
program. If their rumors merit attention, they should be dealt with in
accordance with the perspective of the entire program. If the rumors warrant direct
direct counteraction, the colum will take care of it --- if indirect, the regular
programming will serve; and if it is wisest to table the material for a while, this
can best be decided by those responsible for the definition of the activity of the
project as a whole. 
        B. Form for the Direct Counteraction
        The organizing of counteracting material should be done with great care,
sufficiently long in advance to permit its circulation among the experts on the advisory
council and other specialists whose cooperation may be secured. Counteracting
material must be based on authoritative information. A major function of the direct
counteraction program should be the helping of people to learn how to select good
sources for information. Care should be taken to indicate clearly what the authoritative
souce is; and where feasible, desirable methods of approaching the authoritative
source or keeping in touch with official information along the lines involved are
to be presented. The counteracting statements must be complete, devastating. A
