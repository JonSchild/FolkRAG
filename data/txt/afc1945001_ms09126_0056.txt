What the War Brings

December 7th was the day
of Japan's treachery
and all the boys went away
to far off shores of misery!

And at home we of the young and old,
Go around laughing and full of boast,
Trying to to act brave and bold,
While our hearts are crying to the host
Because of love and love that is lost

We surrender to rationing,
of sugar meal and tin,
while others will hoard in the flour bin,
