     A posse of seven cowpunchers galloped north across
the boundary between Montana and Canada. The night before a 
big horse steal had robbed them of their best saddle horses,
including the top horse of Dave Hodgins, who led the group of
Vigilantes. Who steals my hoss steals my jewels, runs the 
code of the West. As they swung into Lone Pine Coulee they
came suddenly on Bull Creek Miller, afoot and limping badly.
Seven stalwart riders drew rein and faced the men they knew
and suspected.
     No one spoke while Bull Creek Miller stood and stared.
Presently the group of horsemen drew together and consulted.
Dave Hodgins was to act as prosecuting attorney.
     "Answer my questions," commanded Hodgins, "and don't
forget that your answers will decide your fate. Did you steal 
my pitchin' sorrel?"
     "Well, I took your hoss all right," replied Miller, "but
now that he's piled me and gone back to your ranch, you ought to
call the matter finished."
     "Did you help a gang steal other horses here during the 
last six months?" inquired Hodgins.
     "Yes. I was working with a gang. But hell, Hodgins, 
there's no great crime in stealing a few cayuses, is there?"
