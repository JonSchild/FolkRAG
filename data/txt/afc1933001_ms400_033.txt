Adventures of a Ballad-Hunter

And it was along about three o'clock in "dem, long, hot
summer days," when the heat seemed unsupportable, when the sun went
down so slowly that it "pull to stop" that they would shout in

Booker Washington, wise, tolerant, a gifted orator, a great
leader of his people, urged Negroes to preserve their glorious spirituals
as well as their rhythmic songs to labor. Often during his addresses
he cast aside the white man's hymnal and led the audience in
singing the songs of the black race. "Develop yourselves as Negroes,
not merely imitate the white" he urged. But I have found few followers
in this regard, of that gifted man. Even in the South at no church
in the cities can the old time spirituals be heard sung in the simple,
manner of the old days, or as one can yet hear them in country
communities. City church choirs do sing the old spirituals, but in such
musical phrases that destroy the charm of the beautiful old melodies.
One has to go to the back country, or to communities where the churches
are not large enough to attract the educated or semi-educated minister, to
hear these songs sung with the emotional fervor and vigor that give them
their chief charm. "We have grown beyond such crude songs" said an intelligent
Alabama Negro to me when I asked for help in collecting Negro
folk songs.
