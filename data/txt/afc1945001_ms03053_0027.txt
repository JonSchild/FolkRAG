            AVAILABILITY OF RUMOR COLLECTORS FOR FUTURE STUDIES

            With reference to your memorandum of October 3, I submit herewith 
the names, addresses and reactions of the persons who served me as rumor
collectors in the recent study:

            EZRA J. FJELDSTED, Executive Secretary, Ogden Chamber of Commerce
                        Hotel Ben Lomond
                        Ogden, Utah

                        Mr. Fjeldsted took immediate grasp of this study, proved himself
            a capable assistant and would be willing to serve in future surveys.
            He would not like to be held to this work on a continuing basis, but
            would be glad to assist at any time for a designated week or a 
            designated number of days.

            DR. E. E. GREENWELL, Dentist, First Security Bank Bldg., Ogden
                        Home address: 876 – 24th St.
                        Ogden, Utah

                        Dr. Greenwell would be an excellent assistant in future studies
            of this nature and would be willing to assist on any basis that would
            not require continual observation.

            GEORGE W. HAYCOCK
                        322 Beason Building
                        Salt Lake City, Utah

                        Mr. Haycock is Representative of the United Steel Workers of
            American for Utah (CIO). He is a young and capable Labor executive
            and will be most willing to serve as a rumor–collector on any basis
            whatsoever. He personally suggested that he would like to collect
            rumors on a day-to-day basis and submit them when desired.

            MRS. S. E. JOHNSON, Proprietor
                        Betty Kay Beauty Parlor
                        174 1/2 South Main St.
                        Salt Lake City, Utah

                        Mrs. Johnson did a good job for me on this recent study and will
            be most willing to cooperate in the future. She would prefer that
            the assignments be confined to a specific week at regular 
            intervals.
