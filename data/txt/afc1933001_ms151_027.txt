Mr. David P. Bennett
211 Pittsboro Street
Chapel Hill, North Carolina

Dear Mr. Bennett:

     Mr. Lunsford's records cannot be used without 
his permission, so a preliminary step in making the
material available to you would be a letter from Mr.
Lunsford giving you permission to use his material.

     At present we have no duplication facilities in
the Library of Congress. This means that we cannot
make records available to you unless they are duplicated
by a commercial recording company outside the
Library. The average price for a twelve-inch record
is between $1.25 and $1.50.

     I regret that I am unable to send you a check
list of the North Caroline material that we have, but
a lack of secretarial assistance in my division makes
it impossible. I shall try to prepare a provisional
list within the next two weeks, meanwhile I shall await
the results of your negotiations wish Mr. Lunsford.
His songs form the largest single unit of North Carolina
material in the Archives. Other material has been
recorded by Herbert Halpert, Federal Writers' Project of
The W. P. A., New York City, by John A. Lomax, through
the courtesy of Doctor Frank C. Brown, and by Mrs.
Sidney Robertson, Federal Music Project of the W. P. A.,
San Francisco, California. I suggest that you write
Mr. Halpert, Doctor Brown and Mrs. Robertson for their
permission to use the material in the Archives.

     We have a total of 145 records made in the mountains
of North Carolina. This will amount to about 400 titles
of separate items.

     I shall be glad to hear from you after you have got
in touch with these various collectors.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folk Song
