Fisk, 15.  8.    WILL STARK

A:  Were these dances a rough as dances are nowadays?
S:  No sir.  They used so hardly ever have a fight.  That is before Prohibition,
you know.  People could get plenty of whiskey; they didn't
care for it.  If a man got drunk, they'd just take and lay him off
aside and keep on dancing.  They didn't get fighting drunk like they do now.
A:  How long did these dances a last -- all night long?
S:  Sometimes they'd last all night.  Sometimes in the Christmas
they'd last two days.  Dance all night til they just give out and
quit and soon they'd get rested and catch some sleep, they'd just
dance again.
A:  Lots of courting going on I guess?
S:  Yessir. Yessir.
A:  Were the girls so free as they are nowadays"
S:  No sir, they was not.  Girls was kind of particular.  Is that
running now?
A:  No.

As I was walking down the street,
A pretty white girl I chanced to meet.
I took her to her father's dwelling house
And we crept in as quiet as a mouse.
We let down the curtains and the windows, too.
I asked her for some of her doodle-li-doo.
Said, "doodle-li-do -- what is that?"
"Just like you mother's old pussy-cat.
Hairy all around and split in two,
That's what I call doodle-li-doo.

She say, "Father, father, forgive me do!
[Forgive] Johnny some of my doodle-li-do."
Her father say "You angel child,
Now you gonna have a little crocodile...
You learned your reputtition [when I was two] and ours, too.
For being it from with your doodle-li-do."

Her mother say, "You Goddam bitch;
I wish to God I had a switch.
I'd cut your ass both black and blue
And sew up you granny-dodging doodle-li-do.
(laughter)
