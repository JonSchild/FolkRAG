26

MRS. DAVIS:
and after we got turned around by the different churches. 26 (?) people came from around the Community Baptist Church. There was Linda Caron, one of Rev. Davis good friends, Junior met her here, seen her so many times at the hospital and my nephew, and a boy named Richard and somebody else all was in the Community they missed it you know.
LARRY:
They didn't know about it?
MRS. DAVIS:
They didn't know where it was. I had called Linda, she lived in the Hotel, I called that morning I had missed her she had gone on out, and I told them to tell her if she did call to the house to tell her where the funeral was going to be. But you see the way they did, they come the Community Center out here, they couldn't find out because I had 8:00 they had plenty of time to have gotten there, they said they didn't know where which way to turn, so they went on to a restaurant downtown
and went eating Chinese Food and thats how they missed it. All
of them, they're always together, my nephew was with them and 
everybody and he called me and read me out, because he was crazy
about his uncle, I say well George, thats no excuse for you, your
wife was at the funeral, theres no excuse for you and I said you
been calling me, you could have asked me, I thought she had told
you, so he was upset because he didn't I got a sweet letter from
 ----------- yesterday and thats what I have to do tomorrow, answer
it back to her sweet letter. She was very much devoted to Bro.
Davis, and he was devoted to her. There was no use to stay at
