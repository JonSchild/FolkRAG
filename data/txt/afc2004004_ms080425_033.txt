pitch a little bit lower to take advantage of that and then
once the voices warm up during the day, you gradually raise 
the pitch.    But this music is consistently pitched a little
bit lower than its written anyway, because in the early
books-- if you look in the Bay Song Book, for example--
they say that you pitch this music so the high part doesn't
squeal and the low part doesn't grunt.   And the habit of
the composers is that when they compose a tune, they pick
the highest and the lowest tone and they place them on
the staff so that they use very little ledger line- they 
don't like ledger line.  Well, this automatically means
that the music is going to be anywhere from a tone to a
tone and a half higher than it should be.  And what the
pitcher does is he accomodates this tone to tone and a half
higher by lowering that much.   So when he's pitching a tone,
supposed to be "F" he's actually about an E flat.   But
you have to do this cause if you don't, you'll have your
high part squealing and if you miss it very much on the 
low side, you'll have your low part grunting.   So it becomes
a built in, almost automatic correction.   But you'll
notice here today, for example, that they sing 100 songs,
and maybe repitch one.  It's a little unusual to re-pitch any.
So they have it down to a fine science.

AL:   What about the sliding notes?   That's always interested
me a lot?
