you know, jus' a lil' before my baby was bo'n. A good lil' bit 
befo' she was bo'n.   I'd be home by myse'f, ya know, most all 
the time.   You know that, over Osierfield, there.  [We'd be] Where 
we stayed, nobody on this place but us, you know, colored.   Was 
on this plantation, [was the] Mr. Langford's Place?   He had a small plantation.  Anything else needed to do, he'd hire other hands.   But me 
an'Mama an' jes', an' my cousin?   Was, was there.   An' sometime Miss 
Melissa was with us, ya know.   But that was, we was just there on 
the place to do anything we could do, ya know.  All his plow han's 
was his boys an' other, colored mens he hired.
        An' so, right over from us there was a bunch, was a white 
man with five boys, big boys.   'Cause he had a wife, but she 
was ailin' like, ya know?   Ah' ah, they name was Maddox.   An' 
one day I seed him out in the road.   Right were -- our house 
was sittin' up off in a little field like, an' the gate was 'tween 
the. . .an' the railroad, there, then a gate, you know, where the 
field was fenced in.  An' ah, den, over, just on the other side a 
the railroad was a little dirt road where ya go to Osierfield.  
An' then plum trees all sit all on that side, ya know, [like] right 
there between the, across the dirt road, see?  Next to the next 
field.

        An' I looked out there one mornin' after Mama left an' I 
seed somebody out there, see the buggy out there.  Then I looked 
to see who [out there,] that un'neath the plum tree.  The yella plums,
ya know?   I liked to get those plums, myself, ya know.  Right, 
right, it wasn't far from the next white people's house, the Rices.  
        So, an' I look, it was this white man standin' out there.  With 
all hisse'f out.   Beckon' an' shakin' at me.   Beckon' an' shakin' 
his nasty self.   Had all his meat out.   I shut that do', Buddy!
