Woe until Hypocrites and modern pharisees
To make one proselite, you travel land and sea
Then when you have made one, he's twofold worse than thee.
Woe be unto you

(CHORUS)
Woe be, woe be unto you, woe be, woe be unto you
If you hate your brother and sister
And rebuke them without cause
I say, woe be unto you.

Going hand in hand with drunkards, on the Sabbath day,
In council with the ungodly, standing in the sinners way
Dodging all prayer meetings for fear you are called to pray,
But woe be unto you.

You hate your brothers and sisters; but claim to love the Lord
Say mean things about them and carry their names abroad;
But when the Lord comes for judgement, He'll bring you your reward
But woe be unto you.

You go around here, doing as you please, drinking whisky and beer
Living a life of ease, and saying you don't care
Even tho men's heart do blead,
But woe be unto you.

You may drink your gin and throw your flasks away
Borrow from your friends; and don't intend to pay
For when you see them coming you'll turn some other way
Woe be unto you.

In the market places idling your time away,
Laying hellish plans to lead young people estray
For this you'll have to answer, in the great judgement day
Then woe be unto you.

Meddling other peoples business, and letting yours alone
Seeing faults in others, but never can see your own
Breaking up happy famlies, causing their hearts to mourn.
But woe be unto you.

You go to church on Sunday, and there you'll sing and shout,
Come back home on Monday, and curse your neighbors out.
You haven't got the Grace of God, and you don't know what it's all about
But woe be unto you.

You are a regular busy body, going from door to door,
Talking about your neighbors, saying things you don't know,
Raising perticular hell every where you go.
But woe be unto you.
