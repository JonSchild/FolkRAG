TAPE 10A - EWAN MCCOLL:
Roy's Wife:
Cho:  Roy's wife o' Aldivalloch (2)
Wat ye how she cheated me
As I come owre the Braes O' Ballaoch.

1)  She said she swore she would be mine,
She said she lo'ed me best o' any,
But o, the muckle faithless queen,
She's ta'en the carle and left her Johnny.

Braw Young Lad:
1)  There came a young lad to my daddy's door
To my daddy's door, to my daddy's door,
There came a young lad to my daddy's door
Came seeking me to woo.

Chorus:
And well but he was a braw young lad,
A brisk young lad and a braw young lad,
And well but he was a braw young lad
Come seeking me to woo.

2)  I set him in aside of the biink,
I gae him bread and ale to drink,
But ne'er a [good] blythe stymie wad he blink
Till he was warm and full. (Cho.)

The Highland Muster:
Little wat ye wha's coming. . . (4)

Ronald's coming, Donald's coming,
Harvey's coming, Ward's coming,
We'll fright the words o' the Pockpuds
For many-a bare arse is coming. . . .

Ewan: I got the songs from my father - he'd been a folksinger
all his life. He was an ironmoulder from Sterlingshire in Scotland.
By profession that -- by inclination he was a ballad singer, knew
hundreds. And the last two years of his life I began to take them
down. I'd learnt many of them, but the long ballads I'd never taken
any trouble to learn in any great detail. When it was obvious that
his health was fading, I began to take them down. - Sir Patrick
Spens, Hughie the Graeme, The Heir of Lynne, and about sixteen
others in detail, and quite a number of lyric songs and fragments.
He told me that Spens wasn't a Scots name - he'd never come across
