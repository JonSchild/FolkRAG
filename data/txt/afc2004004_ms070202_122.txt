bands defile to one side, sometimes a 
quarrel arises and the two groups fight. 
But all the time the vaxines and the vaus bar and 
the singers raise their voices higher and higher, 
the two rhythms and the two melodies gaining 
rather than losing in strength from having 
encountered one another.

The coronels are the most interesting military 
officials I have ever seen. They crouch in 
front of the bands, backing down the road 
like so many crabs, scowls of urgent self-
importance on their faces, growling out 
directions to the vaxiners. They point at the 
ground imperiously and the vaxiners sew 
the earth with their heavy seeds of sound. 
Whether the intent is to use the earth as a vibrator 
or not [I do not know] or whether the 
phallic vaxines are supposed to be sewing the 
earth I don't know. What the vaxiners 
do however is to crouch, dancing all the 
while, until the mouths of the bambous 
are within a few inches of the earth 
and the dust rises up with each roar
