My country 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing;
Land where my fathers died!
Land of the pilgrim's pride!
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring!

My native country thee, 
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love:
I love that rocks and rills,
They woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills,
Like that above.

Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song:
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake,
Let rocks their silence break 
The sound prolong.
Our fathers' God to thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing:
Long may our land be bright
With freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King!

(Tune: We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder

We are building a strong Union,
We are building a strong Union,
We are building a strong Union,
Workers in the mill.

Every member makes us stronger,
Every member makes us stronger,
Every member makes us stronger,
Workers in the mill.
