There are some funny saying making
there rounds. This one is about a lady
who had a son in the navy. She said
that Johnie wrote home and said
that every meal was a mess.

The other one is "Have you heard about
the man in the army that wanted to
join the navy. He said it wasn't because
of the boats, but because of the waves."

I have been writing to a sailor and
he calls coffee "mud." They also call food
"chow."
