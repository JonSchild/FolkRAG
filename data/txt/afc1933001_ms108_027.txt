Three times we have arrived 
at places just a day or two 
after Greta Garbo & Stokowski.
They were reported to be on their 
way to Taormina, but we haven't 
heard of their being there.

Your delightful letter deserves 
a better reply than I 
can give. You have such 
a vivid way of picturing events, 
so that often we read your 
letter we felt that we had 
had a brief visit with 
you or your household -
could almost visualize
little Susan. Wouldn't it 
be fun if you could come 
over with Johnny? There is 
still much of Europe that we 
could conquer together, and 
then you three youngsters
might go on some sprees
