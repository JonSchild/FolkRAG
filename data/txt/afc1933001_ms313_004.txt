In each case, sponsoring groups representing character
of the locality will act in cooperation with the Federal agency,
and whatever possible assistance will be given through contributions
for constructing and operating the center.  Such contributions
can be made in terms of either local material or cash.

DESCRIPTION Each center will consist of athletic and play areas, a hall and 
a stage, and will be planned so that it can be used for meetings,
basket-ball, dancing, dramatics and music.  Work shops will be
planned as a part of the building so that adults and children
can learn new crafts and experiment with such things as weaving,
carpentry, electricity.  The plan also includes room for
committee meetings and could be used by State Agricultural Extension
Services as either an extension library or the center
for traveling libraries.  Eight classrooms are included in the
design.  These classrooms will be used as nursery school centers,
play centers, and as adult education rooms.

If the school boards desire to make use of the building
during regular school hours, it may do so and thereby replace
the one and two room rural school,  However, the building will 
remain open all day and all evening in any event.  The operating
budget calls for upkeep and maintenance throughout and
provides for light, heat, water, janitor services, etc.

The actual process of construction will become a part of
the community education program.  Artists will work in the
community and will draw on the locality for their subjects in
making frescos, sculptural work, and in doing metal work.
