August 6, Rochester, Minnesota: - It looks like the present
administration is going to lose this war by failure to act aggressively.
If this country is so strong how can the Japs stay so close to Alaska
and why can't they be blasted out. Also why can't more than one raid
be made upon Japan. It is all caused by internal bickering as to where
to attack. Meanwhile the enemy gets all the gains. [*(42)*]
