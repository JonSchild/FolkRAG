adolescent and (or) college student
because I was adolescent &
college student - celebrity at the
same time.  The way the wound
of not belonging to the group was
healed was by Slig.  She's just
recently left me again - the old
hurt is in me.  I feel like dying
most of the time.  Want to jump
out of all the high windows
etc.. Can't sleep before exhaustion
All girls look wonderful.  But
I'm old enough to know better
& not really believe now.
