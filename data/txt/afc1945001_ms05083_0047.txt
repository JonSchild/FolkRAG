Soldiers visiting Austin from Camp Swift at Bastrop, 30 miles
distant, are frequently critical of the lack of entertainment
at Camp Swift and the inadequacy of transportation to Austin.
Lack of background and unsatisfactory social preparation of the
hostesses at Camp Swift came in for considerable comment.
