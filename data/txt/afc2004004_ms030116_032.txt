Lookin for somethin to happen one way or the other.  See?  You can't do a 
good job on a full stomach.  Then too again God requires us to lay down
everything to do His work.
Eliz: So that you don't drink, you don't do any of these amusements like
playing cards --
Rev. D:  No not that.  That don't bother me atall.  Don't keer what other
people doin.  Don't kill nobody fur doin that.  I'll tell you the reason
why:  Listen!  [You'll always wonder where] You know what I learned in life?  I learned where our best people is at. [Some time]
[we pass over our best people and goes to the best] You'll always wonder where
the best people is at an you'll never be able to know.  You see?  Some
time we pass over our best people.  An goes to the worst ones.  There's a 
whole lots I could talk an tell you bout that thing but you see -- there's
something within me an touchin me every once in awhile when I git ready
to tell you that there'll be another time when I'll be able to tell you.
Eliz:  You don't feel that you'd have the time to tell it, Rev. D?
Rev. D:  No. This is not the time fur it.  You want the truth, don't you?
Eliz:  Certainly.
Rev. D:  This is not the time fur it.
Eliz:  Not the time to tell what?
Rev. D:  What I started to tell you right then.
Eliz:  Where the best people are?
Rev. D:  Oh I could tell you where the best people are.  But somthin else
I started to tell you, it's not time for me to tell you.
Eliz:  You mean what happens during the week's revival?  The thing i asked -
Rev. D:  Noooooo!  I wadn't speakin bout that.
Mrs. D:  That was what she was wantin to get, dear.
Rev. D:  I'm speakin bout our best people.  About people playin cards an
like that.  I could tell you bout our best people. 
Eliz:  Well, you can tell me some other time if you want to.
Rev. D:  It will require me to wait.  It's not the time to tell you.
