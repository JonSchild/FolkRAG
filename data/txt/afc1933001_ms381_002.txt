Uncle John's Prophetic Error

On the Pleasant plantation, a slave known as Uncle John could
tell his master every morning what the master was going to do all that 
day. The manner in which Uncle John found out about Master Tom
Pleasant's plans wa[s] by hiding behind the chimney of the fire place at
the big house every evening. The master has a practice of telling
his wife soon after supper each night what he planned to do the next
day, and Uncle John had found this out.

After the evening evesdropping, Uncle John was prepared the next
morning to tell his master how many slaves were going to pick cotton,
how many were going to shop cord wood, how many were going to husk 
corn, etc. He was often called upon to make such predicitons, or
rather, as it seemed, to read his master's mind. At length Master
Tom Pleasant decided to make a thorough test of the darkie's fortune-telling
abilities. The Civil War had commenced, and he considered it
dangerous to have a fortune-teller among the slaves.

One Saturday night, shortly after Texas joined the Confederacy,
the master told his wife that he was going to whip Uncle John good
the next night, and find out whether he was fooling him or not.
Uncle John was behind the chimney as usual and heard what the master
had to say. The next morning the master called him and said,
"John, what am I going to do today?"

"Wal," said John, " Boss, yuh's gonna whip ol' john ter night."

"Yes," said the master, 'tonight at nine o'clock you meet me
out atthe stable and get your whipping."

The first thing Uncle John did was to go look for Uncle Jeremiah,
his best friend. He asked him to get a lantern and an old bugle; to 
get up in a tree near the stable shortly before nine o'clock that 
night, and wave the lantern and blow the trumpet every time he shouted 
to him to do so.

Uncle Jeremiah dis as he was commanded and was in the tree at
the hour appoijnted; Uncle John wa at the back stairs of the big
house, where the master soon appeared.

"Don' whip me, Massa, don' whip me," pleaded Uncle John.

"Ef yuh does, Ah's gwine call down Gab'ul f'om de heabens."

"Oh, yes," shouted the master," I am going to beat you good.
You know so much now, stop me from beating you."
