And I fee-ed him. That's the way I got him. And he was
one of the greatest men that ever was on this earth. And
he was killed in the first war. And they said he bayonetted
six Germans afore they got him.
     He got this tot of rum to go over the top, you know -
a chap Allan, and I hadn't mind of the other men - and he was
killed at a charge. And I'll swear he would have been some
lad. Oh, he was maybe three or four and twenty. I know a
good story about this Morrison.
     He. . . . . .This Matthew left to go to Canada. What a lot
of my best men went to Canada. And I knew about some of
them and I could tell you stories about some of them for a 
week. . . . . . .And this chap Matthew went off and he was second
foreman and I never wanted him to loose the Scheldt, but
he see-ed me coming and he'd come out. The foreman, you
know, a bit infra dig. - to loosing the Scheldt - but he
came out just after he'd become the foreman. . . . And I
said "Lord, Morrison, I never wanted you to do that." and
he said "I signed to louse your shelter and I'll louse your
shelter." "Man, I used to louse down there for fear he would
come out and take it out." He was just that kind of a man.
I didn't want him to do that kind of work after he was
foreman. You've no idea. . . . .
     Well. . . . . . I was away at anither ball. . . this is good. . . .
(Are you following my language?). . . . I was at anither ball.
Whatever way it was. . . . Morrison. . . I knew that he was leaving
and I should have paid him the night before. The housekeeper - 
I had a housekeeper at that time - my sister was married - and
she came into the room and said "Look here, sir, it's half past
five they came in to their breakfast. They got no more till
twelve o'clock". "Oh Lord" I said, "I should have paid
him" and I reaches out my pocket-book and I had some money.
