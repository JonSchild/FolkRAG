6)  It's wi' uncou' sweir I took them off, the lassie for to please,
But aye my breeks they larkit up aroun' my knees.
And a wasp gid (went) crawlin' up my legs in the middle of the psalms,
And never again will I rake (go) to kirk wi' out my nickytams.

7)  I often thocht I'd like to be a bobby in the force,
Or mebbe I'll get on the cart to drive a pair o' horse,
Wherever it'd my lot to be, the bobbies or the trams,
Losh, I'll ne'er forget the happy days I wore my nicky tams.

I just heard a ploughman go round singing that. . .
