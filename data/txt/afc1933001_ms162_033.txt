Dear Mr. Lomax:
I understand that you are not to be
in New York until some time next week
or the following week, so that this
note is not meant to hurry or press
you.
I do, however, want to remind you
that when you do get to New York,
to drop in to see me with reference
to your BACK WHERE I CAME FROM contract.
As you may or may not know, Nicholas
Ray has already signed his and we are
only awaiting your signature to clear
the decks for this program.
Best regards,
Sincerely yours,
Merritt H. Coleman
