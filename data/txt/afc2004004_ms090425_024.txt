Fisk, 20. 10
Let Me [Rock] Ride.
S: Listen, friends, weare gonna sing one of these old-time numbers,
a number that my mother, my grandmother sang around the fireside. I
listened to them late a night (Amen) and ask that everybody sing
(Amen), sing with uplifted voice. Now some of you might not know me.
My name is C.H. Savage, the pastor of the St. Joseph Baptist Church
of the Rinsing Sun, Mount Pilgrim and also St. James, naturally. I'm
asking all of you Christian folks to sing that old time way (Amen,
amen). We're goin to sing with uplifted voices.
Oh, Jesus,
Oh, let me [rock] ride,
