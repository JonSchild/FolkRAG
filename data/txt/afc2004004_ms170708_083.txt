Harry Cox. (Undated tape of Peter Kennedy's)
Cox: They'd go into the pub, an' they'd take the kiddie - they used
to do then. Drinke it away from them, if they went out.
Lomax: Yeah.
Cox: When the
you're not to go down there tonight. You're comin' home.
Lomax: Well, there was a lot of that going on?
Cox: Yeah, there was a whole lot o' it. O' course there was. A whole
lot o' it.
Lomax: Did the old man really know that it was going on all the time?
Cox: No, didn't know half.
Lomax: He'd think that his wife...
Cox: That's why they all like. Whole lot o' 'em
There's a song about that. I
never did know all o' it though. The song what er (mumble) Rex used
to sing it. I never did learn all o' it. "This poor man he go to sea,
oh hard is his case,/Many more are on the shore, an' no-one to take
his place." Yeah. (pause)
Lomax: Harry, sing the last couple of verses of this song.
Kennedy: Sing it all.
Lomax: What?
Kennedy: Get him to sing it all again. It's a good song.
Cox: What, that old song?
Kennedy: Yes.
Lomax: You don't want to splice on, eh Peter?
Kennedy: What?
Lomax: You don't want to splice on?
