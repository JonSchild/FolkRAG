YE BALLADE OF IVAN PETROFSKY SHEVAR

The sons of the prophet are valiant and bold,
And are wholly impervious to fear,
But the bravest of all was a man by the name
Of Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer.

If you wanted a man to encourage the van,
Or to harass the foe from the rear,
Or to storm a redoubt, you had only to shout
For Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer.

This son of the desert in battle aroused
Could spit twenty men on his spear,
A terrible creature, sober or soused,
Was Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer. 

There are brave men in plenty, and well known to fame,
In the army that's run by the Czar,
But the bravest of all a man by the base
Of Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

He could imitate Irving, tell fortunes by cards,
And play on the Spanish guitar.
In fact quite the cream of the Muscovite team
Was Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

One day that bold Russian he shouldered his gun,
And with his most cynical sneer,
Was going down town, when he came right upon
Brave Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer.

"Young man", said Boul Boul," is existence so dull,
That you hanker to end your career?
For, infidel, know you have trod on the toe
Of Abdullah Boul Boul Ameer.

"So take you last look upon sky, sea, brook,
And send your regrets to the Czar,
For by this I imply that you're going to die,
Oh, you Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.

"But your murderous threats are to me but a joke,
For my pleasure and pastime is war,
And I'll tread on your toes whens'er I may choose,"
Quoth Ivan Petrofsky Skevar.
