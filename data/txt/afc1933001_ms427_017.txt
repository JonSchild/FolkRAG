THE PICKET LINE

(Tune: Polly-wolly-doodle
Page 59 - Old Favorite Songs)

The Union is the place for me,
The place for working men
Who want some time to si ng andplay.
And money we can spend.

Chorus: On the line, on the line, on the picket picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight for the right
On thepicket, picket line.

I am a Union man because I want a living wage,
We'll stick together, we'll fight together,
We'll get that living wage.

Chorus: On the line, on the line, on the picket picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight for the right
On the picket, picket line.

The man who scabs is the man who's yellow
And is a sight to see,
We'll kick him out, we'll keep him out,
With the picket, picket line.

Chorus: On the line, on the line, on the picket picket line,
We'll win our fight, our fight for the right
On the picket, picket line.


SECRET LOVE
(Germany)

Page - 163 - Folk Songs of Many People, Vol. II)

No wood fire and no coal flame so burningly glows
As love that is hidden and that nobody knows.

No clove pink andno roses can blossom so fair
As when two true lovers their troth plight shall swear.

In my heart pray set a mirror and therein you'll see
My faith and my worship are only for theee.
