morning before they got up the 
Wasp was lost at the bottom 
of the tower- 52 people were 
drowned - 6 were saved. 

A week later the bodies rose
up to the surface. They were big
heavy men of 18 stone weights -
Englishmen - we don't like 
to be talking about the English 
in the Irish but we have 
to now & again - the bodies 
came from the west along the
point [t] where the women the
women were putting on the strand
no boots or stockings on them -
they saw the corpses coming they
ran off & left the seaweed. They
went home & shut the doors.
14 bodies came in under the 
tower without a shred of clothes 
on them.
