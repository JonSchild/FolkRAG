DRINKING AND GAMBLING
Why do the eagle fly so high?
don' want to hear his little babies cry.
Take a drink, because we're all goin' through this world for the last time.
For work I'm too lazy
And begging's too low;
train robbin's too dangerous,
To gamblin' I'll go.
Down in Kentucky lives an old Colonel who is said to eat whiskey with
his bread.
De stopper gits de longes' res' in de empty jug.
