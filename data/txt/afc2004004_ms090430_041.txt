The democratic theory of American society assumes universal education and
schools are, accordingly, attempted. But the facilities for Negro education
with respect to buildings, equipment and personnel make effective education
on the elementary level virtually impossible.

The presence of Tuskegee in the area has been felt against the stern
resistance of a decadent economic system for the area, and the results of

literacy has been declining in the county. In 1920, 23.3 per cent of the 
entire population was illiterate; in 1930 illiteracy had decreased to 19.0
per cent. Of the number of children between the ages of 6 and 20 who were
