The Castle
Edinburgh
July 22nd 1951
Dear Mr. MacPhee
Would you kindly let
me know if the BBC is
paying the fees for Burgess
and myself or is it the 
American people. I recorded
two Pibrochs and some
unpublished tunes of
my own.  I am sorry
to trouble you with this
matter. My address from 
25th will be SKAIL. Hotel
