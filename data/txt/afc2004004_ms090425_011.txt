Conversion Experience by Bro. Joiner.
Sisters and borthers and to the ministers and all that go to make up
this congregation... I know for myself that I been born again. How I
know I been borned again because I prayed, I mean I prayed. I'm gonna
tell you in a short way - - I'm not going all around it --I'm just
gonna tell you a little of it.
A: Tell us all about it. (laughter)
J. Well, er-uh I know I been converted. I was converted in 1900 in Ti[e]nnessee,
-- 20 miles the other side of Memphis. That's 41 years ago, And er-uh in
them days and times, when a revival would start, we'd run prayer meeting [?]
a week.  And [and] the old sisters and one thing and another, they had their
dresses [right] down right [there] then where they ought to be (laughter). And
they put they [harness] bonnets on [the knees] they heads. [and] And er-uh the dress would be long, you
know, and they'd tie [things] a string around their waist and gwan [go] to church and you
wouldn't seem em fan -- you wouldn't see em [knees] laugh -- you wouldn't see
em [picking] poking game[s]. [(light hum?)] And when I came through with religion, the[y] preacher
didn't have to preach like they preach now. The soldiers run [to] the
[me] meeting and sometimes [they] he couldn't hardly open the doors of the church --
[for] and when one come through, he'd [have to] hip him run the revival. [And, you know,] And -I - well - um - eh
(he stutters with excited recollection)-- you know - you know
when I got to talking about it, you know, it just [works] stirs me all up, it just
gits all over me. (responses)
Some folks, say - just like he told you [when they talking] about stars and one thing or another, --
well I'd go out, & you talking about the head getting [middle, you] wet in the midnight dew mine [that way] got wet
Mine got wet! And I would go out to my praying ground -- if I'd go to
sleep at a certain time, I'd tell the Lord to shake me. He'd shake me
at prayer time [me when I tell him.] [Then I would [go] sneak] Git out & steal on out to my praying ground,
git out there and pray, and go back home. And, when I got [through of] sho-nuff to
[the] praying, I didn't want to see nobody -- I didn't want to meet
nobody and wouldn't meet nobody. And er uh, [the] last [time] -- the last -the last prayer I prayed I went [out there]
[you know,] out one Sat. mornin & this time, they say, "We're gonna have [a mornin] mourner's meeting.
