My informant yesterday stated that "the Negro civilian men
residents of Anniston, Alabama are on the verge of mass open clashes
with Negro troops stationed at nearby Fort McClellan.  The Anniston
courts are busy disposing of numerous cases involving irregular 
domestic relations offenses.  A few days ago a Negro sergeant obtained 
a marriage license and married with ceremony the common-law wife of
seven years standing of an Anniston Negro. The robbed "husband" took
his grievance to court and lost."  [*33   8-7 Anniston, Ala.*]
