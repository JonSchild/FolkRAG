COLORADO     AUGUST 29, 1942

One of the rumors given wide circulation recently in the
downtown section of Denver has been this: That the United States
will supply a second front to Russia by Labor Day, at which time
we will have a worse condition so far as the Allies are concerned
than the bitter experience England had at the Battle of Dunkirk.
Kicked around quite frequently of late has been the story
of a Colorado sailor who returned on furlough and who is said to
have seen active duty in Russia. It was stated that his nerves
were jittery and that he was almost a mental case as a result of
his experiences. He ie said to have stated that after horrible
experiences on the ocean, the convoy finally landed in Russia but
the Russians said they were so busy fighting the war they couldn't
even help them unload the convoy. He said that when they were
subjected to an air attack, the Russians all ran to an air shelter
and showed their tickets to the air warden on guard at the entrance
before they were allowed admission. The American soldiers were told
to stand aside and after the last Russian had gained entrance they
were advised that the shelter was full and that no more could be
admitted. As a result the American soldiers had to take their
chances and stand around exposed to the enemy's fire. This story
