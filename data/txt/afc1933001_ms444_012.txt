Dear Mr. Lomax:
Professor Winslow has forwarded to us
your note of February 1 inasmuch as we control
the copyright on her book, AMERICAN BROADSIDE VERSE.

We write at once to say that we are glad
to grant you the necessary permission to reprint
the hymn on page 51 of AMERICAN BROADSIDE VERSE,
in the second volume of "American Ballads and
Folk Songs," with the understanding that you will 
give the usual credit to the author, book and publisher.

Sincerely yours,

Shirley Kupelian
