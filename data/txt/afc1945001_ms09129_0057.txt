A
Be alert don't get hurt.

Buy some stamps and be the champs.

Buy some Bonds + stamps and lick the tramps.

Don't get caught with your pants down
like Uncle Sam did.

Button your lip you give me the
pip

Don't please the Axis
get the faxis. (facts)

I drink to the Axis a toast
But I don't like to boast.

There's a pun about a bum

Go to school go to school so
you can lick the stickin' fool
