Cox:
In Barningham town there lived a man,
And he had such a lovely wife,
And so dearly she loved company,
As dearly as she loved her life, boys, life,
As dearly as she loved her life.

And this poor man he goes to sea,
His living for to get,
And where he spend one penny, she spend two,
And it's all for the wants of wit, boys, wit,
And it's all for the wants of wit.
