Dear Spivacke: Don't worry
yourself about what I wrote
about your failure to run
around a bit with me
last summer. Ask Alan
and he'd tell you I'm
thin-skinned and a grumbler.
I'm sensitive about my ignorance
of technical music;
besides, Strunk's change of attitude under
precisely similar circumstances gave
me an overdose of nervousness
when around you. I am pretty
deeply involved in my feeling
of deep friendship for you. At
the same I want you to feel
