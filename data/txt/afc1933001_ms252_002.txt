Dearest Father:

I'm sorry to tell you, but they've just put through a new ruling on me, and you will have to send a one-page report about your last trip before they will pay you for it. It needn't be long or particularly detailed; just get something in, and I swear by the Gods you'll get paid with speed. 

Your letter to Bess this morning sounded as though you're feeling better. I hope so. The various letters you asked for are coming along under separate cover.

Much love to you and Deanie from all of us.

Alan
