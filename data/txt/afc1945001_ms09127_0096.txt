BANDEMIER, MYRTle     [*A*] 

I heard a joke over the
radio.  A Marian just came
back from Guadacanal and
he said he had cane with
Japanese teeth and there
still alive.  The announcer
ask why.  He said because 
when ever a marine passes 
by it, the teeth still chatter. 

A soldier was sent meat
balls as a present.  While
on the battle fronts he ran
out of ammunation he decided 
to throw meat balls.  These meat
balls made him a hero because
they knock out 20 Japs.  Very
tender meat dont you think.
