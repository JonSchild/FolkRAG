Dear Mr. Lomax,

Please forgive the delay in answering your
letter. Decca Records was interested in handling
the records, and I was waiting for word from them.
They finally turned them down because the recording
was not up to their commercial standard. At present
I am attempting to interest the Carnegie Foundation
in these records. There is not the slightest doubt
in my mind that these records deserve to be made
available to schools and individuals interested in
them, but their recording quality makes them a very
great commercial risk.

As soon as I can give you the slightest additional
information on the progress of the negotiations with
the Carnegie Foundation, I shall not fail to do so.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,
D. Wolfert

Did you ever get back a few
Library originals I left with "[[G?]]"?
