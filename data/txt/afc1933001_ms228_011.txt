Dear Father:

   Our Singing Country is being set up and page proofed.
There were a lot of corrections to be made on the
galleys about one half of which were MacMillan's  Ruth's
appendix will be done this week and my introduction this
month.  You will get a copy of both before they are sent
in.  Mrs. Prink is in no hurry for either one.
   The matter of splitting fees on the C.B.S. programs
is as yet not beyond the lecture stage.  I've already
thought about that problem and you can be sure that if
my income ever gets out of control, you'll be notified
on green paper.  The enclosure you sent me made me awful
mad and I think I'm going to sue about it.  Very little
has been changed about the book.  I've spent endless
amounts of time on the two appendices and the galleys.
I'll write you a more gossipy letter soon.  We should
hear about the summer trip about the first week in July.
The reason I have not answered some of your letters is
that they did not catch up with me.

Always your son,
