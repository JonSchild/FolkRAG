gentle and we cd ride horse
back over the hills?
  I hope you think well
of these proposals. If you
do, will you tell me what
to brig? How many records,
how much film? Will we
need cooking apparatus,
mosquito netting, water
supply for our trip into
Okeechobee?
  My father died on Friday,
3 May. I saw him for 
the last time on Monday,
four days before his death.
He was the gallantest,
gayest gentleman that ever
lived. I now know what
it feels like to be absolutely
alone inside. Lying in his
coffin, he looked like Ariel
â€” a beautiful creature
