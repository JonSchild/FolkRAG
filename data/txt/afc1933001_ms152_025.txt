Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am glad to comply with your request of December
9 by sending you the typed copy of
the story of the old fiddler, as it appears
in my book, HANDICRAFTS OF THE SOUTHERN
HIGHLANDS.

You are very welcome, as far as I am concerned,
to refer to this in any way you care to, but
if you should have occasion to print it, it
would be necessary to take the matter up with
the Russell Sage Foundation because of their 
copyright on the book.

It is a pleasure to send this little story
as a small payment on my debt to you for the enjoyment
I have had from your singing.
Please remember me to Mr. Seeger.   I am hoping
some day to have a visit with you.

Sincerely,
[*Allen Eaton*]
Allen Eaton
