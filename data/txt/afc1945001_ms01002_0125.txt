should be repeated from time to time partly for practice, and
partly to permit the Research Director to analyze the accuracy of
the individual reporters with an eye to weeding out the unfit.
Training of this practical sort should also be given in estimating
people's age, social and economic level, and some of the other var-

in which the reporters will actually be functioning.
