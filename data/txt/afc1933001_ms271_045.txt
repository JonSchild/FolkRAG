LITTLE BROWN JUG
GOES MODERN

"HANK KEENE
IN TOWN"

New York City

Dear friend:

I used the enclosed song on my program the other night and it was an overnight sensation!
The mail came pouring in requesting it again!!!

Am passing it on to you. The tune is
"LITTLE BROWN JUG," but it's the words that gets  'em.

Please use it on your program at once and
watch the reaction - WOW!!

For additional copies write to: Hank Keene
Incorporated, South Coventry, Conn.
Sincerely yours,
Hank Keene - only copy
Hank Keene

P.S. The song, "LITTLE BROWN JUG GOES MODERN" will
soon be obtainable on leading records.
