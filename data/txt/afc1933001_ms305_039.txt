suit of useful knowledge. The first is
Bernard Smith's invigorating Forces
in American Criticism. It is, I think,
an original work, and one sure to be
used and quoted for a long time in
academic circles. It is based on Mr.
Smith's assumption that literary criticism
is more clearly related to social
history than are poetry and fiction.
In other words, he thinks that the
attitudes and opinions of literary
critics are a better index to the nature
and status of a decade than the
depictions of life and thought encountered
in works of the creative imagination.
It is not a wholly unassailable 
assumption. Mr. Smith's intellectual
equipment is so well-informed and
incisive, however, that out of this
hypothesis he has produced a vigorous
and valid survey of American
literary criticism. His appraisals
and re-evaluations command both attention
and respect, and if he has
been cautious in analyzing contemporary
criticism, he has in no case been
venal. His book is unquestionably
one that must be read by anyone pretending
to an interest in literature.

The other work in belles lettres to
which I wish to call attention this
month is an astonishing novel, The
Torguts, by W. L. River, an editor
of this magazine. It is astonishing because
it rescues from oblivion a human
exploit of vast proportions. 
How has it been possible, one thinks
as one reads Mr. River's pages, for
a migration of half a million people
in the year 1771 to have disappeared
from human memory? As Mr. River
remarks, there are practically no
written records of it. No writer has
touched it since Thomas DeQuincey,
and what that passionate and volatile
man knew of the Torguts' effort to
escape from Catherine the Great was
gleaned from two sources which were,

to say the least, fragmentary and distorted.
Mr. River's imaginative reconstruction
of this last of the great
primitive migrations is a bold and 
noteworthy creative effort, and succeeds
in relating the motives of the
Torgut leaders and people to the social
forces of their day, and ours.

It is impossible today to use the
phrase "human exploit of vast proportions,"
as I have done in referring
to Mr. River's novel, without the
mind reverting to the forever glorious
contribution to the advancement
of mankind made by the Spanish
people between the years 1936 and 
1939. Everyone now alive is intimately,
profoundly, in their debt.
Their valor and sacrifice held up international
fascism in its most dynamic
phase, and retarded it long enough
for the Soviet Union to cleanse itself
of internal enemies and to become
so strong that fascism no longer
dared to attack it. The result has been
that fascism and its master, capitalist
imperialism, have been teetering
on the verge of internecine war. How
different would have been the events
through which we now live but for
the heroism of the Spanish people!

The Spanish struggle is so vast a
theme that many books will be written
about it before it is completely encompassed
and fully manifest. I rejoice
that three volumes have just
appeared relating to it. One of these
does so only inferentially - Angna
Enters' Lo[?]e Possessed Juana. This is
a play concerning the mad daughter
of Ferdinand and Isabella in the time
of the Inquisition, and is full of that
ripe erudition which enables Miss
Enters to be the foremost mime of
her time. She has endeavored so to
portray late fifteenth century reaction
as to enable the reader to draw 
analogies to the most recent Spanish
struggle against reaction. And she
has succeeded to a surprising degree.
The text, however, is not really dramatic.
It is redolent with that elusive
reality called Spanish atmosphere,
and reading it is pleasurable because
of the creative personality of the
author. Miss Enters' own drawings
for the sets and costumes are reproduced,
as are the scores for some of
the songs called for by the text.

We come directly into contact with
the Spanish resistance to fascist invasion
in Edwin Rolfe's The Lincoln
Battalion and Alvah Bessie's Men in
Battle. The former is in no sense a definitive
history of the Americans who
went to fight in Spain and should
not be so approached. Mr. Rolfe has

assembled the principal facts about
the battles in which the battalion engaged,
and has gathered together
some facts about some of the individuals
in the battalion. We must be
grateful that he was able to preserve,
in the hurry and bustle of those brave
days, so much information about
American participation in that wonderful
exemplification of world solidarity,
the International Brigade.

One individual member of the
battalion has written an absorbing
record of his experiences. Alvah
Bessie is more the observer of inner
reactions than of external events, and
his pages are conditioned by this fact.
So were his experiences. He says he
went to Spain to achieve personal integration
and to do what he could to
fight fascism. The incidents and
events he records would have appeared
very different in the eyes of,
let us say, a professional soldier. He
has written a scrupulously honest
book. There are no heroics in his recital
of the brute facts encountered,
endured and surmounted by the boys
of the Lincoln Battalion - heroes all.
Bessie, the contemplative, has
succeeded in depicting the world of
action as the shambles it is when the
lords of reaction are slaughtering  the
men who prefer to "die on their feet
than live on their knees." He has done
so in a curious argot, half literary
and half out of the cannon's mouth.
