Hyden, Ky.,
Oct. 6, 1937

Dear Dr. Spivacke,

Yesterday I recorded Ky. 101. We are both exhausted.
The roads are terrible in dry weather, but in wet they are
something fearsome. The people are very timid, religious and
shy about performing. I would feel, however, that if I had to leave
Kentucky tomorrow that the 101 records give a good representative
picture of folk-singing in this state. The only thing I
lack is a dulcimer record and I would have had that last weekend
if my gallant old Studebaker hadn't failed me on the most
terrible hill I have ever encountered.

Enclosed you will find a bill from the Weston meter
people, signed by me. I think it can legitimately count on
my hundred dollars of extras, but at present I haven't the cash
to pay it. Could you arrange for Mr. Morgan to foot the bill?

I have three boxes of records ready to send, but due to
the fact that I have no shipping franks I can't send them.
Would you send me a few along with a few more envelopes by return
mail.. ...I received the shipment of one hundred records
yesterday and this afternoon in spite of a light case of flu
I'm starting into Clay County to see what I can find there.

Yesterday I recorded some fine ballads from a man who refused
to sing for Sharpe when he was here. He says that I'm more persistant . ..
Give my special regards to Mr. Henderson.

Yours,

Alan
