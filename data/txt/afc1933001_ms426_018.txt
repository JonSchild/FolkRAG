NO WOODEN SHOE FOR ME!

Tune: It Ain't Goin' to Rain No More.

Oh--we're living in the U.S.A.
We'll fight to win the day,
Production cost we'll make them pay
Or we'll feed them straw and hay.
For--the East wants all our food too cheap,
For the West, don't care a heap,
Our taxes keep on getting steep,
But the farmer dasn't peep.

Chorus.
Oh they're carving a pair of wooden shoes,
A pair for you and me.
They might shove them on in Italy
But they can't slip the slipper on me.
The grain gamblers have got a hunch,
They've felt the farmers' punch.
We'll give them crackers for their lunch,
Until they join our brunch.
We'll make the packers like our game,
They think we're kinda tame.
We'll shake those birds up just the same,
We'll win or bust a hame. 

The Union's made a mighty fight,
To win the farmer's right,
The enemy is sitting tight,
She's left them with her might.
For the farmer's waking up at last,
They'll go off like a blast;
Wall street will think she has been gassed,
Our slavery will be passed.

Old Washington is stirred up now,
The rubes have started a row;
They'll give us what we ask for now,
Or we don't push the plow.
For they're carving a pair of wooden shoes,
A pair for you and me.
They might shove them on in Italy,
But they can't slip the slipper on me.
