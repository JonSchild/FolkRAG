LET ME FLY

I got a brother in the Promised Land,
I never expect to stop until I shake his hand,
I'm not so particular 'bout shakin' his hand,
Lawd, I just want to meet him in the Promised Land.

CHORUS:    Lawd, let me fly,
                   Oh, let me fly,
                   Yes, let me fly to Mount Zion,
                   Lawd, Lawd.

I got a mother in the Promised Land,
I never expect to stop untio I shake her hand,
I'm not so particular 'bout shakin' her hand,
I just want to meet her in the Promised Land.    (CHORUS)

Oh, just let me tell you what a liar'll do,
He won't serve God and he won't let you.     (CHORUS)

Well, he'll go over to your house, he'll talk about me,
He'll come over to my house and talk about you.      (CHORUS)

He'll talk about Sally, he'll talk about Jane,
He say, "When  you go to tell her, don't you
                      call my name."                                 (CHORUS)

He say, "Oh, my sister, you oughta just know
"What a certain somebody told me about you."
Then he'll tell such a lie it'll astonish your mind,
It'll take a little truth just to make it shine.               (CHORUS)

Lawd, I got a saviour in the Promised Land,
I ever expect to stop until I shake his hand,
Not so particular about shakin' his hand,
I just want to meet him in the promised land.     (CHORUS)
