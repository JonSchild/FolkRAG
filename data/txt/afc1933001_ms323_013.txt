POSADA TIME IN MEXICO

By WILLIAM S. HARWOOD

     A delightful Mexican custom associated with the Holiday season is the very old ceremony of the Posada, which commemorates the journey of Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem. the ceremony begins on the night of December 16th and is repeated each night until Christmas eve.
     The Posada is a combined religious and social function, held in private homes to which numerous friends are invited. Upon beginning the ceremony, the guests are divided into two groups, one of which enters a separate room. The other group slowly marches around (usually in the patio, which is common to most Mexican houses), singing a very old religious song, known to every Mexican, in which the theme is that Joseph and Mary seeking refuge or posada. Each participant holds a lighted candle in his hand which adds to the beauty of the ceremony. The song is then answered by the group in

the other room; it is again taken up by the first group and again answered by the others. When "posada" is granted, all the guests mingle together for the hilarious ceremony at the piñata, which follows.
     The piñata is a large jar made of common pottery, filled with fruits, nuts and candy. it is always decorated with bright-colored paper and is often made into fantastic shapes. the piñata is suspended overhead by a rope, usually hung from opposite sides of the patio, and is controlled from above by some person stationed at a convenient second-story window or balcony. Successively, various persons are blindfolded, armed with a broomstick or club, and are led to a spot directly beneath the piñata with the club; on the other hand the person stationed above controlling the rope from which the piñata is suspended, tries to prevent it from being struck. And as might be imagined, the wild passes of the club in thin air can be ludicrously amusing.

     Sooner of later, of course, someone scores a direct hit, and as the contents of the piñata fall to the floor a wild scramble ensues--generally dominated by the most juvenile elements of the party. Sometimes several piñatas are broken successively. This terminates the prescribed tradition of the posada; afterwards the guests usually dance or otherwise enjoy themselves.
     There is a singular beauty about many of these quaint old Mexican customs such as the posada which, although they have long since outlived their original signification, are still handed down faithfully from generation to generation. They are so distinctly Mexican--which is another way of saying that they are distinctly gracious and beautiful. And the American visitor to Mexico will find, as the writer has found, that it is a privilege to see and take part in these customs in which the Mexican people lovingly carry on the traditions of their forefathers.
