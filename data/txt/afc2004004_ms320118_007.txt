cause my mother play an accordion, but she wouldn't play in
public, and he says,  they got someaccordion downstairs. But
I don't want to play the accordion.   Well, what you want to 
play?    I said,  I wanna learn something new.  So he says, you
think you want to learn the harmonica?   I don't know,  Iwanna
try.  So he said,  I'm gonna give you two weeks.   In two weeks 
from now, he says,  I wanna hear you blowwa tune on that
harmonica.   I started fighting on the harmonica, and in t[a]x
two weeks from them,  I was playing one of his old tunes, and 
I was blowing that on the harmonica.    (then he plays it on
the fiddle)   I don't even know what it's called, but my daddy
used to play that long time ago.......end of tape.
