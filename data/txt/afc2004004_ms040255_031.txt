No doubt you know the magnificent "Down In Yon Forest"
in the Oxford Carol Book which V.W. collected there.
     At the end of the war I met an ex-R.A.F. W.O.----a
real flying type who was very keen on music and is now
the manager of the Ha..e Concerts Society. He sang me
several low R.A.F. songs, such as "No Flak at All",
"Sammy Hall", etc., also that most blasphemous of 
recitations "The Monk of Great Renown." I soon realised
that many of these songs, though filthy, had delightful
tunes, and were most definitely folk-songs, which is
proved by the fact that every service, every squadron, even every Nissen
hut, had its own variant. So I investigated further and
made quite a collection, not only from the R.A.F., but also
from the Army, Land Army, also from ramblers. One of the
loveliest of these is "Baby Lie Low" ---one of the few with
printable words---no worse than the "Foggy-Foggy Dew"!
     Needless to say the snag of modern songs is the words.
So far my collection has had to be committed to memory as
I simply dare not write down the words. But recently
I've started writing them down, using substitutes of
blanks for the Anglo-Saxon words which are liberally used
in most of them.
     The songs, as you probably know, bear no relation to
the older English songs. They are mostly in 3/4 or 6/8
time and show no modal or pentatonic tendencies. Instead
they often contain chromatic figures, such as F,G,G sharp,
A, and for some obscure reason many contain a repetitive
figure such as C,E,E? C.E,E,
