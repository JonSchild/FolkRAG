Alan Lomax, Esq. 
C/o B.B.C, Glasgow.

Celtics Department at Glasgow.  These songs, I understand, were
recorded by Peggy Maciver and Angus Kenneth Maciver, and, in our
log of original recordings, their numbers are 145 and 155 respectively.
The titles are: - "He ro nightean chinn-dubh aluinn" and 
"Fhir a dhireas an bealach".  I must make it quite clear to you
that it was entirely out of order for you to make these copies
without asking the express permission of Edinburgh University,
and that, although you have them on your tape, you must realise you
are not at liberty to make use of them for purposes of publication
or for making other copies.  This does not mean, of course, that
the material we have in our archives is not copied for other
purposes.  Indeed it is, but those copies are issued to certain
institutions for particular purposes and the rights in how they
are used remain, and must remain, with this University. I trust
that you fully understand this position.

Yours sincerely,
[S.T?]
