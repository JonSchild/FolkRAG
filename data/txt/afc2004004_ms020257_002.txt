BESSIE JONES  TAPE 43

This is a one-sided tape at 3 3/4 IPS, being all dialogue and in 
great part reiteration of material dicated the 
previous autumn. Interview by Alan Lomax on March 14, 1962 in 
New York City. Transcribed by Dena Hirsch. 

NOTE: Speakers sound very far away from mike. Tape, upon transcription, 
was found to be quite warped, and might have deteriorated;
hence, blank spots in transcription. Quality varies throughout 
tape, but all bad.
