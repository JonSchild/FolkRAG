The Gaelic

A lot of people of my age now
say "Och I wish I could speak
Gaelic." -- but formerly they 
would be ashamed to admit they know
the language.
If you can [speak &] sprok
G, you've got an easy way to
speak G.
It is very traditional
The children hereabouts aren't keeping
their G but out on the islands
the ch all have to learn Eng
Neither of the men feel very optimistic
about continuation of language
