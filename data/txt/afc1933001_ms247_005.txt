The car was in no way damaged and I was so 
happy at that that I smiled at a policeman.  Net
cost so far.

 Mrs. Krahl phoned this morning for news of her suit
and from her anxious manner I suppose she expects us to replace
what we have lost of theirs.  I am to see her this afternoon and
cannot, do you think, do otherwise than tell[ing] her [that] to go ahead
and replace her loss?

The police said that recovery of stolen property was practically 
hopeless, especially for an out-of-town person.  I shall,
nevertheless, this morning go to the station and file a complaint
and perhaps put an ad in a Hearst-paper.

We can, I think, go home on the tires & wheels that
the thieves gave us.  I shall, however, before I see you be
forced to buy a spare & locks and a few clothes, toothbrush,
razor, nothing more.
