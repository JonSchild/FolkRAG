WAY OUT IN IDAHO
Come, all you jolly railroad men and I'll sing you 
if I can
Of the trials and tribulations of a godless railroad
man
Who started out from Denver his fortune to make grow
And struck the Oregon short line way out in Idaho. Chorus
Chorus: 
Way out in Idaho, way out in Idaho
A-workin' on the narrow gauge, way out in Idaho.
I was bumming round in Denver one dark and rainy day
When Kilpatrick's man Ketcher stepped up to me and
did say
I'll lay you down five dollars as quickly as I can
And you'll hurry up and catch the train she's starting
for Cheyenne
He laid me down five dollars, like many another man
And I started for depot as happy as a claim
When I got to Porcutello, my troubles began to grow
A-wadin' through the sagebrush in frost and rain and
snow. 
When I got to American Falls, it was there I med with
Jack
He said he kept a hotel in a               fashion shack
We hear you are a stranger and perhaps your funds are
low
Well yonder stands my hotel xxx tent in the best in Idaho.
I followed my conductor into his hotel tent
And for one hot meal paid him my last cent
But Jack's a jolly fellow and you'll always find him so
A-working on the narrow gauge way out in Idaho.
He put me to work next mornin' with a cranky cuss
called Bill
And they give a ten pound hammer to strike upon
a drill
They said if I didn't like it I could take my shirt
and go
And they'd keep my blanket for my board way out in 
Idaho.
It had filled my heart with pity as I walked along 
the track
To see so many old bummers with their turkeys on 
their back
They said the work heavy and the grub they could
not go
Around Kilpatrick's [  ?   ]  tables way out in Idaho.
