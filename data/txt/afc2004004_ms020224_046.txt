you got 15 bale a cotton.  The cotton go up high?  An' the, an',
you know, the sales go up high?  Whatsoever he owned you for all
lil' items -- I don't care what it was -- why, an' then he sell
ah, a, a, about 7, 8 bales, or 10 bales a that cotton, and the
seeds, an' what-whatsoever it amounts to, and then all a his
money's tuk out.  'Cause Mama an' them have had as high as 7
bales a cotton in the warehouses -- they own natchul cotton, clear
a debt.  An' paid up.
      An' ya know what happened?  They boint
(burned) the gin house down.  Wit' the cotton in there.  Cotton
wa'n' in there.  'Cause when, when, when Mr. Jim (HER STEPFATHER,
JIM SAMSON) an' them went to search for the ban's (THE STEEL BALING BANDS)
there wasn't a ban' in there.  An' Mr. Jim had 7 bales an' Mr.,
Mr. ah, ah, Sam Brady, I think he had 11, an' some mo' peoples
had -- the lowest was, ah, was in there, was 5 bales.  Diffrunt
ones done paid outa debt.
[*(EXCELLENT STORY: WHITES BURN THE BALED COTTON)]
     An' he tolt 'em, "Y'all wait; I'll let ya know when to sell --
when, when, "you know,  "Cotton goes up.  Don't sell it now.  Don't
sell it now."  He's dead though.  His son killed 'im unknown to
'im.  Didn' mean to do it, but God jus' fixed it that way.
     But I'm tellin' you, that's what happened!  An' Mama -- I'll
tell ya:  Mama said she fell out with it.  Fell out with the
cotton [thing] plant.  Fell out with everything.  'Cause all these years
-- farmed there 11 years -- that's the year they come out 'way
ahead.  They always come out ahead, every year, Mr. Jim did.  But
that was 'way ahead, ya see.  An' they had enough to sell -- then 
beside, the seed.
     Sumpin' happened that night, some way or other.  They had
someone to get that cotton an' that, [those] them seeds outa there.  You
hear me?  An' they set that thing afire.  Mr. Sam Brady
