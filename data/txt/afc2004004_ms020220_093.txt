         Miss Susie bought me a nice dress. 'Cause Mama tol' her, 
she said, ain't gonna pick none. She wanted to pick some to let 'er
have fer to git me a dress to wear to the baptizin'. An' Miss Susie
Diller bought me -- I'll never forgit it: A pretty polka-dot
dress. Oh, it was ah, it was blue polka-dot then it have a
heav-heavy blue border of braid around it and in the sleeve.
Oh, it was pretty! I thought that was the prettiest dress I
ever seed.
TL: This was in Fitzgerald...?
BH: Dawson!
TL: This was still in Dawson?
BJ: Yes, I was little. I was 8 years old. Yeah. An'...
TL: Was your house in Dawson in the town? Did I ask you that?
BH: Uh, uh-huh. That was...
TL: It was out in the country?
BJ: We stayed two miles out from town.
BJ: I never have stayed over 3 miles from town. 
TL: Oh, really?
BJ: In my whole life. You know, comin' up. If I wasn' in town
I was jus' about three miles. We could walk over town. I never
have stayed 'way out in the sticks. But we used to go to the
sticks to peoples that we knowed -- to churches an' see the people
that we know, 'way out in the country, eight and 10 miles from
town. Oh, goodness, that's awful! I never have stayed that,
like that from town. Nev-never have. I was around from 2 to
3, like that, out from town. Never stayed no further from town
than I could hear the whistles blow at 12 o'clock an' all like
that, ya know? An' I could walk to town when I was little.
