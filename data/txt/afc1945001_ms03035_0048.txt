[*Patrolman A.*] [RE: RUMORS]
[*1.*] During a conversation with a Colored man, described as
27 years old, 5 ft10 inches, 140 lbs, who was dressed in working
clothes, at Fifth and Michigan Avenue. As we were discussing various
subjects this man stated that he had heard from different persons,
there was very much dissension between the White and Colored soldiers
in regards to the way they were being treated, but did not enlarge
on the topic of discussion. This was one reason he stated he did not
want to go into the army.

[*2.*] While engaged in a conversation with a Mexican, described
as 32 years, 5 ft. 10 in. 190 lbs. small mustache and well dressed, 
at 6th and Michigan Avenue. He stated that he was going to a Doctor
to have a blood test and that if you knew a Doctor well enough you
could give about $50.00 and the Doctor would give you a shot which
would prevent you from passing the army test.
