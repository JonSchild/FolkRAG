Dear Dr. Putnam:

   We are glad to inform you that, at a 
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Corporation,
held on December 19, the following resolution
was adopted:
   RESOLVED, That, from the balance available
for appropriation, the sum of five thousand
five hundred dollars ($5,500) be, and it
hereby is, appropriated to the Library of 
Congress toward support of its program in 
the fine arts, previously aided under Resolution 
X 965.
   In making this sum available, the Committee
intended $2500 to be used for the photographs of early
Virginia architecture, and $3,000 for the purposes of
meeting the expenses of the campaign of Mr. Lomax and
his son in the South during the coming year.
   If you will let us know that these funds are 
acceptable to the Library of Congress, we shall be glad
to authorize payment.

Sincerely yours
F P Keppel
