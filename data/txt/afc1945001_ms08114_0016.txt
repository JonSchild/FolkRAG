Shoes Ration
Snoddy Man I'm worried to death.
Wife - About what?
Snoddy - Well! They know three pairs
of shoes a year
Wife - Why do that worry you
Snoddy - I can see where I can get
two pairs of shoes But I
don't see where I can get
enough money for the third 
pair.

When Hitler was bombing in London
Churchill told him you just like
hear you [?] get no where.

The people say that sugar ratining
So [?] until every time they
sweeten their coffee they say
give me liberty or a pound of
sugar.
