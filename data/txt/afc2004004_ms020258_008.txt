BEFORE THIS TIME ANOTHER YEAR

Before this time another year
I may be gone in some lonesome graveyard
O Lord how long?
God showed Noah - how long
The rainbow sign - how long
Sayin' no more water - how long
But fire next time - how long
Before this time another year
I may be gone in some lonesome graveyard
O Lord how long?

Then God telled Gabriel
Look behind the alter
Pick up your trumpet
And begin to blow it
I want you to blow it
The first [???] calm and easy
Wake up them children
They're down there sleepin'
Next thing I want you to blow it
Loud as thunder
Wake up them sinners
That are rollin' under
Before this time another year etc...

 Then God telled Gabriel
Look behind the alter
Pick up your trumpet
And begin to blow it
I want you to blow it
Before this time another year etc...
And I want you to blow it
At my command
One feet on the sea
One feet on the land
Before this time another year...

I want you to blow it
Calm andeasy
Wake up my children
Down there sleepin'
And I want you to blow it
Loud as thunder
Wake up them sinners
That are rollin' under
Before this time another year....
