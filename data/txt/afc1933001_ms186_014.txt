Grantwood, New Jersey

Dear Mrs. Jakobson:

Doctor Seeger informs me that he submitted 
your application with extremely favorable
comment to the American Council of Learned
Societies, but as you he has received no answer
from them. I believe the director, Doctor
Leland, has been away on vacation, but you should
expect to hear from them sometime very soon.

Have you gone forward with hour plans for
translation of part of your thesis into English?
It certainly should be available to American
workers in the field of folk lore. I suggest,
too, that you do an article on the subject and
submit it to Erminie Vogelin, Editor, American
Folklore Journal, Bloomington, Indiana.

Sincerely yours,
