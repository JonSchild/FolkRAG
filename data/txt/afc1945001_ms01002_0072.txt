By circulating all manner of contradictory rumors,
it is possible to so becloud issues and probabilities
that one's intentions can not be discerned.

Example:  Germany currently seems to be employing
rumor for precisely this purpose.  News reports
of late contain repeated references to the 
many diverse predictions of Germany's next move.
These come from Spain, Germany itself, Switzerland,
and elsewhere.  As a result many views are
not current, i.e., that she will take Spain,
that she will attempt an invasion of England,
that she intends to launch an offensive in the
Near East, etc.  Earlier in the war, this same
techniques proved effective in the Balkans, where 
conflicting rumors made Germany's intentions in
those countries indiscernible.

XIII.  How may employ rumor as propaganda?

It will be observed that all of the conditions predisposing 
a group to rumor are present today on the European
continent, particularly in the occupied contries.
We may note the complete distrust of the formal system
of communication in these countries, the intense wishes
and fears, and the enforced inactivity and oppression
in the occupied lands.  Now consider the problem of 
disseminating propaganda to these people.  We do not
have direct access to them  Our principal means of communication
are two, namely, radio and leaflets.  Both
of these can hope to reach only a small portion of the 
population.  It would seem, therefore,  that if we hope
for wide dissemination of our propaganda, we met utilize
so far as possible, the channels of rumor already 
established on the continent.  It is suggested, therefore 
that propaganda appeals to Europe be cast into a
form most readily communicated by rumor.
