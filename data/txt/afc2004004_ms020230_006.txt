BJ TAPE 16, p. 4

Spotted about, some be red -- Their hair red as these folks dye
their hair.  An' the skin jus' red lookin', jus' red lookin'.   But
them buggers could work.
         Looked like Creiles, Creoles, or sumpin'.   But they wasn't.
'Cause they didn't squeech up their eyes.  An' they didn't see
more at night than they did in the day.  But Mr. Carter say on his
side, on his father's side, there's several of 'em in his family,
that that way.   'Cause when the first one was bo'n, was, was Son.
An' that was, that was, that was the third chile, see?   An' folks
was sayin', aroun' the neighborhood there, ya know, "That sure ain't none
a [not] your chile; that [not] none a your chile!"
         He said, "Yes it is."  'Cause he know that run in they family,
the same way.   An' he had three of 'em, two girls an' one boy.
An' they, an' they was red.
AL:     Where were you the day this happened?
BJ:       I was right there in town.   Mama an' them had s-- had, ah,
had, sah, ah, tables down on the street there as they do when the
carnival come or a show come.  They let, they let 'em sell on the
street, know, sell to the peoples.   An' I wa' right there ta, ah, ta
Aunt Marg'ret's house, hum, hum, hum!   An' ah, an' when that
thing, wh-wh-when it happened?   Aunt Marg'ret says, "There's a
lion out or sumpin'. . ."   We didn' know what it was.   Like thunder
or sumpin' that [rolled] ro'd (ROARED).   An' all the dishes jus' rattled, an'
the glasses.   Man, that was a time! Because we, we were right near the
show grounds; not too far from the show ground.   An' [we] the people was fallin'
over one another an' runnin'?   Great Lawd.
         An' so, we thought it mighta been a elephant or sumpin' or
nother.   An' Aunt Marg'ret kept a-tellin' the folks wh-wh-what
run in her house, said, "That's a lion.   That's a lion."   An' so
[they knew] any how it was.  It was a lion.
