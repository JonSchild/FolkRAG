made more records that I am proud of since I have been in Hyden than 
I have during the whole of my stay in Kentucky and I shall continue 
to work here in Leslie County, probably the most backward county in 
the state until I have my fill of material. Then I shall get on to 
as many counties in the state as I have time for. The trouble is in 
covering this sort of country that one has to make friends of the people 
everywhere one goes and that takes time. They simply won't sing for you 
until they feel that you are friendly or that you are friends of friends 
of theirs.

I will need a new stock of records as fast as you can get them to me. 
I suppose you might as well send me a hundred % of the Express office in 
Hazard Ky. and ask them to notify the telephone operator here in Hyden as 
soon as they have arrived. I imagine that I shall be out of records by the 
time they arrive. Please send me also a number of Library franks 
so that I will have no trouble in shipping you my material.

It appears to me at this time that we will be disappointed in our 
aim of making three hundred records on this trip. Two hundred and 
fifty will be nearer the figure and this only if my present good luck holds 
[without too many breaks]. 

Thank you very much for the batteries and your continued interest 
in my work. I shall write you again in a few days and let you know how 
things are running. 

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
