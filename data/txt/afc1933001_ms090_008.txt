very uneasy about my Delco batteries,
which were drained of every
least bit of current - but this
morning they are not frozen - so
they're safe. Nobody need ever
scare me again about batteries
freezing!

I've had a terrible cold -
still here. We just remembered
about your experience with Dover's
powders- Orson is going to get
us some today. The negro girl
Odel - and her baby have
colds also.

In all the turmoil we
missed Alan's broadcast - worse
luck. I made a note of it on the
calendar, but had to be away when
it came around. i hope now
I can command my time occasionally
