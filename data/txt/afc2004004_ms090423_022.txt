in a song.

They was to try my case by four o'clock
They tried my case before Lot
They sent me to the farm and $25.00 fine
I told Lot to kiss my behind
Hard times, po' boy
Hard times, po' boy

Old Capt. Quinn I most all forgot
He's the meanest old white man we had in the lot
For $5.00 he'd run you right well
For $25.00 he'd run you to hell
Hard times, po' boy
Hard times, po' boy

When I was lying in Clarksdale jail
I seen a louse as long as a rail
Cut off his head nine feet from his tail
And still he was long as a ten foot rail
Hard times, po' boy
Hard times, po' boy

Old E.M.Eager, I most all forgot
He was the meanest white man we had on the lot
He'd put you on the farm without no bond
And you bound to work on Eager's farm
Hard times, po' boy
Hard times, po' boy

They wakes me up about four o'clock
They gim' me a piece of bread as hard as a rock
And a piece of meat as thin as a knife
That is a poor supper for prisoners at night
Hard times, po' boy
Hard times, po' boy

Every six months the accessioner comes round
To see how we is faring on this old farm
He wears a suit of navy blue
For 99 years the shackles on you
Hard times, po' boy
Hard times, po' boy. 30.
