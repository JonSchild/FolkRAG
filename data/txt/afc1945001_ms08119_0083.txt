[*A*]
A woman told me that a 
sailor on a train told
her that the sailors
are fed beans three
times a day at Navy
Pier.

A sergeant asked a 
group of privates which 
one of them was good
at shorthand. One 
private immediately
spoke up, and the 
sergeant said OK,
get busy peeling potatoes 
because
we're short-handed
on potato-peelers.
