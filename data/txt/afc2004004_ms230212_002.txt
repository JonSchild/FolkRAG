Work Songs Recorded on the Spot

[It appears that at least some of the items taped here
have been dealt with elsewhere by the translator.
However, many things seem clearer on this tape 
although some areas of uncertainty still are present.
Every effort is made to transcribe what is heard
on the tape or appears to be heard, even [every] where
the sense may not be obvious.  Translations are
done accordingly]
