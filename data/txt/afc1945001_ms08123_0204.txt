News to China

The mail that is sent to China, there is little room for newspapers, magazines, and books. Yet the Chinese are not only hungry for news and information from the United States, but they also are in need of science and technical developments. To supply them with these materials, the Library of Congress is micro-filming the pages of current events. On the hundred feet of film that weighs less than one pound, 1,600 pages of reading matter are photographed, and the microfilms sent 10,000 miles to the Chinese.
