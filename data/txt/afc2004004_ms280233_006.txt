The Cruel Ship's Captain:
1) A boy to me was bound apprentice
Because his parents they were poor.
So I took him from St. James' worjkhouse [workhouse]
All for to sail on the Greenland shore.
2) One day this poor boy he did annoy me,
Nothing to him then did I say,
But I rushed him to my frozen yard-arm,
And kept him there until the very next day.
