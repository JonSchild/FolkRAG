In the development of a continuing program there is a disadvantage
in using the word rumor too often. "Rumor" tends to dignify
what might be better designated in a deflating or ironic word - such
as "phony". Most rumors are phonies, and the flavor and pungency of the
word "phony" can serve as a potent weapon in fighting rumors.

It is valuable to point out, wherever possible, that certain
rumors are exactly like rumors which were also circulated (and were also
[proper term?] false) during World War I, the Franco-Prussian War, the Civil War, etc.
The project can help reduce anxiety about certain kinds of rumors 
(especially horror stories) by impressing people with the fact that (a)
certain rumors flourished in earlier wars and were just as phony then as 
now, (b) certain rumors always spring up during a war and have no basis
in fact.

It is dangerous to emphasize the role of Axis propaganda in rumors.
This heightens public uneasiness about the enemy - making people
think that the enemy is so subtle and successful in spreading rumors that
it is impossible to beat his propaganda. It may also encourage people to 
listen to Axis shortwave, under the delusion that "a lot of other people
must be listening to enemy propaganda if all these rumors are Axis-inspired."

Some rumors are made in Germany or Japan or Italy; most rumors 
spring up at home and spread at home. It is better to indicate that certain
rumors play into the hands of the enemy instead of suggesting that
rumors are invented and circulated by the enemy. The rumors which play
into the hands of the enemy are those which spread hatred or suspicion
among ourselves and which encourage defeatism or despair.
