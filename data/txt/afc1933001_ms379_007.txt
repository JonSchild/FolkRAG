"Got a man for you!"

An' Mister Sheriff call down de stair, "You do?" 
I ain't look up. I been studyin' dat jail house floor ---- 
an' it none too clean. But my ears is wide open, an' I hear 
Mister Sheriff say,

"Who [you] your man?"

Game ward man say, "I ain't know exactly. Let me get him 
up stairs an' we'll know."

An' I whoop out again, louder than ever. I been hope them 
white ladies'll hear.

An' us gone up dem dark jail house star step. That sure 
been a sad place. Even smell lonesome. An' I think about them 
chillun. An' I think about de Christmas. An' I can see Cindy 
cold naked foots.. And where my t[ter]obacco comin' from?

[[?]]Us reach de top an' come to a light an' a fire. An' 
by dat fire sit Mr. She[r]riff. Now I know de sheriff an' de 
sheriff know me. An' when he see who I was he say,

"Where [you]your man? Dat you Mike? Why if it ain't ole Mike 
Maybank! Mike, I is glad to git my hand on you! Come here."

An' den it was I see dat key. Dat been a long key. First 
jail house key I ever see. [It wasn't to be laugh at neither] An' I din't feel no pleasure to make acquaintance wid [the thing]it. 

[[?]]Den de door creak, [ ] an' I feel like I got to explain '
fore de door shut for good an' de sheriff gone on. So I 
bust out:

"De feller sent me dere, Mister Bullintine. I ain't know dat 
was de game ward man! You know me. You know I ain't want for 
to make no mistake like dat."

An' de sheriff, he say, "Mike, you stay right dere till I 
come."
