GOVERNOR

July 17, 1941

Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear Sir:

I have your letter of recent date asking 
information about a story you heard of a
negro, by name, Bessie Smith, having been
refused first aid at a hospital in my State.

I have made investigation and find that
the story is without foundation in fact.
We have five state owned charity hospitals
in Mississippi and no negro is refused
treatment. 50% of the population of my
State are negroes. I think if you will
write any leading negro in the State of
Mississippi he will tell you that the negroes
are certainly getting fair treatment in 
this State.

I am glad to have you bring this matter to
my attention and would be pleased to have
you make further investigation, and if you
find that there is any truth in the report
I will be glad to do whatever the facts
demand should be done.

Yours truly,
Paul B Johnson
Governor
