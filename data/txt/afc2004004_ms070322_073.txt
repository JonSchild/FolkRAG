usually fairly quiet no matter how
the sea roars outside.

The grey houses were empty for
a century  before the Maxwells made
them into plain summer tourist
accomodations. The story is that all
the men went out in a boat fishing
& the sea took the lot in one
green cat's paw & tucked them in
under. Then the women moved away
taking their children & cattle over
the green hill, up the lane & leaving
the grey stone barns & house empty.

I imagine something different, but
a dark, quiet, thick night, a
great quiet green wave came rolling
in past the shoulders of the cliff,
[sucked the houses] filled the street,
rose over the top windows & sucked
out the people the way we
suck the marrow from a bone
