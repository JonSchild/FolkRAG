Lomax: Well, who was at fault in the song?
Joe: Well, I couldn't say what was his side and what was her side.
You can't tell, can you?
Lomax: You don't know how the quarrel actually began?
Joe: No, I don't.
Lomax: But it seems to me she was an awful hard-hearted woman.
Joe: Why, of course she was. Certainly so.
Lomax: Maybe she was too rpoud, or something.
Joe: Something like that, yes.

if he knows various songs, without success. Then straight into song. . .
1) . . .And thinking that no one could harm her
She'd often been that way before.
2) One day she met with a highwayman, his pistol he drew to her breast
Saying, "Deliver your money, your clothing, or you will shout high in distress.
3) He stripped this fair damsel stark naked, and gave her the reins for to hold,
And there she stood shivering and shaking, all starving to death with the cold.
4) She put her left foot in the stirrup, and saddled the horse like a man,
Over hedges and ditches she galloped, crying, "Catch me, you rogue if you can."
5) The rogue he quickly followed after, which caused him to puff and to blow,
And finding that he couldnot overtake her, she rode to her father's own door.
6) O daughter, o daughter, wherever hast thou been, thou've been to market so long,
O father I've been in great danger, but the rogue he has done me no harm.
7) She put the grey horse in the stable; she gave him some corn and some hay,
And there she sat counting her money from midnight till daylight next day.
