before the drums, he [kisses the earth] similarly salutes the 
center post  of the tonnelle or palm leaf shed where the dances
usually take place, The 
"poto mitans". I rather incline to the opinion that 
neither "poto mitans" nor ["huntah"] "hounta" are names of spirits or any thing 
of that sort, but rather the names of places or things or the "essence" of 
places or things which are of great ritual [importance and where the gods
continually congregate] and psychological importance.

I am afraid that this letter, despite its length, does 
not answer your question. [Probably if you wrote to] Letters to Melville Herskovitz, 
to Katherine Denham University of Chicago, ([who] whom, I have been informed, knows vaudou in Haiti perhaps more 
intimately than any student of anthropology in [the] this country),
to Zora Neale Hurston (who is at present at work in Haiti), and 
to Dr. Reiser, Pont Beudet, Haiti, (who can tell you if he will), 
might clear up the problem entirely.  At any rate, I hope I have 
been of some assistance.

Sincerely yours,
