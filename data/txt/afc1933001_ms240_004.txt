Mr. John A. Lomax

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am wondering what happened to you. We were looking
for you over the week end and were very much disappointed
not to see you. I hope your plans have not been changed in
such a way that will prevent you from coming to Meadville.
I neglected to say that if you have Mrs. Lomax with you or
if Allan is along, we will be glad to entertain them too.
I hope your coming has just been delayed and that we will
see you in a few days.

With best regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
John R. Schultz
J.R. Schultz

JRS: ps

You taught his classes while
he drove me through zero
weather for a lecture and
do you remember how they took
us out of the cold into the comforts
of a home? Write him and
send him some printed stuff about
the Archive.  F.
