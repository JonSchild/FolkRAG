     Let us our lamps prepare,
To meet when the last trump shall blow,
     And in His glory share.

So, fare you well, my brethren dear,
     With melting hearts we part;
God make you faithful to the end,
     Your souls lie near my heart.

We need not wait but few more days,
     Then He will call us home,
Where fear of parting ne'er will come,
     In that bright world above.

Where we'll surround the throne of God,
     And sing redeeming love;
And there I hope to see your face,
     And join to praise the Lord.

No. 46

My head and stay is called away,
     And I am left alone;
My husband dear, who was so near,
     Is fled and gone away.

     It breaks my heart, 'tis hard to part
          With one who was so kind;
     Where shall I go to vent my smart,
          Or ease my troubled mind?

In wisdom's ways we spent our days,
     Much comfort we did find;
But he is gone, in dust he lays,
     And I am left behind.

          Naught can I find to ease my mind,
          In things which are below;
     For earthly toys but vex my joys,
          And aggravate my woe.
