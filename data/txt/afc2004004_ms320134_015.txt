CAJUNS-LOMAX  -14

played on a washboard hung around the neck.  A different
thing from the Cajun orchestra which of course is generally
a fiddle in the lee, lead, with an accordian accompanyment.
That's typically European just as the, as the wind with
percussion in a hot relationship is the African one.  And
we, you know, here we can get the two kinds of music in if
you, you know.
     So we come to a, the beginning of our story
which is the fact that when the Cajuns moved into the
praries they had black neighbors.  There were slaves early
of course, and some of them owned slaves.  There were three
people of color who had big plants, who owned big ranches,
too.  And in this log of, of the brands of the Cajun country
some of the names alongside of these brands were names of
black creoles and Cajuns who had cattle ranches.
     They lived in this strange kind of southern
Louisiana relationship where they both went to the same
church and, and worshiped side by side.  There was  a code
noir which regulated the severity of punishment for black
slaves.  And there were conditions by means of which a
person could work himself out of slavery.  There were many
marriages between the two, much mixing of blood.
     And then suddenly the Civil War came --
changed everything because the Cajuns didn't feel they had
very much stake in this, in this, in the southern side.
