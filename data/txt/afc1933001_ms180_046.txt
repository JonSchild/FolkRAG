Dear Mr. Lomax:

I'm back again!

I noticed that you have compiled some folk songs to be presented at the 
Music Educators' Conference, and it occurred to me you might be 
heading the drive to replace American folk songs for the European folk 
songs now included in school childrens' song books. This strikes me as 
such an interesting story for an audience such as ours that I hope I'm 
correct in assuming this.  If you're not the one who's doing the replacing-- 
who is; how is it to be carried out; when will the ball start rolling and what and when the will the first results be?

Have you projected any trips into the mountain country in the future? I'm
still anxious to get that picture I mentioned to you. It would be very 
dramatic and interesting to everyone. Let me hear from you soon about the replacement of European folk songs and about your own plans for a trip. 

Sincerely yours,

Eleanor Stierhem
