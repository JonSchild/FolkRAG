Rumor: One of our operators repeated to me a story told her by one of her
patrons, age 45. The patron's son was home on leave from the Navy
and was surprised to find his home noticing a scarcity of meat and
he  repeated how the Navy that week had thrown overboard seven tons
of meat spoiled because not needed.
