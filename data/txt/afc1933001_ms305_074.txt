'BOG TROTTERS'
ON AIR TODAY

Southwest Musicians to Be
Heard on Network

All America today will hear Roanoke's
radio station WDBJ and a
group of Southwest Virginia's typical
mountain musicians in Southwest
Virginia's typical music when
the "Bog Trotters" of Galax go on
the air over the Columbia Broadcasting
System's American School
of the Air to the nation's school
children.

The local studios yesterday were
busy all day long with preparing
the rehearsing for the broadcast,
biggest network job ever undertaken
here. William Fineshriber, Columbia's
director of the Folk Music of
America series on the air school,
is here to produce the show, and
the nation will be held by Paul
Reynolds, studio director and announcer
of WDBJ, that "Today's
program was produced and directed
by William Fineshriber in collaboration
with Jack Weldon, program
director of WDBJ." Mr. Reynolds
also has assisted with the
production of the program, and will
handle the announcing.

Old Tunes And Stories

Uncle Alec Dunford, Dr. W. P.
Davis, and the Ward family (Uncle
Crockett, Fields, and Wade) will
give the school children of the nation
an insight into the way Virginia's
mountain folk entertain
themselves today, presenting some
of the finest of the old square dance
tunes just as they are played at a
square dance, and telling some of
the old stories that give the square
dancers a breathing spell.

Alan Lomax, folk musician for
the CBS series and assistant in
charge of the Archive of American
Folk Music of the Library of Congress,
will be commentator on the
program.

Tunes the "Bog Trotters" will play
today are: "Cindy," "Hop Up, My
Ladies," "Foxchase" (banjo and
guitar), "Western Country or Suzannah
Gal," "Fortune" (a reel), "Old
Joe Clark," "Arkansas Traveller,"
and "Cackling Hen."

The broadcast will be given twice
over WDBJ today. The first at 9:15
to 9:45 a.m., will go to the eastern 
and central parts of the nation, and
the second, 3:35 to 4:00 p.m., to
the west.

The folk music series has proved
one of the most successful on the
School of the Air, with highly
encouraging comments in letters
from children and their teachers,
Mr. Fineshriber said last night.

On most of the broadcasts in the
series, a brief symphonic composition
based on some folk tune is
played by the Columbia Symphony
orchestra, though none is to be used
on the program today. This is
designed to give children a "gentle
introduction to the horrors of the
symphony," Mr. Fineshriber said,
teaching them to look for the themes
in symphonic compositions, and in
this has been gratifyingly successful,
he indicated.
