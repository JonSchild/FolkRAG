Now everybody who has ever lived in America, breathed her
expanding air has either heard or indulged in the national 
practice of tall talking, exaggeration, lying fo r fun....
We are a nation of promoters. We love to rave about our iceboxes
and our glaciers, our patent electric stoves and
our geysers.... The folk lorist of the future will be
able to look back on all this and sift out the typical and
the important, but in our generation we can best find the folk
lore of the places in society we have just left. We can tell
what's juicy about the tall talk of the cowboys, lumberjacks,
picturesque mountaineers, the farmers, etc...Mark Twain drank deep
here. Davy Crockett, Mike Fink, John Henry, J.P. Morgan, Jim Fiske...
Now men have liked to stand around country stores and hitch their
suspenders up and lie. It consoles a man to lie when he's ggot
a hard job to do and wants to feel big enpugh fpr the job.
They like to lie about how fertile the land is....

The field of cucumbers that was so rich that before
they could get across it, their pockets had filled up
with cucumbers.

The old mule died and we buried him 
and the next morninghe'd done sprouted little jackasses.

Two brothers walking through the fields planting corn
and it was growing so fast that one brother sent the other one
back to push the corn back in the growing stunt it. Afraid it
would all turn into fodder the next day....Didn't see his brother
no more , couldn't find him. What'd happened. Well he went walking
through the fields and a note came fluttering down by him
said, "Dear brother, am well and hope you the same. Just passed 
through heaven at eight o'clock last night selling roastn' ears
to the angels.......
