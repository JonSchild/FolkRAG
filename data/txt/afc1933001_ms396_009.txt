you see, an' sticks 'em mongst de coals an' ashes, an' covers 'em up wid de emmels. Den I leans my haid on de back ob my cheer and tries to sleep. Well, I wuz sorta nappin' 'long noddin' an' bowin', till I lastly did fall asleep.
           "Long way in de night I wakes up an' looks aroun' de room. All de mens wuz settin' back in dere cheers, noddin' an' bowin'. De wimmins wuz huddled close togedder on de flo', kivered up wid dat ragged quilt. Dey wuz all sleepin'. Dat daid man he uz jes' layin' over dere in de corner on de coolin' board, wid de white rag wrop aroun' his jaws. 
            ""Clear Rock', I says, ' 'Spec dem yams' yo's is done." SO I rakes 'roun' 'mongst de emmels an' takes out one o' dem yams. You know, when you cooks a young yam pertater, it gives up its juice, and de ashes is stuck all over iy. So I took my foot an' whacks de yam agin' it, - Whock, whock, wock! DEN de man what wuz dead, layin' over in de corner by de side o' de wall on his coolin' board wid his jaws all wrop up wid a white rug, he raise up an' say:
       'Is dey done?'
An' I says, 'I don' know whedder dey is done or not, but I'S done wid dis place." De do' wuz too far, so I makes my way outa de winder. As I wuz precedin' up de big road, I pass by one o' dem Dutchman school houses where dey wuz practicin' music fur one o' dem sixteens or sumpin'. 'Bout de time I went by dat house, one o' dem mens poked a big brass ho'n outa de winder on de side where I wuz at an' blowed: 'da-ti-da-tee-da-da- (imitation of 'taps')-. I wuzn't espectin' anything like dat, an' I leaned over; -- an' when I riz up, I wuz in Ardmore, Oklahoma. My eyes wuz stickin' out an ' shinin' like a spy light on a locomobile. I quz goin' so fast when I crossed de T.O. tracks in Fo't Wo'th dat my shirt-tail ketch afire an'made me run a little faster. Dat's what you call runnin' yo'sef los'. Befo' I could pertec myself, I had run fum Bastrop, Texas clean up inter OKlahoma."
