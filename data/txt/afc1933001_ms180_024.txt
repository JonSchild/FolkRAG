Dear Mr. Clauuch:

The Archive of American Folk Song is planning
to make up a group of the best representative
American folk songs to be distributed in Latin
America. Among the records we hope to use are
your performances of "Grub Springs", "The Eighth
of January", "Sally Goodin" and "Cindy" which
you recorded for Mr. Herbert Halpert some time
ago. We will pay you $15.00 for the use of these
fiddle tunes and will send you two copies of the 
record.

I hope you will give us your permissions to use
these tunes by signing and returning the enclosed
form as soon as possible. All the records will 
carry the legend, "For non-commercial use only"
and, of course, your name will appear on every
copy.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Son
