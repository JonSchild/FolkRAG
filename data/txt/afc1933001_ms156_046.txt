Mr. Allen Lomax,

Washington, D. C. 

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I have not forgotten my promise to put you
in touch with some singers of rare old ballads when you are 
in position to visit our section of the country and trust
you will give me a few days time to get them "rounded up"
so to speak before you come.  You understand I have the songs 
but I am no singer, altho' I am in touch with people who live
in the mountains around in the Big Sandy district where I was 
born and raised and where my relatives still live, who are the 
"real thing".

I wonder if you have any of these ballads in 
you varied collection.

"The Ducking Stool"  (No doubt you are familiar
with this old custom about which this song centers.)

"The Gay Young Troubadour"
"Frog in a Bottle"  (Concerning an old mountain tale)
"Great Fire of London" (fire of 1666)
"The Minstrel Lad") Dating back to the days of the 
Percy's and Douglas' and King Henryiv)
"Lady Jane Grey" Tells the sad story of her short 
reign and her subsequent fate)
"King's Evil"  (Dealing with the old superstition in 
English history that Edward the Conqueror was able to cure "Kings
Evil" or in other words scrofula, by a touch.)
"The Irish Keener" (relating to the custom of the 
Irish in hiring mourners or keeners as they were called for wakes)
"The Banshee's Wail" (another Irish custom)

Trusting to have the pleasure of meeting you soon,
I am 

Sincerely yours,
B. Jones
