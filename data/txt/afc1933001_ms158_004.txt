My dear Mr. Allen:

Your letter finally reached me and I am so glad to hear you are
interested in my idea for a folk music festival in the Municipal
Auditorium, for I feel there are great possibilities here.

I am writing you in response to information I received from Edith
Little Ofterdahl, who is now residing here.

Charleston, West Va., is a city of approximately 75,000, a great
many of whom are interested in civic music and May Festivals, but
to date there is no organized effort to encourage Folk Songs and
dances. We have a new Municipal Auditorium seating 3,500, with a 
back stage that will seat 1,500, and this is used as a small auditorium
or for additional seats for conventions, etc., when room for 
5,000 is needed. The seats on the back stage are folding chairs,
and Mrs. Ofterdahl said that the size and arrangement would make it
possible for you to put on the type of program you arranged at the
Forrest Theatre.

A local group of which Mrs. Ofterdahl is a member, is already meeting
regularly, and this group with, perhaps, Aunt Mollie Jackson,
Wood Guthrie, Margo Mayo, Lead Billy, under your direction, could
undoubtedly put on a program that would be very popular. I hope this
would result in the demand for organization of many such groups
throughout the city.

The local broadcasting stations have offered their facilities. Does
this type of program interest you? Do you think we have the means of 
making it successful? What would be the charges for your services
and for those with you?

I should appreciate your reply as I am anxious to make some plans
along this line.

Yours very truly,
Betty Heavener
Mrs. C. Paul Heavener
Director of Recreation
