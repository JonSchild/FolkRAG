TAPE 60. MICHAEL CRONIN:
(Golden-Haired Lad. See Tape 59)
I Can't Change It.
1) I know a lot of lazy men, I meet them when I may,
They never have a penny, always stony broke, they say.
With me it's just the other way, for I'm a man of bliss,
I'M ne'er without a shilling in my pocket, - Here it is.
Chorus:
But I can't change it, I can't change it,
The reason why I'll let you know.
It's one I made myself, and so,
I can't change it, I don't intend to try,
But I hope I'll have it in the sweet by and by.

2) I never was a proud young man, as any man can see,
For fashions I don't care about, nor clothes don't trouble me.
I never was a smasher, I'm satisfied to know,
I've one shirt upon my back, I can't say that.
Cho:
I can't change it. (2)
I've got one shirt upon me back,
It fits me like a blooming sack,
I can't change it, I don't intend to try,
For I'll get it changed to linen in the sweet by and by.

3) I thought I would get married like a lot of foolish men,
I found a girl, we bought a ring, got married there and then.
But when the job was over, I was taken down a peg,
Her hair, her eyes, her teeth were false, and she had a wooden leg,
Cho:
I can't change her. (2)
What a great surprise to me, half a woman and half a tree,
But I can't change her, I don't intend to try,
But I'll chop her up for firewood in the sweet by and by.

4) When I came home this afternoon the nurse was at the door,
She said, "You've got another, which makes it half a score."
She's just a pretty little thing, I'd like to wish you joy,
Sure I wish her woe, for what I wanted was a boy.
But I can't change her, (2)
I asked a lot who ought to know,
I asked the nurse and she said no,
You can't change her, you don't intend to try,
But I hope she'll have a dozen in the sweet by and by.
