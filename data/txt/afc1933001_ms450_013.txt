When the tourist boats and the
tourist places [come in] dock in Nassau, they are met [at]
[the dock by] by one or several of the
town's street bands. These bands (banjo;
one or two guitars, mandolin & rattle)
sing and play Bahaman versions of American
jazz tunes of ancient vintage and fresh,
improvised, hot arrangements eg Bahaman
folk-dance tunes. [Certainly] At night they
go over the hill and improvise even hotter
arrangements for the "round-dances" - fox-trots,
one-steps, etc. -- which have recently become
[the ?] increasingly popular in the islands.
The following tunes, examples of this "sophisticated"
genre, are signposts of future development in
Bahaman folk music.
