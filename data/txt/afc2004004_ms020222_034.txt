BJ:  I like that because it's wonderful, you know.  You got a
right, to the tree of life.
     There's another ol' song. . .I can't. . .Oh, Lawd, this is
won'erful, too.  They used to sing this an' shout.  Oh, an'
I did, too, hah!  An' I does now, an' I also does now.  Well, here's
the point about this song:  That was 'way back.  Years ago.  And I
would leave the church, I have left the church 'long with the
Sunday school, an' church chilren, you know.  We had to go on
Sunday school then an' stay until meeting's over, ya know?  An',
we'd go home.  An', [like that] ah, but I have been walkin' along the road
an' no one knowed it but myse'f, playin' among chilren, in my
mind sayin' that [those] them peoples is tellin' a lie.  You know, I
wouldn't say a lie, but I say they tellin' a story?  'Cause they
knew they don't hear nothin' over they haid.  Ya see?  They ain't
nothin' over there.  I look up in the element an' see if they
ain't nothin' over they haid.
     An' you know, long years come to pass an' radios come out,
ya see.  All those diffrunt things come out.  I was playin'
the radio once in the house.  The man, you know, pronounceded
where he was at, you know.  An' was in Macon, Georgia at that time,
but I was yet back up in Georgia.  You know, down home, I reckon
hundreds of miles from the place, you know?  But that thought
come right back to me again!  God brought it right back to me.
Say, "You see, the same music then, ah now, was in the air then."
That man was not lyin'.  The peo -- the peoples was not lyin', see?
That music was above they haids.  But we jus' couldn't hear it.
We didn't have the, the, the equipments to hear it.  The same
singing, the same thing what was goin' on, ya see, was jus'
wasn' fixed where you could hear it from do' to do'.  So
