The next time I left New Orleans, I met Harry Dunn, who was considered
one of the best Georgia Skin players in Alabama.  Somehow, he
liked music and taken a liking to me.  He told me, "Someday I'm going to
make a gambler out of you."  And of course, that started me because I
wanted to have the other fellows in my class beat.  He used to teach me 
day by day when he wouldn't go out to meet a pay day.  When he said he
was going to meet a pay day, he meant he was going to bring the bacon
home -- win all the money from the people who worked.  When the turpentine
men would come into one of these co-called towns along the coast, they
would always start gambling and Georgia Skin was no doublt the main game.
Of all the games in history that I've seen, I never seen one game for so
many different kinds of cheats right in front of your eyes.  And it would
take magician to catch Harry and maybe he couldn't even catch him.

Well, Harry taught me a few things about Georgia Skin, and so once
when he was going to make a pay-day at Orange, Mississippi, he took me
along as-his little brother, he called me.  He knew I had good relatives
and that I kept a little money by being able to play in sporting houses.
So, he told me, said," I want you to see how these things is done, because
showing you without the actual experience, you wouldn't be able to 
do it."

Orange, I din't see anything in Orange at all, but the log camp and 
two or three little houses.  But they were playing GeorgianSkin in every
one of them and pretty soon Harry was in the turpentine money up to his
elbows.  This encouraged me to try one of those tricks Harry had taught me,
so I got three jacks in my hand and when the last jack fell, I told the
boys to get down -- meaning bet.  They got down heavy and it wasn't long till
