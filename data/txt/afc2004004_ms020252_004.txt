2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 13

ROLL ON, SWEET MOMENTS, ROLL ON

Roll on, sweet moments, roll on, (2)
Roll on 'till my laborin' is done,
And then I'll be sentenced to my home.

CHORUS:
Roll on,
Roll on,
Roll on, sweet moments, roll on,
Roll on,
Roll on,
Until I be sentenced to my home.               

Pray on, sweet children, pray on, (2)
Pray on 'till your laborin' is done,
And then you'll be sentenced to your home.

Preach on, brother preachers, preach on, etc.                                                                                 (CHORUS)
