Dear Mr. Lomax,
Mr. John Umble of Goshen College tells me 
that you have some phonograph recordings of the 
songs sung by the Old Order Amish Churches of this 
community. Would it be possible for me to hear 
and study these records? I am a student in the 
School of Sacred Music at Union Theological Seminary 
in New York City. As part of my work for my Master's 
degree I am writing a thesis on "Music Among the 
Mennonites of America," and for this paper your 
records of the Amish songs would be invaluable 
source material.

Would it be possible for me to hear them on Tuesday 
Wednesday or Thursday of next week, on the 20th to 
22nd of September? If not at that time, when would 
it be possible?

Thanking you in advance for your favor, I am
Yours very truly,
Samuel T. Burkhard
