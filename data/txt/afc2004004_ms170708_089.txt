7.
At seventeen I took a wife,
An' I loved her dearly as I loved my life;
All for to keep her both fine an' gay,
A-robbin' I went on the King's highway.

I robbed Lord Goldin' I do declare,
And Lady Mansfield in Grosvenor Square,
I robbed them of their gold so bright,
And I took it home to my heart's delight.

To Convent Gardens we went straitway,
Me an' my wife we went to the play.
Ned Fieldin's gang there did me pursue,
Taken I was by that cursed crew.

My father cried, "I am undone."
My mother cried for her darling son.
My pretty damsel she tore her hair,
Saying, "What shall I do, for I am in despair."

Now when I'm dead an' go to my grave,
A decent funeral let me have.
Six highwaymen for to carry me,
Give them broadswords and sweet liberty.
