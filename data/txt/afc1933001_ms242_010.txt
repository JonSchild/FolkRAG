So - I do not 
wish you to put Bess
Brown into C.I.O. work
e. I have told Bess Brown
that I would come on to
Washington and try to help
see her located in a job
if this course appears
necessary. I am ready
to start any day. "I've 
done my darnedest" on
three of my children. When
Bess is settled, "free, white
and 21," my job will be 
done. In her case I
hope you will help 
me. Lovingly,
Father
