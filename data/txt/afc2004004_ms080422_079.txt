[*Death of Dad*]
some milk in it, your daddy wants some fresh milk. And
she took that milk back in and give it to him, and well, he
drink that milk and he never said another word. Next morning, 
she said wake your daddy up, I'm fixing some breakfast now.
I went over and looked at him, and I walked back over and I
said, mommy, I said, Dad's died. She said, no, I said, yeah,
he's died. I can tell. And one of my brothers, he walked 
over and looked at him, said, yeah, he's died. He just 
never said a word and in five minutes he was dead. Never
breathed no more. Just went that easy. Never groaned, never 
nothing. Went off easy.
AL: You have a song about that don't you, Oh Death. Maybe 
that's what keeps youall going, you know the [?] song.
(Phyllis and Nimrod start singing together, doesn't work, then
they each sing their version. ) END 894
[*BEGIN #895*]
AL: Where on earth does that song come from anyway, did you
grow up knowing it?
Nimrod: Yeah, way back, for years, sing that song. It's an old
one.
Phyllis: Oh, the devil and the farmer song? [(She sings)]
He used to do a lot of those verses, then when I got older, ther
were a couple more verses that I just learned.
Nimrod: Oh, I learned it way back when I was a boy. Old uncle
Peter Mc Neary, he sang that song, he was one of them old timers
