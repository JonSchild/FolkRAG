Since Child's volumes are so important, then, it will 
be interesting to discover what his point of view was. He
did not agree with Grimm and Gruntvig that ballads were
the result of popular composition, "still the author counts
for nothing, and it is not by mere accident, but with the
best reason, that they (the ballads) have come down to us
anonymous.... They date from the middle ages and have 
become popular through being  accepted and traditionally 
transmitted by a people in which there is such community of
feelings that the whole people form an individual. Thus 
many ballads of the now most refined nations had their origin
in the upper class though they have now sunk down to be the
cherished possession of the commonality." In these statements*
are compounded practically all we know of Child's
point of view - he must have been either modest, busy, or 
unable to generalize, - and yet he must have had some criteria
for distinguishing the popular ballads among all the 
thousands of texts he turned over. I suspect that these 
criteria were largely psychic and intuitional,  a residue
of taste and aesthetic judgement left over from his perusal
of ballad books and therefore a crystallization of 
their predilections.

F.B. Gummere, the loudest and most effective voice 
among English scholars interested in poetic origins, felt 
this lack of positive criteria for the identification of
