WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE RUMOR 
REPEATED ONLY EIGHT TIMES-
UNLESS YOU STOP IT, A RUMOR CAN BE
REPEATED 50,000 TIMES IN A DAY,

AS RUMOR BEGAN
400 planes are on the Naga-
saki island off Panama and 
they are expected to bomb
the republic of Panama within 
12 days unless the Germans
are called off by the Japs 
who intend to put the Panama
canal out of order.

AFTER 10 TELLINGS NO RELATION TO ORIGINAL RUMOR OR TO TRUTH
400 Japanese planes are going to bomb the Panama Canal and the Germans will work with them to wreck the canal.

TRY IT WITH A MEANINGLESS
RUMOR WITH 10,20, OR 30
OF YOUR OWN FRIENDS.
