is simple.  This is but another of the many rumors
making repeated rounds, usually told by somebody to somebody
else, and, of course, the source of the story is
always believed to be a 'reliable authority.'"

Rumors also serve to reenforce divisionist attitudes.  There
are the persistent anti-Negro rumors.  The press has already discussed
the prevalence of the Eleanor club rumors and it may be interesting
to note that in spite of the wide-spread [devices] exposés, there is still considerable 
talk about these "organizations."  We also learn in city after city
that Negroes have purchased all the ice picks, all the knives, in preparation 
for race riots.  Communities are being armed, air-raid wardens
are being warned about violence to be expected in the next blackout.
[*no ¶*] The anti-Sem[e]itic rumors continue to develop.  "Jews are evading
the draft."  The crop of anti-Government rumors, anti-allied rumors all
serve the same purpose.  They divide us and prevent the full-fledged
cooperation so necessary for a United Nations' victory.
The wish rumors described above, while they reflect certain
character traits, are also potent as weapons.  The complacency they induce
obstructs the war effort at times as much as deliberate sabotage.
"Rationing is unnecessary."  "We will all have synthetic tires soon."
"The salvage campaigns are just designed to make us war conscious.  They
are not really needed."  "The war will soon be over."  All of these get
in the way.

The seriousness of the problem of rumor as described above naturally gives rise
to considering the need for counteraction.  Thus far, only a few tentative steps
have been taken specifically in this direction.  The rumor clinic 
column in Boston has been copie[s]d elsewhere.  There are general anti-rumor 
campaigns, but the problem of meeting specific rumors requires
careful consideration.
