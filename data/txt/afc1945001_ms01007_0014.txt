Lilienthal Warns State May Lose Aluminum Plant
Says Carrol Land Set Too High as McKellar Raps Purchase System
By J. LACEY REYNOLDS
From Washington Bureau 
WASHINGTON, March 19.—TVA Chairman David E. Lilienthal bluntly warned today that if Car-roll County landowners "continue to hold such elevated ideas" about the value of their clay land, the $30,000,000 aluminum plant which may be located there will be moved to Alabama.
The warning was sounded in re-sponse to criticism by Sen. Kenneth D. McKellar of Tennessee that TVA was not giving landowners on whose farms boring were made sufficient information about the results of the borings. 
Offer Said Hiked Five Times 
The senator read into the record of a senate agriculture subcommit-tee a letter from a Carroll County landowner complaining that TVA had offered him at first $20,000 and finally "only $100,000 for the land.
TVA has been making boring of clay deposits in West Tennes-see and Alabama in connection with final experimentation on its new process to extract aluminum from clay. 
The senator said he felt TVA should take the landowner into its confidence after he had "extended TVA the courtesy" or taking the borings. 
Speculation Guard Claimed
"I don't see why the federal gov-ernment should stimulate speculative endeavor," Lilienthal replied.
"It is the duty of the TVA to deal fairly with the citizens," Mc-Kellar added. 
"I want the federal government to deal fairly with all its citizens, including the taxpayers who must pay the bill for this land," Lilien-thal retorted. 
Senator George Aiken (R., Va.), a member of the subcommittee, asked Lilienthal whether the Alum-inum Company of American might not become interested in these deposits. 
"All that the eye sees is not found in this case," Lilienthal an-swered, asserting that negotiations over clay land and experiments with the new process are "a very delicate matter."
Opposed to Monopolies
McKellar said he was "opposed to monopoly of all kinds," but asked the TVA chairman whether it was true that the Aluminum Company has reduced the cost of aluminum to the government.
Lilienthal said this was true, and added that he did not believe this the time "to be digging at any-body." Continuing his attack on TVA, McKellar asked, "What right has TVA to go into the aluminum business?" 
The authority has no legal right to enter the business, Lilienthal said, but does have power to make investigations such as those with the aluminum process. 
Says Land Undervalued 
The senator also placed in the record a letter from a complaining landowner at Spring City, who wrote that "$8-a-day witnesses" which inspected his farm for TVA's land-condemnation commis-sion had undervalued it.
William C. Fitts, Jr., general counsel for the Tennessee Valley Authority, told the committee that proposed changes in the authority's land condemnation procedure would work to the benefit of "large land-owners and contingent-fee law-yers." 
"He testified in opposition to Mc-Kellar's bill which would transfer land valuation cases from an im-partial court-appointed commission to juries of local citizens.
If the measure were enacted, he predicted "that small fringe of am-bulance chasing lawyers would turn (Continued on Page 10, Column 3) 
Sergt. York Says: 
Pall Mall, Tenn., March 19 — When the news came of General MacArthur reaching Australia and being put into command of the Allied forces fighting the Japs, it was like finding a sudden fortune. Most Americans would have been pray-ing it would happen but were most afraid to hope. 
MacArthur's one Allied general who's been able to make the lint and buttons fly off the Japs. I'll bet there's cold shivers shaking Tokyo right now. The confidence our fighting men  have in this fighting general is worth divisions of troops and flocks of planes.
Being the breed of man he is, MacArthur must have hated to leave his outfit—but he'll still be their commander and they'll have every benefit of that. But  he's not only needed in one corner of the war—he's needed all over. He may be just hte leader to slam the Japs back, and the sooner they give ground anywhere, the quicker his boys on Bataan can be relieved.

$1,000 Reward Offered For Letter Everybody's Read 
Story of Letter to Mother From Son Captured In Japan Spreads Like Wildfire—Try To Find It 
REWARD: The tennessean offers $1,000 (one thousand dollars) reward to the person who will produce an authentic letter written by a Nashville boy to his mother from a Japanese prison camp with a secret message written beneath the stamp of the letter. 
This story is not a news story. A news story is written about something that is not generally known. In fact, the purpose of a news story is to tell people something they hadn't already heard. 
But everybody in Nashville already knows about this letter. That is, practically everybody knows. And so do people in nearby towns. And so do people in Detroit and people in Washington, D. C.—at least two people in Wash-ington know about it and, therefore, we presume the people there have been as quick to spread it as have the people of Nashville. 
Blood-Curdling, Horror Story
It is a macabre story, a blood-curdling story, a horror story. It is the kind of story people sometimes say they can't understand why a newspaper prints. 
It is the kind of story that makes you shudder when you first hear it. You say to yourself, "I won't tell that story to anybody. It's too terrible." And you don't tell anybody—for at least a little while. Then you go to the grocery and are chatting with the grocer about what the war's doing to prices, whether there's really any rea-son for this sugar rationing etc., etc., and the story comes to mind and you tell the grocer. 
Just Too Big a Story to Kee
Or you go to the bridge club and the story just occurs to you. And since it was told to you by a close friend of the person who lives right down the street from the mother of the boy, why you just feel it's too big a story to keep. 
And you, Mr. Man—you heard the story, too, and you didn't intend to repeat it, either, bbut there you are at the barber shop and the man in teh next chair has just told something he heard about what happened at pearl Harbor and his story is not nearly as big as this one, so you tell it. Why not? If you don't tell it, somebody else will. Did it ever occur to you who started the story? Did you stop for one instant to think you ab-surd it was—how impossible for such a letter to get out of Japan, let alone be delivered in this coun-try? 
We're sure a lot of people thought of that and the story stopped with them. But too many people didn't think before they talked, and as a result, they've spread the horriblly ridiculous story from one end of this town to another. And we have good reason to believe, from one end of the country to another. 
Hence this story, which is not a news story. Or, more accurately, it is a news story in reverse. It is 
"In the absence of all the facts, as revealed by official sources, you have no right to deal out uncon-firmed reports in such a way as to make people believe they are Gospel truth. Every citizen, in every walk of life, shares this same responsibility." 
—President Roosevelt. 
designed to tell you, not that something happened, but that it didn't. 
Heard in Bus Conversation
For more than a week we've been hearing the story. First, a reporter for The Tennessean heard it on a bus. The lady who told her lady friend explained she had heard it from a neighbor. Wasn't it hor-rible such a thing could happen, she said to her friend. 
The reporter wasn't supposed to go to work for another hour yet. He didn't have to get getting stories,

Woman Admits Trunk Murder
Pretty Atlantan's Slayer Says Victim Vamped Son-in-Law
ATLANTA, March 19.—(AP)—A 46-year-old housewife tonight sobbed out a confession to the slay-ing of a pretty, young salesgirl to end Atlanta's two-day old trunk murder mystery.
Detective Superintendent J. A. McKibben said Mrs. Minnie Lee Griffin admitted the slaying of Mrs. Mildred Seymour Williams, 22, whose battered and trussed body was found late yesterday in an old automobile trunk in the basement of the Griffin home.
Confession Signed 
The middle-aged woman, elft alone in her cell throughout the day, signed a confession to the gruesome crime, McKibben said, shortly after he started question-ing her tonight. She, with three men, including two of her sons, had been detained since shortly after the girl's body was discov-ered. 
Detective McKibben said Mrs. Griffin related that Mrs. Williams came to her home about four montha ago and told her she was sorry "about the misunderstanding about her going with Kenneth Hubert, my son-in-law." 
Statement in Detail
McKibben further quoted her statement as saying:
"I asked her if she really had been going with him and that if she had she was breaking up my daughter's home.
"She jumped up telling me that it was none of my business if she was

Reds Claim Nazi Attacks Futile
Desperate Rescue Raids Said Repulsed, Another Area Lost by Germans 
MOSCOW, March 19—(AP)—The Nazis are counterattacking on vir-tually every front in desperately fu-tile efforts to rescue trapped troops and stem the Russian advance, the Red Army reported tonight. 
The fiercest fighting of all raged in an unidentified sector of the southen front, the army newspaper Red Star said. 
Trying to relieved several units from a grave predicament, the Germans threw in every weapon of war, but were repulsed and lost another settlement, Red Star related, and added that the Russian advance there was continuing. 
Central Front Story Same
The Story was similar on the central front, where Red Star re-ported the Russians encircled a German garrison in an important town after several days of battle in a blinding blizzard.
A dispatch from that front said that the Germans were trying to furnish the trapped unit with mini-tions and food by plane and that captured orders showed the com=mander of the 101st German rifle regiment had already reduced his men's ration's one-third.
In the Staraya Russa sector of the north central front, the official Russian government paper, Izves-tia, said Hitler's "starved, half-frozen, lice-covered army, 60,-000-strong, is perishing."
Reserves "gathered with difficulty for his so-called spring offen-sive," but sent instead to aid this

One of Four Congressmen Faces Opportunity Of Stepping In as Champion of TVA Cause 
Opportunity knocks at the door of at least four members of Ten-nessee's comparatively young con-gressional delegation.
One of that quartet has the op-portunity to rise as the champion of TVA, the greatest of the gov-ernment's contribution to the state of Tennessee, according to recent survey of public opinion.
Senator K. D. McKellar, who once carried the ball in public at least, ahs become the so-called "arch enemy" of the TVA that has never surrendered politically to the Crump-McKellar oligarchy in Ten-nessee.
 The sceptre is literally on the floor, awaiting the hand of one of the younger generation to carry on.
Senator Tom ("Me Too!")Stew-art has settled into teh shadow of Senator McKellar and obeisance to Boss Crump to the point where the sceptre would prove entirely too heavy to him, even if he could add still another member of his family to a lush public payroll, ac-cording to the latest trend of popular opinion.
Therefore the knock of oppor-tunity comes to one or all of the state's younger congressmen, name-ly:
Estes Kefauver of the Third;
Albert Gore of the Fourth;
Percy Priest of the Fifth;
Wirt Courtney of the Sixth.
And the general opinion is that either of the four has capabilities

Nelson Favors Bonuses, HIgher Piece Pay Rates
Administration Aides Fight Ban on 40-Hour Week and Closed Shop 
By ROGER TATARIAN 
WASHINGTON, March 19— (AP)—War Production Chief Donald M. Nelson today advocated "incen-tive payments" to labor—bonuses and higher piece rates—rather than restrictive legislation, as the best means of speeding up arms out-put. 
he was one of a group of top administration officials who ap-peared before congressional com-mittees to oppose the bill by Rep. Howard Smith (D., Va.), to suspend the 40-hour work week, out-law the closed shop, and limit profits on arms constracts to six per cent. 
Secretary Perkins Heard
Nelson and Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins tesified at a closed session for the senate mili-tary appropriations subcommittee, which is inquiring into production lags and contributory strikes, while Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson appeared before the house naval affairs committee which is studying the Smith bill. 
Smith had testified earlier re-garding his measure, conceding "very frankly" that its purpose is to "uproot the closed shop" and other New Deal legislation which, he said, ahd forced him to the con-clusion "that there is a pretty defi-nite effort to bring this country under the control of organized labor."
Recognizes Gravity of Threat
He said he had heard reports there will be a general labor strike if his measure passes. "And," he added, "I recognize the gravity of that proposition. But I believe the country has come to the conclusion that, if we have an insurrectionist spiriti in Ameircan labor, if we can't trust labor to work in our defense plants without being pam-pered and petted, for God's sake let's know it now. 
"We want to know if Congress is going to operate this war effort or if the labor unions are."
Nelson said he believe incentive payments would do away with the "slowdown"—a labor weapon which Chairman F Land of the military testified is hindering ship on.
Shift From Day Rates
"In my opinion," Nelson said, "there should be incentive pay-ments, an extension of piece rates where there are now day rates, and also the incentive of bonus payments for increased pro-duction." 
Sen. Richard B. Russell (D., Ga.), asked whether steps were being taken to install such a system.
Nelson replied that he would "make it a point to survey the sit-uation right away." he said the plan would not be suitable to all industried "but it would be in certain ones, such as machine parts, forgings, casting and things of that sort—either individual or group incentive plans." 
Sen. C. Wayland Brooks, (R., Ill.) suggested some sort of official recognition be given industrial workers and Nelson replied that he was studying that now. 
Honors for Workers Urged
"Personally," he said, "I feel that if Congress has an award for ex-

Those With 'Private Hatred' Said Playing Into Axis Hands
MacLeish of Facts and Figures Office Says American Will Win 'in Spite of Lies, Treason' 
NEW YORK, March 19— (IP)—Di-rector Archibald MacLeish of the Office of Facts and Figures de-clared tonight that Americans who place their "private hatreds" above their love of country belong to that "malodorous and contemptible com-pany of enemies" attemptnig to destroy America's determination to conquer the Axis. 
But he predicted that America's indignation, "aroused by unbearable outrage to a terrible anger," will upset this Axis strategy to divide and conquer and will win through to victory "in spite of lies, in spite of one man's hates, another's treason." 
Speaking before a dinner gather-ing at Freedom House here, he said the fight to maintain a "fixed and unalterable American resolution" is the principle battleground of the war—far more important than the South Pacific or the Middle East.
Says People Alone Can Win
Declaring that the American People, and not the government alone can win this phase of the war, Mac-Leish said:
"If we Americans can win that battle, no toher loss will matter. If we lose it, no victories—now or in the months to come—will right the balance.
"The victory will be won." 
He said it is not difficult to identify members of the "enemy company" banded together for the nation's destruction by their com-mon hatred of many things—a ha-

U. S. Men 45 to 64 Inclusive Must Register on April 27
None of Oldsters Will Go in Fighting Forces But Will Eventually do Essential War Work
today ordered the o t group of men under the se-lective service law—45 to 64 inclu-sive—to register on April 27, for possible non-combatant service in the future. 
The new registration date pro-claimed by President Roosevelt will leve onyl one group  not yet re-corded, those of 18 and 19 years. Estimates of the total registration for the 45-64 age group range around 15,000,000. 
Hershey Explains Purpose
While none of these comparative oldsters will be taken into the fight-ing forces, there is the possibility that some or many of them will be assigned eventually to essential war work. Brig. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey has said that one purpose of the draft law as an "accurate and systematic appraisal" of the supply of man power. 
Testifying before a house com-mittee last month, Hershey as-serted that "we must have much more control over placements of men than we now  have to meet the war manpower problem." It was noted, however, that there is

Japs Push Near Burma Oil Area
Struggle for Central Area Close as British Plan Prome Defense 
By DANIEL DE LUCE 
WITH TEH BRITISH ARMY IN CENTRAL BURMA, March 10—(AP)—The decisive battle for Central Burma appeared definitely immi-nent today in the Irrawaddy Valley—Burma's spinal column—as Jap-anese troops moved northward by motor transport, boat and mule-train toward the British defenses in the Prome sector sheltering the Yenang-Yaung oil fields.
The field will be for the Prome road, asphalted western branch of the old Burma road running along the broad Irrawaddy to the rich central Burma oil fields, tehnce fto Mandalay. Japanese forces also are moving up the eastern fbranch or Toungoo Road, and there had been preliminary fighting in the Kanyutkwin sector of this eastern road to Mandalay, some 100 miles north of Rangoon.

Capt. Semelser Home From Java
Sinker of 7 Jap Vessels Sees Different Outlook in Australia 
By EDWARD FREEMAN
"The situation will be different in Australia."
So last night said Capt. harold Smelser, 29, whose flying fortress sank at least six Japanese trans-ports and a cruiser while he was piloting American planes in the Java campaign. 
Smelser is home on 14-day leave visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs. L. B. Smelser, 2007 Blakemore Avenue. 
Captain Smelser arrived at Berry Field yesterday afternoon at 3 o'lock in an Army transport plane, flown from California, where he landed two days ago from Australia. 
'And There's MacArthur'
"It'll be different in Australia," Captain Smelser said, "because the islands where the early campaigns took place were wet with mud and were mostly rice fields. Northern Australia is mostly desert—and there's MacArthur!"
He said every fighting man in the Pacific had rather serve under MacArthur than under any other general in the world.
"MacArthur has the confidence of every man in the Pacific," he said. "They'd go through hell for him."
Smelser said the Australians were the "grandest people" he'd ever met. "They get along with us better than anybody," he said. "They think and act like we do. It's just like being at home." 
Lights of Dallas First
The lights of Dallas, where he stopped Wednesday night to call his parents, were the first  he had seen in any city since he flew to Java early in January, he said.

Axis Inspired Utopia After Hitler, Japs Win War Is Prediction of Chattanooga Man
America as We Know It Thing of Past, Engineer Asserts
By JOHN LIPSCOMB
Staff Correspondent 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., March 19—"The German scientific genius will develop instrumentalities of a magnificent civilization; the Orient can show us how to enjoy life and love, and the human monetary system will settle all the accounts in liberty, justice and security under The Brotherhood of Man."
That cure-all is offered by George W. Christians, a Chattanooga engi-neer who told me today that Hitler would win the war and that Ameri-ca as we know it will be a thing of the past—perhaps in 30 days.
Reign of Terror Promised
Crackpot? Certainly—but Chris-tians also is the crackpot who on January 12 of this year, 36 days after Pearl Harbor, wrote a red letter to the Chattanooga police department in which he asserted that his "organization" was about ready for a "reign of terror" in Chattanooga. He also indicated in 
George W. Christians
the letter that "red crusader flags" would fly over the city hall and courthouse.
WHy hasn't he been arrested? Because the federal agents who 
Orient Can Show Us How To Live, Love, Christians Declares
have him under surveillance know that his "thousands of followers" actually do not number more than a few hundred. They also know that Christians—who has gained national norotiety for his vicious attacks on the President and for his threats that a new order is about to be installed—is not as powerful as William Dudley Pelley of Asheville, N. C., (already under arrest and out on bond), and sev-eral others. 
When Proper Time Arrives
Christians, like Pelley, will be ar-rested when the proper time ar-rives, Chattanooga officers believe. But they also pointed out today that Christinas thrives on any pub-licity that sets him up as a martyr before the few "faithful" who don't toss his letters into the wastebasket. 
Chattanoogans long since have become convinced that Christians must be allowed to hang himself, so to speak, and to go so far with

Furious Battle Raging in Air Over Islands
By EDWIN C. STEIN
International News Service Staff Writer
Australia's "zero hour" drew ever closer Thursday night as Japanese troops hacked their way through the jungles of New Guinea toward strategic Port Moresby, and re-ports from the Lyons and Vichy (French) radios told of two huge Niponese invasion fleets moving toward the continent "down under" from the west and the northeast. 
But hard-bitten American and Australian fighting men, elated be-yond measure to be working under Gen. Douglas MacArthur, were ready and anxious to come to grips with the enemy. 
28 Ships Blasted in 10 Days 
Navy bombers emblazoned with the insignia of the United Nations sank or damaged another five enemy ships in a savage raid off New Britain Island. This brought the 10-day total of enemy shipping sunk or damaged to 28. 
Still other United Nations heavy bombers, for the second time in 24 hours, blasted the Japanese-held airdrome at Koepang, Dutch Timor, shattering runaways and starting fires visible for 50 miles. 
In the attack off Rabaul, New Britain, a Japanese heavy cruiser sustained a direct hit in the stern and was left listing and smoking, it was stated. Two other ships were hit with heavy bombs, while two more were lashed by near misses.
No Details on Fleets
No details of the two Japanese invasion fleets were forthcoming, but the Lyons radio said they were composed of "hundreds" of troop-laden transports, accompanied by aircraft carriers and heavy cruisers. 
One of these fleets was said to have come from Java by way of the Timor Sea, while the other allegedly was appraoching Aus-tralia through the Coral Sea. 
The Japanese land attack through New Guinea, heading thorugh the Markan Valley toward Port Mores-by, still was more than 200 miles west of its goal. It was indicated that a well-equipped Australian force in the vicinity soon is expected to contract the enemy. 
Jap Strategy Said Obvious 
The Japanese strategy in this drive was obvious. For weeks Port Moresby, on the southeastern New Guinea coast, has been bom-ed from the air. Now the Japs seem to be trying to move in the "back door." Port Moresby, just across the narrow waters of the Torres Strait from the Australian mainland, is the logical springboard from which the enemy hopes to launch an assault on Australia. 
General MacArthur, still traveling through Australia en route to his headquarters, would not make a statement, but he did talk with Brig. Gen. Patrick J. Hurley, former U. S. secretary of war and now minister to New Zealand.
Plans to Return to Philippines 
Hurley said that MacArthur plans to build an offensive force as rapidly as possible for the ex-press purpose of smashing Japan. The glamorous general told Hurley that he is still in command of the Philippine theater and confidently expects to return there when the Nipponese are crushed. 
Hurley said that MacArthur's break through the Japanese block-ade around the the Philippines was one of the most spectacular adventures in military history. He declined to give details.
German Missionaries Said Guiding Japs Toward Moresby
MELBOURNE, March 19—(AP)—Guided by a Nazi German mission-aries, a strong Japanese force was reported tonight to be advancing overland in New Guinea toward Port Moresby, enemy-coveted springboard for invasion of teh Australian mainland, while over the continent's whole defense periphery the combined U.S.-Australian air (Continued on Page 10, Column 4)
