[*Recording trip*]

September 28, 1938

To the Postmaster
Ironwood, Mich.

Dear Sir:

On last Saturday, September 24, the Library of Congress
sent from the Music Division a letter for Mr. Alan Lomax, who was
to receive it,  general delivery, at Ironwood, Michigan. This
letter was registered and dispatched via air mail. According to
a wire yesterday from Mr. Lomax, who is a member of our staff,
he changed his plans and proceeded to Calumet, Michigan, where
he is awaiting this particular letter.

Will you please forward it immediately to Calumet,
general delivery, where Mr. Lomax will be expecting it? We are
wiring Mr. Lomax to this effect.

Any service you can render me will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Edward N. Waters
Acting-Chief, Division of Music
