own back.  And they broke his arm, shot him and broke his arm.  I
was there, and since I had been deputized to help to guard the city
I left there.
Why was that?  Why did you leave?  I don't quite understand.
Well, sir, that gave me a scare, and I left there.
You saw the fight with your own eyes.
Oh, yes.
They made a song about that, didn't they?
Yes'm.  I knew the man that designed it, but I don't recollect his
name.  He worked on a livery stable.  It was a dead-end street, up on 
Texas Street.  A dead-end street, and there was a livery stable and this
fellow was the keeper, and there was a patch that lay along side
that road that they had to go out.  He was in that patch, and they
said there was an old burned stump and it burned a hole in that
stump, kind of a knot-hole, which was there he lay with his Winchester
to shoot those fellows off their horses as they come by and they never
could see him.  Yeah, that's what they said up there.
Well, then I left there, and I came back to see my father.  I stayed
there a short while, and then I left again.
How'd you find things at home, though?
Well, everything was prosperous, was getting along pretty well.  Well,
they missed me, they missed my labor you know.  Then, they wanted me
to come back and stay at home.. I couldn't see it that way.  I see that
I could have a better time, I could make more money and have better opportunities,
so I left there and came to Dallas, worked there a while
and went on to Sherman, Texas.  I made that my home since principally; 
however, in 19 and 2 or 3, 19 and 3, I stayed there at
home, I mean at Sherman, I bought me a place there, and times got so
terrible, I went on back to Oklahoma again.
