BJ TAPE 7A, p. 7

      But I had a good time down there, I'm tellin' ya.  I would 
go fishin' by myself, a lot of times.  So one day I was down 
there.  I had a dawg, followed me everywhere.  An' he was a won'erful 
dawg.  An' I went down there one day fishin'.  An' this place 
was high, high.  An' this trestle, ya know, when ya go down, 
people what -- Those boys, ya know, they take off they shoes an' 
go down it , ya know.  An' them railroad people, when they go down 
there to work, they got spikes on they shoes.
      My hook got hung down there an' I wanted to fish anyway. 
I didn' wanna walk back home; I didn't have another hook.  So 
I went down that ladder.  Lawd, you know God ha' really take 
care a me.  I went down that ladder.  An' the tide was comin' 
in, brother!  I'm tellin' ya.  I went on down there an' I got 
my hook unhung.  My dawg was lookin' on me jus' like he wanted 
to jump down there [any] every minute.  An' I went to goin' back up 
that ladder.  Somethin' tried to make me look back when I got 
near 'bout to the top, but I wouldn't look back.  I began to 
feel funny and curious, but I wouldn't look back; I helt on. 
Oh, look like I got -- I's jus' funny, all over. But I went 
on up, ya know.  It was a tall -- a long kinda thing. 
  An' I got on up to the top an' [the] that dog was standin' there.  He 
jus' smelt me; he jus' whined; he jus' licked -- ha, ha, you know.  An' 
then that time I looked down the track an' I see the man come 
rummin'.  Mr. Dickson, a man that worked there.  He [say] said he seed me 
sittin' on the track, you know, when he went to git some fiddlers. 
Fiddlers all down on the side of the track; they put out 
fiddles to fish with. An' he said, while he [picin] pickin' up 
the fiddlers, an' he looked up again, he didn' see nothin' but 
Jig. you know, this dawg, [was] his name was Jig, lookin' down there.
