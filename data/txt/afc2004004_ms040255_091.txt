Alkin Drum 21.5

Akin drum, Akin drum
Ken ye how a Whig can fight,
Akin Drum
He can fight the hero bright
with his heel + amour light
[*W*] And his wind of heavn'ly might
Akin drum, akin drum
[*And his wind of heavenly might*]
Is not Jamie in the night ?
Akin Drum

Donald's running round + round - Ad [2]
But the chief cannot be found
And the Dutchmen a hae drowned
And King Jamie he is crowned
But the dogs will get us stoned

And the bonnie laird o Grant [2]
Aye the godly Laird o Grant
That Cameronian Saint
For his all his hieland cant
To his right he has a want

We had heard  o Whigs galore [2]
But we've soght the country o'er
W. cannon + claymore
And still they are before [ [2] ]
We may seek forever more.
