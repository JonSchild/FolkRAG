     But that's what the doctor told me befo' he even was, was,
was ah, well, he wa'n' [more than] hardly 3 hours old.  Because
they had done brought him in there to me an' everything.  An'
he talked with me an' everything.  Yeah, that's [by] why I heard. . .
     An' the people was 'round there -- I seed the people befo',
that they, ah, doctors, doctor taken the baby. . .He wa' ah, he
wa' walkin' the kitchen talkin' to Mama an' the other peoples
an' my husband.  So, diffrunt ones would come back, cryin'.
Miss, Miss, Miss Clara is the only one that didn't. Miss Clara
come in.  'Z (there was) Leddy -- yeah, Leddy there; Leddy's
livin' -- wa' Leddy, Miss Clara an' ah, Miss Rosie, Miss Bee,
they all was cryin'.  An' little chilren, the big-sized, this
same girl what I come to take her bein' the baby that was born
in the [vell] veil?  She was a little girl then.  She was cryin'.
She is on Long Island now.  An' I knew there sumpin' sad goin'
on.  Then I heard the doctor ask George which one he wanted
to save.  Asked George and Mama together.  So George said, "Well,"
said, "Save my wife."  Yessuh.  And he come to git the baby.
     So both saved, ya see?  The Lawd was in the plan, was both
saved.  And that's where the instruments slipped on 'im, see.
That what made that, that mark, see?  He, he was born with that
mark on him.  See where that thing slipped?  It didn't mark this
side but on this side.  I guess that's the right hand, too?
Yeah.  It slipped there.  Clear on up, come on up that way.  An'
it had a little knot right there.  I guess that where the instruments
met together.  An' so, it, it went down over, before [the] that
day was out good, you know, ['cause] but this mark here.  It's near
there.  It look, it look jus' like oh, he mighta been shavin'
or somethin' mighta been. . .an' sliced hisself a lil' bit.
