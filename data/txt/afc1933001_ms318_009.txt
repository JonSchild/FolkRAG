FLYIN' U TWISTER

VERSE 3
So while they're a puttin' that bull in the chutes,
I'm a strappin' my spurs, to the heels of my boots,
I looks that bull over, and to my surprise,
It's a foot and a half, in between his two eyes.
Right on top of his shoulders, he's got a big hump,
And I cinches my riggin', just back of that lump,
I lights in his middle, and I lets out a scream,
He comes out with a beller, and the rest is a dream.

Chorus 3
Well he jumps to the left, but he lands tow'rd the right,
But I ain't no greenhorn, I'm still sittin' tight,
The dust starts to foggin' right out of his skin,
And he's a wavin' his horns, right under my chin.

Verse 4
At a sunnin' his belly, he couldn't be beat,
He's a showin' the buzzard, the sole of his feet,
He's a dippin' so low, that my boots fill with dirt,
And he's makin' a whip, of the tail of my shirt,
He's a snappin' the buttons, right off of my clothes,
Just a buckin' and bawlin', and a blowin' his nose,
The crowd was a cheerin', both me and that bull,
But he needed no help, while I had my hands full.

Chorus 4
Then he goes to fence-rowin', and weavin' behind,
My head starts to snappin', and I sorta went blind,
When he starts in high divin', I lets out a groan,
Next we went up together, but he comes back alone.

Verse 5
Up high I turns over, and below I kin see,
He's a pawin' up dirt, just a waitin' for me,
I kin picture a grave, and a big slab of wood,
Readin' here lays the twister, that thought he was good,
Then I notices somethin', don't seem kin to be true,
But the brand on his hip, was a big Flyin' U.
When I landed he charged, but I got enough sense,
To outrun that bull, to a hole in the fence.

Chorus 5
I dives through that hole, and I want you to know,
That I ain't goin' back, to no wild west show,
At a straddlin' them brahm'ers you kin bet I'm all through
And I'm a sore-footin' back, to the old Flyin' U.
