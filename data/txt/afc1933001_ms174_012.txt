Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
Salem, Virginia

Dear Alan:

     Thank you for your letter of September 4 and your telegram
of September 6. The telegram arrived so late that its contents
could not even receive serious consideration.

     Your remarks about Mrs. Schwartz's activities were surprising
to say the least for we had decided on them in conference before
you left. If you will consult my letter of September 4, you will 
notice that there is no mention whatsoever of cataloging. She
is making an inventory of the records on the shelf. This will 
not only allow her to familiarize herself with the records but
eventually perhaps locate some of the missing records. Filing will
have to away your return when we can devise a suitable basis for 
it.

     Many of the projects (including Father's) which you propose 
will also have to away your return because I must furnish Dr.
Evans with more information than I have, before he will consider
them for approval.

     I am glad that you find your present project so stimulating
intellectually.

     Regards!

                                                                           Sincerely, 
                                                                                  {{signed}}
                                                                                       Harold Spivacke
                                                                                       Chief, Division of Music
