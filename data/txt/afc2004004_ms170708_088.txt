Lomax: The Barley Straw?
Cox: Yes.
I've seen that. I won't stop indoors. I went across to another house,
there. Any thing bar that. I didn't want that.
Lomax: Is In Newlyn Town an interesting song, Peter?
Kennedy: What?
Lomax: In Newlyng Town - is it an interesting song?
Kennedy: Yes.
Lomax: You said you had that one, I think.
Cox: Oh yes. I got in on a record - at home. (pause)
Lomx: Does the B.B.C. have that, Peter? (cut)
Cox: Little bits an' that sort o' thing. But I dunno half what I do
know.
Lomax: You might turn up something absolutely new that way, you
know.
Cox: Oh, yeah.
Lomax: Let's try Newlyn Town and then sing a few of those little
bits. (pause) You going, Peter?
Kennedy: Okay.
Cox:
In Newlyn town I was bred an' born,
At Stephen's Green where I died of scorn;
I served my time at the saddler trade
And I always was a roving blade.
