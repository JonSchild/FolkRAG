Rumor's

Rumor's are very dangerous
in war time.  I heard a
rumor that Hilter has his
best agent in Chicago, who
will come in contact with
every war plant here, and explode
it in some way.  It is
very dangerous to spread rumors 
like that because the employee's
of the war plant might believe it
and quit their job.
