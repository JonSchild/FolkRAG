BJ: Well, I don't know.  I think it's about the same with me
'cause I love chilren so well.  An' I just put 'em all in one.

to have gran' chilren [because] you know.  You know that you're still
'cumulatin' for the Lord, ya know?  Ya
ya see?  Yeah, I say that ya seed is spreadin' more an' more.
That's what I feel about it.  An' then great-gran's come in; that's
your seed spreadin' more an' more.  They say [mother flower can] multiply an'
'cumulate, ya know?  Chilrun upon the earth.  An' so I think that's
jus' a m-my seed is spreadin'.  Jus' like a tree, ya know?  Like bearin'
fruit.  You know, I think that, you know; that's the way I feel
about it.  An' so, an'...Ya shed off one fruit an' hit grow
down, fall down.  An' hit comes up, beside that tree, an' bring
on' mo' fruit.  That's jus' [â€¦] You know that mean that tree is worthwhile,
ya know?  It's a...It did sumpthin' great.  See, that's what I'm
talkin' about.  One right after the other (NO MORE SOUND ON TAPE
FROM HERE ON.)
