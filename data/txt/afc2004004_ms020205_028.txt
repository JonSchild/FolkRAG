Reverend Roe Reel 1 p. 1
I was born in Ramsen County, Webster Parish, Louisiana.
How long ago was that?
It was in 1971.
Who were your parents?
Anthony Blue and Eliza -- she was a Bates before she married.

Pretty hard times paid for that farm, working, you know. I began working in the field as a full-hand in the fields when I was nine years old.. I began plowing at nine.
It must have been mighty hard on a little boy.
Yes, (laughter) I remember some time that some time it would throw you down, well, I'd get up and try it again, you know. We had a hard time -- And mr. Hasting claimed the hogs -- you
