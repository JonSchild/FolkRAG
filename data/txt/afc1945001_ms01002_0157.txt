Director for an advertising agency; director of several
successful political campaigns; and now sales promotion
man for the Gibson Electric Refrigerator Corporation, 
Greenville, Michigan.
   I would appreciate your consideration for a place in 
the work you are doing - and because I would hardly 
expect you to consider me on the basis of this letter 
alone, I refer you to one or all of the following:
         Frank Murphy, Justice of the Supreme Court
         Harold Smith, Director of the Budget
          Blair Moody, Washington correspondent

You can toss this letter aside - naturally I  hope you 
won't.  And if you don't, you will  not be sorry because 
I know I can do a job for you - and I'd like to talk with 
you so that you may make a judgment on that score for
yourself.  My address is - 313 S. Irving, Greenville, 
Michigan and I'd be glad to see you at your convenience, 
or to write you further as to how I believe I might 
contribute to  your effort.

                                            Naively yours,
                                            Gregory V. Drumm
                                            Gregory V. Drumm
