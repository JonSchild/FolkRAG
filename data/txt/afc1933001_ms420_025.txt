Despression Blues, (Whittaker)
Tampa Red (The Guitar Wizard), Vocalion 1656.

If I could tell my troubles, it may would give po' heart ease,
But depressions has got me, somebody help me please.

If I don't feel no better, than I feel today,
I'm gonna back my few clothes and make my getaway.

I've begged and borrowed till my friends don' want me round,
I'll take old man Depression and leave this no-good town.

Depression's here, they tell me it's everywhere,
So I'm goin' back to Florida and see if Depression's there

Oh, how it would help if I could just explain,
But depression has me, it's 'bout to drive me insane.
