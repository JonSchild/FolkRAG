Lomax: Do you believe in God ?

Barry: Well, I do.

Lomax: Do you think you're mother's in heaven now ?

Barry: Well, I hope shemight be. But some way and another, I
don't look into that affair. I'm a very bad religious person.
I don't attend my duties at all. When you're brought up as a
Roman Catholic, you have to attend chapel or church, and how
does it come that I actually forget all this ? Why, I wonder ?
I know I believe in God in a certain way. I know he's there and
helps out everybody.

Lomax: Do you believe in ghosts ?
BarryNo. Never believed in any spirits, listened to yarns about
banshees. When you listen to a banshee, your first cousin or
someone belonging to you is going to die.

Lomax: How did you feel when you found out you were pregnant
with your first child ? Were you happy ?

Barry: I wasn't indeed, no. Because I hadn't very much under-
standing.

Lomax: Did it hurt ? Were you ill?

Barry: I wasn't. No.

Lomax: Were you ill when you had your child ?

Barry: I wasn't indeed. I was a very healthy person.

Lomax: Did you enjoy your baby or not ?

Barry: She was alright. Just at the present time she's alright.
Someway and another....

Lomax: Do you enjoy looking after her, feeding her ?

Barry:  Yes, in a sort of way. I didn't neglect her, kept her
clean. But still, these people now at present time. I'm
not so wild about th m. Why ?  Once I get into some place where
there's music, I seem to forget about everybody else. I think
that's a bad quality.
