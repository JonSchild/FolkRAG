Report made -- August 8, 1942 

REPORT ON RUMORS 
In this state, at this time, there is very little talk about 
the war and very little consciousness of just how serious the situation 
is.  This is due, no doubt, to the fact that right at present we are in 
the midst of harvest and have one of the greatest crops in the history 
of the state.  Another factor entering into this lack of war consciousness 
is that this in the one state in the Union which has not war industries.  
The only thing that has disturbed the serenity of the people in this area 
is the saboteur's trial and Mr. Cummins sent you a special report on 
that yesterday.
