OPERATING DIRECTIVE NO. 4
TO:              Branch Directors, Bureau Chiefs and Deputies
FROM:        M. S. Eisenhower, Associate Director
SUBJECT:    Keeping Offices Open on Saturday Afternoons

            Operations of the Office of War Information require the presence of a
working staff in all bureaus throughout Saturday afternoon.
            It is hoped that general curtailment of the Saturday half-holiday can
be avoided by arrangements within each bureau for the retention of sufficient
personnel each Saturday to keep operations underway.
            This directive is not intended to alter the basic forty-four hour
week for employees of the OWI. (i.e. 8 hours a day Monday through Friday,
and 4 hours on Saturday morning). Where this basic schedule is in effect in
Washington and in the field any employee who works on Saturday afternoon is
entitled to compensatory leave. This leave should not exceed four hours
in any case and should not exceed the time put in on Saturday over and above
the usual four hours. Compensatory leave shall be taken on day other then
Saturday in the week immediately following the Saturday when the afternoon
work is performed.
            Bureau Chiefs are requested to put such arrangements into effect
immediately in all units under their supervision. It is assumed that an
equitable system of staggering the release of personnel from week to week will
be employed.

                                                                            [*M.S. Eisenhower*]
