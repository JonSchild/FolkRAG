Enoch, Livingston, Alabama 1940
Richard Amerson, explaining the silence of his friend, Enoch, told me:
"No, sir, he don't talk much; he jus' formally transfers his judgements by signs."
On our two first [visit to] meetings at Livingston Enoch had spoken no word at all. [When I spoke to him] He replied to questions with loud explosions of laughter and he "hollered." His nervous laughter was not unusual but his hollering was unique in effectiveness. His powerful voice would carry for miles and miles. Alan and I from the beginning of our travels through the south sought for "hollerers" but we [had] never found one who equalled Enoch.
