Edward P. Jennings
Pawlet, Vermont

Dear Jennings:

     Your letter comes most opportunely in one way
and in another not. I have just returned from a two
week recording trip in Vermont and the letter which
was to bring your address to me reached me after I 
returned. I made one attempt to find you in Bennington
but failed so gave up hope. I still remember after two 
years your remarkable records of spirituals and I welcome
your generous offer to the archive from the bottom of
my heart. We now have facilities for duplicating records
so can bring your spirituals into the archive at no cost
to yourself with the benefit of the best possible acetate
recording. Please let me know when you can come. My
days here at the library are from Wednesday through Saturday
of each week.

     Another matter which I am anxious to discuss
with you is the possibility of your cooperating with
Professor Harold Thompson of the New York State Teachers
College, Helen Harkness Flanders of the Vermont Archive
of Folk Song, and the Library of Congress in extending
the collecting of "ew England folk songs on records.
The library will be able to furnish discs and needles,
Miss Flanders mileage for the car, and I think we can get
a machine from someplace. We all thought of you as the best
worker in that region and when you come down I hope I can
play you enough material to interest you, if you are not 
already interested, in this significant and important 
undertaking.

Cordially yours,

Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
