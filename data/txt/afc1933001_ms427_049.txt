DOGIE SONG

1. As I was a walking one morning for pleasure
I spied a cow puncher all riding alone
His hat was throwed back and his spurs was a jingling
And as he approached he was singing this song.

CHORUS - Whoopee ti yi yo, git along, little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own;
Whoopee ti yi yo, git along, little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

2. It's early in Spring that we round up the dogies,
We mark them and brank them and bob off their tails;
We round up our horses, load up the chuck-wagon,
And then throw the dogies out onto the trail.

CHORUS-

3. It's whooping and yelling and driving the dogies,
And oh, how I wish you would only go on;
It's whooping and punching, go on little dogies,
You know that Wyoming will be your new home.

CHORUS-

4. Some boys they go up on the trail just for pleasure,
But that's where they get it most awfully wrong;
You haven't an idea the trouble they give us, --
While we go driving them all the way long.

CHORUS-

----------

ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT

Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee, All through the
night;
Guardian angels God will send thee, All through the night,
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping, Hill and vale in 
slumber steeping,
I my loving vigil keepin, All through the night.

While the moon her watch is keeping, All through the 
night;
While the weary world is sleeping, All through the night.
O'er thy spirit gently stealing, Visions of delight
revealing,
Breathes a pure and holy feeling, All through the night.
