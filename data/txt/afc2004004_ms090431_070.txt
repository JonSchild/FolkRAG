A: What happened to these people, did they land in the insane asylum
or did so e of them die or what?
S: Some of them wetn crazy, went to Jackson to the crazy-house, insane
asylum. Some of then got killed., and some of them just died. And
some of them walked along the street and fell out; they'd eat the
brains up, or something.

S: Yessir, but out in the lumber camp they can take it any way they
wanted. Yo know, this used to be a kind of outlaw country. When they
had saloons in Lambeth and all around [this p?] these different country
places, that sold anything they wanted, and they could buy.
They people first learned to use it from the jockeys. Theyu sed to use
it for horses, and the jockeys would use it for their horses, you know,
and they got so they tried it themselves and they liked it and they
give it to the women, and the women st arted and used it and then amongst 
the men, some of the men started to use it.
A: When did the cocaine break up in th[is]e country?
S: I don't know exactly, I can't remember exactly. It went out when
the saloons went out, that is, went out publicly but they could get
it from drugstores and places.
It's played out in this part of the country, don't nobody use it now 
that I know of.
A: Did these people that used cocaine sing the song?
S: Yessir.
A: Would you sing for me now, Will -- what you remember?
