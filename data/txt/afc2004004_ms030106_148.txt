1668 A

Bitch, you got the best cunt I ever had (3)
Maybe it was that what I got was bad.

I put that bitch right on the stump (3)
I screwed her till her pussy stunk.

[*Variations in 12 lines of each stanza not noted*]

If your man knew I had that prick in you, (3)
What do you think that dirty no good son-of-a-bitch
would do?

I would tell him to kiss my fuckin' ass (3)
Just as long as your kissing ass will last.

Do you love me, baby, that way I grind you so (3)
Tell me, baby, that your man will never know.

Always make it, babe, a pallet on your flo' -
So that dirty no-good-son-of-a-bitch will never know.

[*1668 B*]
Anytime I fucks a bitch, I know she's my bitch

But all I ask you to do - don't tell your dirty
no-good-son-of-a bitch.

Tell me, baby, don't you like the way I grind?
If you do, baby, let me get a little behind.
