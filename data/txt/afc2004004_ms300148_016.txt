Mr. Spence Moore
Chilhowie, Va.
Dear Spence:
I am sorry that you have grown anxious about your
songs. You don't realize the difficulty of marketing
this material. So far I have been able to include
"Jimmy Sutton" in an album and I think it is the kind
of album from which it will be picked up and perhaps
made into a single by somebody else, thus bringing us,
I hope, some real money. It will not, however, be a 
single to begin with for it is not performed in any of the
ways that are commercial these days.
I am going to try this month to find a market for the
remainder of the tapes I made during the trip on which
I met you. About four or five other albums altogether.
In these albums I hope to include tow or three more of
your songs. Please let me know whether you wish me to
do this or whether you wish to withdraw this material
and work with someone else who can deliver for you more
quickly. Meantime, if you and your brother want to make
a tape of the original songs and send it to me I will be
seeing the four [b??thers] in the next couple of weeks and
will be able to show them what you have. That is by far
the quickest way that I know personally about for you to
realize something for yourself and your brother.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
