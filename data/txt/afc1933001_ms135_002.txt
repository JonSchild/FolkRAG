July 1, 1938.

Mr. Samuel Clay Dixon,
Mt. Vernon, Indiana.

Dear Mr. Dixon:

You must believe by this time that I have forgotten my promise to return the song sheets you lent me in April. As a matter of fact, I have returned to the Indiana material for the first time last week; and in going over it, decided to ask the WPA for copies of the sheets that you lent me.

If, however, the WPA cannot furnish me with theses songs, would it be possible for you to present the Library with your copies; or if not, to allow them to remain in our hands until we can have them copied.? That, I suppose, will be sometime next Fall.

I want to take this occasion to thank you for the friendly help you gave me in Indiana. With very best regard, I am

Sincerely yours,
