and will, for your own peace
of mind, spare you as much as
possible.

I know I've written to[o]
you too often. Hereafter, I repeat, I'll
spare you as much as
possible. I'd like to hear
about your courses and teachers
and how it feels to be again
where you can't talk back every
instant. By the way, I saw your
claims in the Washington Star asking
close kin to Jeb Stuarts successor.
Not very close, I fear. Your greatest
war honor is due your grandfather
who left Washington & Lee University
when a freshman and fought
throughout the war as a private
in the famous Rockbridge Battery,
first organized by Stonewall Jackson.
So long.

Lovingly, Father -
