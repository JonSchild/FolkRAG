Mr. R., with Congregation: "A, second space, B, third line,
C, third space, D, fourth line, E fourth space and first
line, F, fifth line and first space, G sets above, and
second line.

Mr. R.: OK. What's this one?
(He quizzes the congregation a few times)
Every Good Boy Does Fine, say that (They say it).
E. G, B, D, F. For your spaces: F, A, C, E. 
Now that is your G clef. The tenor, treble, and alto
always sing on the G clef. Occasionally, the alto 
will sing on the F clef. We got two or three songs where the 
alto sings on the F clef. We use to have a C clef, but
we didn't have very many altos written on it, so we just
eliminated it, and only have an F and a G. Now let's go
over the F clef. It's a step and a half lower, uh, on
lines and spaces, where the letter is, ... because middle
C was an added line below. If you add middle C, the way
it works out, F would be on the line...If we had another
clef right here, we'd have to go down to C, B, A, G, F.
The way it works out, it would be on a line. It would
be on the fourth line, whereas, by working up, it would
be on a space, the first space here (but it would start
with middle C). OK, we start on A, first space; but 
when we get to this finger, we gotta...(?)...

Everyone together: A, first space, B, second line, C, second
space, D, third line, E, third space, fourth line and
space below, G, fourth space and first line, and A, fifth 
line and first space. 

Mr. R.: If you drop down and start on A, B, A, on the first space,
where you started on A, second space, on the G.
