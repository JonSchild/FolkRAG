LOMAX: folklore are almost impossible to determine anyhow. So I've arranged these three recitals of American folk songs in terms of subject matter, Love, Violence and Work, with the hope that so ordered the songs may shed some light on the special and curious nature of the Americans who sing them.
Love, Love in America --- well, if we really knew a good deal about the subject we'd be close to the motivations that now thrust us Americans round the world... There's an old couplet out of the Southern frontier somewhere-----

Love it is a funny thing shaped just like a lizard
Runs right up your backbone and nibbles at your gizzard.

You might sum the main pattern of the songs up this way...love was a subject for comedy or else you died of it. Mainly you died of it.

SINGS: 
Sweet Williams died like a Saturday night
And Barbry died of Sunday, 
Her mother died for the love of both
And was buried on Easter Monday.....

Barbara Allen ----known in the states as were all the ballads that came from England and Scotland, as "Oldtime love songs" ---- songs to sing at courting parties ---- romantic songs of dying for love.... Next to Barbara Allen the most widely sung of them all was the British Lord Thomas and Fair Annet,  known in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ELLENDER... Robin Roberts sings a faithful copy of a blind Virginia ballad singer's version-

DISK:     SINGS:  LORD THOMAS AND FAIR ELLENDER
ROBIN:
LOMAX: How many sweet faced old ladies I've recorded up and down America, rocking their grandchildren, singing the "kicked it against the wall" line and saying "Yes, that was one of the favourite love songs when I was a girl"...

[Note: Bottom Margin] There can hardly be any question that this rather dolorous and bloodstained
