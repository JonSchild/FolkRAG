Mr. Charles Anthony
Southern Methodist University
Dallas, Texas

Dear Mr. Anthony:
    I am sorry to say that you have been misinformed
about the prospect of a governmental appropriation for
duplicating the records of the Folk-Song Archive in the
Library of Congress. No such appropriation has been
made and, as I understand it, there will be no further
appropriations made by Congress for a year. We have
not yet a machine suitable for making duplicate records.
    I feel sure that whenever arrangements are made
for having the Folk-Song records duplicated, the wishes
of Southern Methodist University will be given due consideration.
    Sincerely yours,
    Honorary Consultant and Curator
    Archive of American Folk-Song
