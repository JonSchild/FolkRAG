I Never Knew What Blues Were 
Until You Went Away

By CLARENCE WILLIAMS

Tempo de Blues


I met a lit-tle girl she was the
best in the world  She al-ways wore a smile she'd make your
life worth while_ She came to me one lone-some day_

I have been wor-ried bro-ken heart-ed
since she's been gone_ Ev-er since my lov-ing ba-by
did me wrong_ She's gone and left me now you see_
