I was once a merry ploughboy
And plo the fields all day
head comes sd I must run
away
I threw on I the old guard
frock

And if ever I [ever] return again
A [?roys??] I will be
With burnishes on my sholders
And kisses on my brow or my knees

Goin back to the press

He is an actor with all
the recitations - speeches from
plays - a gt natural actor
with a beautiful deep voice

Two halves a travel + a mover
the budgey the old Wiltshire
regiment - -
