Among the Suggestions
Outstanding among the suggestions
made by the board were the
following three points: 1. The establishment 
of a series of half hour
evening programs dramatizing the
processes of learning.  2.  The estal

continuous use of evening periods
withdrawn from the commercial
schedule, and definitely reserved for
experimental broadcasts in the educational
field.

"I never went to school but three
months in my life," says Uncle
Alec, but what doesn't mean Uncle
Alec doesn't keep up with what's
going on and isn't well read.  Last
year he received as a gift a copy

presentation of "The American School of the Air." originating in the
studios or WDBJ at Roanoke Tuesday, is the son of John A. Lomax,
curator of folk music at the Library of Congress.  Alan sings American
folk songs to his own accompaniment on the School of the Air every
Tuesday.  But, curiously enough, Alan never wanted to collect folk
songs.  He wanted to be a philospher.
Deciding Factor
In the summer of 1932, he made
a trip with his father into the field,
in an old jalopy with modern
record-making equipment which
is the sine qua non of the folk
music expert.  Alan was just along
for the ride, but while in the
little town of Taylor, Texas, the
father and son heard a Negro
woman singing a strangely beautiful
song, entitled "Thank God Almighty,
I'm Free at Last."  The 
young man was so moved by it
that he decided to devote his life
to finding other music like it.  Now
he's assistant to his father at the
Library, and has personal charge
of a collection of 3,500 recordings.
Lomax has had some remarkable
experiences in his search for
folk singing.  Somebody told him
about a Negro piano player who
could sing a score of verses to the
song about the man who killed
Billy Lyons for a milk-white
Stetson hat.  Lomax hunted him
up, and found him in a night
club.  They got acquainted, and
one night Lomax showed up with a
typewriter and a sheaf of paper.

huddled around the piano.  Finally,
the proprietor of the bistro decided
that Lomax was bad for
business.  With an interesting lack
of subtlety he walked to the piano,
took the only lamp in the place,
and walked out, leaving darkness.
The singer was furious.
"Excuse me a moment, Mr.
Lomax," he apologized. Then he
too disappeared.  He came back
with a bruise on his knuckles- and
the lamp.
"I don't let people treat my
friends thataway," he explained
to Lomax, sat down at the piano,
and continued playing.
Although he's been threatened by
an irate mountaineer with a knife,
and has had a dozen amusing incidents,
Lomax isn't interested in
folk songs simply for the thrills
and laughter that comes with
them.  "A great deal of the best
popular art is derived from American
folk sources," Lomax maintains.
"By brining American
folk music to the people, radio
can awaken them to the basically
democratic character of American
art and the possibilities of the
growth of American art from native 
sources."
