Anecdotes
Arms and the Woman

In battle-ready Hawaii, where
the ratio between is sexes is 260
men to 1 woman, the Boy Meets Girl
problem is something that even
the Island's excellent U.S> O.
cannot keep pace with.

At police headquarters in Honolulu
I was told of an able-bodied
seaman, on shore leave from the
SOuth Pacific, who broke into a
department store window and
walked off with a lovely form
draped in evening dress. When the
police caught up with him, he
was repentant.

"I didn't mean anything wrong,"
he said. "I just wanted to get
my arms around something
feminine".
