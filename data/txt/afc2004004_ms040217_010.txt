(Spool CXII is not altogether satisfactory.  As the batteries
were beginning to get low by this time, it is made at slightly
less than the correct speed.  Also Nos. 516-518 are blemished
by the same defect that spoiled Not. 470, 505, and 507.
Mrs Nicolson and Miss MacPhee, who is related to
Mrs Angus John MacLellan recorded in Benbecula, are remarkably
fine folksingers, and some of these recordings such as Nos. 496
498, 508, 511 and 512 are of outstanding interest and quality.
Spool CXIII
Lochboisdale 3/11/50
Peter MacLellan, Altachadh Leapa (traditional bedside prayer)
This is a good recording also.
