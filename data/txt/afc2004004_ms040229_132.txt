Hospitality
I saw a stranger yestreen
I put food in the eating place
Drinks in the drinking place
Music in the listening place
[?Said] the sacred name of the [?Triune]
He blessed myself + my house
my cattle + my dear ones
And the lark said in her song
   often, often, often
Goes Christ in the stranger's guise
   Often, often, often
[Goes Christ in the stranger's guise]
