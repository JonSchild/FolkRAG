information campaign on Lend-Lease--lectures, feature stories, editorials, discussion groups, Sunday articles, etc. 

Sometimes an information gap cannot be filled temporarily, because of military security. When a warship is in an American harbor, 
for example, that fact cannot be published without aiding the enemy, even though the warship and its sailors are visible to many people 
in the port area. Extravagant rumors about the ship, or the crew, or 
the cargo may arise from such a situation. But these rumors would not 
spread unless people repeated what they saw or what they heard. The 
Office of War Information is in possession of ample evidence that the 
enemy, or his agents, often does not know what hundreds of Americans 
do know about a given war port or war plant; the repetition of facts 
or rumors, in such circumstances, often makes it easier for the enemy 
to find out what he did not know, or simply suspected.

Types of Rumors

The 4,500 rumors analyzed by the Office of War Information fall into five general classes:
a. By far the greatest number may be called "hate rumors"; they express prejudice, animosity, or hostility for
groups other than the enemy.
b. The second group may be classified as "anxiety rumors"; They reflect uneasiness or fear and commonly take the 
form of unfounded reports of [Allied] U.N. disaster or weakness,
or of overwhelming enemy strength.
c. A third group, classifiable as "escape rumors", reflect,
in the main, wishful thinking about the progress and duration of the war.
