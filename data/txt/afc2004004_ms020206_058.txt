Reverend Roe.  Reel 5.  P.3
give me an education; [they] and really didn't think I needed it. My father
was a very peculiar man anyway. He was a natural-born mathematician.
[*Father -- mathematician*]
He could work any example you give him and he didn't know the multiplication
table. I don't know how, and no one else, but even the
clerk of the court there at Minda, Louisiana, if my father had to work
an example, and he had to work that example he'd stop and wait for the
answer, and when he give the answer, he would bet anybody it was correct.
I seen him one day sit down and tell how many cross ties it would take [ties were needed]
to build a railroad from Memphis to New Orleans, and I think it, oh, I don't [just] disremember,
[*How many cross ties to N.O.?*]
but I think it was someting like eight or nine hundred miles
, and he told it in fifteen minutes just exactly how many cross ties
it would take. And that would be mighty good for one of your best
mathematicians. Yessuh, [sir].
But he didn't think the children needed it because he was able to do
that, and it would have been fine, they'd a let them kept me and give 
me an education.
A: What did your grandfather look like, your white grandfather?
[*White grandfather -- part Irish.*]
R: He was part Irish, and he had the Irish brogue.
A: Do you remember anything he ever said to you?
R: No. I remember he could make coffins, and I remember he madeone
for himself, and got in it and couldn't get out, and they had to go
and take him out (laughter). Yes, they had to go and take him out.
A: Of course, in those days and times, almost every white man had a 
white mistress, I mean had a colored mistress, as well as a white
wife down there in Louisiana.
[*Whites have Negro mistresses!*]
R: Yeah, [yeah,] right, they all had a colored sweetheart, [someone] and they would to go and
see [them] hers, and sometimes they treated them mighty nice, and sometimes
they didn't.
A: Would you see there was any love there?
