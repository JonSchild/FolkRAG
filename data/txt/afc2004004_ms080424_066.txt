Roll 53 Stan Hicks' house 6

(Stan) so, the "hard shells" they go their way and the others goes their
way....about the church.
AL: In the "hard shells" it's possible for everybody to express themselves,
I mean, there aren't any preachers in the hard shells, are there?.....
Every person's a preacher....
Stan: Every person's a preacher. And like I said, there's three come here,
they spread out and built a new church down on the hill. They come here,
and my wife's pretty bashful, you know, and didn't want 'em 'round here,
so they come in, 3 of 'em. and he said "We come up, and why don't you go
down and join that church?" And I said "Your church?" and he said "Our
church." I said "What's your trouble?" He said, "Oh, we couldn't get
along on the other side and we just built a new church." Well, I said,
"I'll tell ya, if you can't get along there, you can't get along here either,
and there ain't but one church. Only one church is what there is." And
he said "What?!" I said, "Only one church, and that's the church of
Christ." There's a lot of denominations, but there is only one church,
the Church of Christ, you know, that's what you got inside. But if they
can't get along in there, they can't get along in here either.
