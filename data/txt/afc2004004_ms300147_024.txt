Mr. Alan, Lomax,
Dear, Sir.
Quite a few ago, I mailed six songs to
you. I'm very sorry to say I have rec. no
reply from you as yet. i, realise too
sir, you are quite a busy man.
You did promise how ever you would
send me some money.
I would highly appreciate a very small
sum as a xmas gift.
I would like to hear from you at once.
Wishing you, and yours, a Merry Christmas.
Yours Truly,
Bridges Lee Cole.
