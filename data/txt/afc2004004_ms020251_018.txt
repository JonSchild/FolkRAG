BOB YOUNG'S RAISIN' WHOOP  37

This is from Bob Young, Back up in Fitzgerald. Bob used to wake
up the people before day, so they could get 
ready to go to work at the turpentine camps. Bob was a great
gum dipper, himself.  He would get up early in the morning
and go all over the countryside with his loud whoop, his call.
People said they could hear him six miles away.  He would stand
on a hill and put his hands to his mouth and holler:

Nigger, raise up,
Nigger, raise up,
Nigger, raise up,
And get your coffee,
Lawdy, Lawd,
Captain is a mean man,
Captain is a mean man,
Captain is a mean, old, doggone Captain,
Lawdy, Lawd.

Niggers, raise up,
Niggers, raise up,
Niggers, raise up 
And get your four-day coffee,
Lawdy, Lawd...

And sometimes he would holler:

Eeeeeer, er-a, er!
Eeeeeer, er-a, er!
Er-a-er-a, er-a-er-a,
E-er-a-eeeeeeeeeeeer.
