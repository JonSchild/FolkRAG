Dear Miss Davis:

One June 25 I will be in Bloomington, Indiana
teaching at the Summer School of Folk Lore of Indiana
University. One of my sceduled classes falls
on Thursday so that it looks like it will be impossible
for me to come. You might write Stith Thompson,
chairman of the English Department in Indiana, and
ask him whether it would be possible to arrange for
me to come up at that time. If it is I would be
glad to come, but it has to be up to him. I presume
that you plan to take care of my expenses for the 
trip; otherwise it would be out of the question. I
am sorry there are these problems because otherwise 
I would be delighted to meet with you.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
