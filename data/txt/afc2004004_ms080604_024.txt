buckle the Johnson bar the hook  team stops, if they're
trained. And all you got to do just knock your hitch out.
Well then the two mules carried it on to the dump.  Alright,
they got a wheeler, a spider up there.  You bring it up
there. . now he may be lookin cross the river somewhere, and
he'd take a stick -a clod a dirt and chuck it, and you got to
dump it where he chuckered that.  And if you didn't chucker
that, got a root 'cross your head, see.  Alright, then they
had somethin about wide as from here (gesturing), it wasn't
wide as from here to that pole over there (pointing ahead
and speaking to Bill Gordon), was it?
B.G.:
No. . .  (fresno?).
W.B.:
No.  About as wide as from here to that pole
here (points closer, in front of him) called a (fresno?).
When you dump it, he drag it down.  Now, when he tripped
that wheeler, he didn't just pile all the dirt up there,
he scattered it out as he went on.  Then he'd take that
(fresno?) and he'd come back and he would dress it off.
B.G.:
He'd take the place of the bulldozer.
W.B.:
Yeah, in the place what they used for a 
bulldozers and motor-graters now, they used (fresno?) for
that.  And the (Nayce?) camp may have slips.  Now that's
something with two handles, and a man got to get behind it
and put it in the dirt and try to hold it down low enough for
to keep it from goin in the ground so deep that it throw him
over between the mules, see.  So you had to get down there
with it.  Well then when it get loaded, then the man that's
drivin the slips, he stand up on the handles of it for to
keep it from goin in the ground, throwin him over between the
mules.  Now the Nayce camp, might have --done got out with
them ol dirt crawlers, you see.  It just depend upon how much
money that the man had and what price of equipment and how
much of it that he could afford.
A.L.:
Each of those contractors would contract to do
so much work for so much money.
W.B.:
That's right.  And you may have. .  just a 
thousand station, which they call a station a hundred feet.
You may just have a thousand feet of levee in here to do, and
they may be doin it from here to a mile, which is about
twenty-five miles, see.  But now, it'd be fifteen, ah, twenty
contractors in there doin the levee, see.  But now, you may
contract a thousand feet of you may contract two thousand
