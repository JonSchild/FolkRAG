The present Negro high schools of Shelby County are of comparatively
recent development and, because of their organization and leadership, are becoming
an important factor in the life of the Negro youth of the county. Significantly,
in this type of County, in which the control rests substantially
in a large urban center, the consolidated Negro high schools in particular
came from the outside, and frequently over the objection of local white residents.
The city exerts more of its impersonal control over the organization
of the school. In a country without such influence the schools, elementary and
secondary, tend more to reflect the wishes and tolerances of the locality.
These schools are in part at least a recognition of the utility of the Negro
votes to the very effective political machine of this county and the central
city. The contrast between these schools and the local elementary system
throws some light on the contrasting roles of the school in a stable system
and in community development.

Geeter High school is the largest rural Negro high school in the
state, and the only school for Negroes in the county with a school bus. It
is located nine miles south of Memphis in the community known as Whitehaven.
There are 648 students and 19 teachers. Since the students travel as much
as twenty miles a day to and from school, the problem of transportation was
a serious one before the school acquired the bus. Originally, the bus was
owned and operated by the students, but recently the county replaced the old
bus with a new one and gave some assistance in the maintenance of it.

In addition to academic subjects, carpentry, masonry, automobile
service, and agriculture are taught the students in the well-equipped shops.
The principal has been able to secure most of the equipment his school needs
