The rumors in this group were collected by a busy dentist whose
clientele is made up of people from practically all walks of life,
and his office is located in a town-town medical arts building.

He said he did not hear quite the type of rumors we were requesting,
but thought we might want the criticisms inasmuch as they were gathered
from his patients over a period of a few days.  Two of them he has written
himself and the others were notes he requested his secretary to take down.
