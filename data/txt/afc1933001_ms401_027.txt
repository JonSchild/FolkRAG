Iron Head probably never will see Central State Farm  no 1
again. Less than a year after the Governor set him free I
found him in the garden squad of the Ramsey State Convict
Farm. He peered past me through the iron bars of his cell.
Once more he was a convict longing for the "free world."
I asked him what had happened. "Well, I got hard up and did
a little porch climbin'" (the swag amounted to more than a
thousand dollars). Iron Head has once explained why he had
become a thief. "Those Jew merchants on Deep Ellum in Dallas
had so many goods they piles 'em out on the sidewalks. [I
just took what I needed.] They didn't need what I stole. I never did do no work. My Grandma
raised me. Ever day she gave me my dinner in a bucket and
sent me to school. I never got there. But mostly I stole
from niggers. The law didn't pay no 'tention when niggers
lost their belongings. I'd watch a house till the women
folks went away. Then I'd go in and take what I wanted."
    Later when Iron Head's singing brought him some money,
I suggested that we save it, go back to Dallas and restore
the value of the stolen goods. He rejected the idea bluntly.
"They had plenty. They never missed what I took."
    He often expressed a wish to hunt again for some stolen
jewelry that he buried and "couldn't find the place no mo'."
    One time during our stay in my home in Austin I left Iron
Head alone in the house for several hours. Afterward he said
to me, "Boss, while you wus gone I went all over the house.
I saw jewelry lyin' around. I saw money, too. I never tetched
nothin'. 'My boss man is trustin' me. I felt mighty good,"
