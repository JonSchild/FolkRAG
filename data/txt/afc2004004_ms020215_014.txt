[*(FOREIGN LANGUAGES)*]

BJ:      (Cont.) Elisha asked him where'd he get it from.
He told him that he 'cided that he need pay. Just like I
say, "I know you all hada got paid an' I went an' got it an' gi' 
it to ya, ya see."
     He says, "Now, the lepers that was upon him will be upon
you," see?  "An' your children," see?  An' so that's where the
leprachauns come in there.  See?  Right there from cheatin' an'
swindlin'.  Ha, so it cain't be hoped (helped), can it?  An' so,
you can find it there.  Sometime I'll get, I'll get my big Bible
an' show it to ya.  But ah, hi', hit's in the trunk.
     But ah, I was jus' sayin' that they, [ah] um, at that time, they
would ah -- they wasn't no difference.  Peoples, People didn't look on
peoples as as that, even after that come on 'em.  But they was lef'
out.  Went out to themselves where they [life] language an' everything
changed; it goes on to show you there in the Bible, where they
language change an' they, an' they got in plain language where,
ah, where He sent some out in plain language, where they would
understand.  You know, sent some of the peoples to the country
where the plain language spoken.
     I didn', I didn' think this kind of language spoken.  I
don't know where it this yet; might not a-been this.  Mighta been
jes' somethin' plainer than what they was doin' then.  Because I 
don't think that this kin' here, 'cause this ain', this here is
somethin' broke[n] up an' tore up to make somethin' there, ain' it?
But it made good; I like it, ha! I like it, the way it made.
'Cause those folks over there, how they ever get through, I [don't] never gonna
under that zzzz, zhuzh. Goo'ness alive. Yes sir.
