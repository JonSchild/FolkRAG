BJ   9-25   P. 3

BJ:     Oh, I did.  I saw many of those (curious ?) things ov' there.
An' those...whatchacallem ol' things?...them ol' pompus (porpoises)
an' things.  I saw a real one; the water had lef' one there.  In the
tide had lef' a pompus -- so they say didn' have enough water to
swim in.  That was a big, funny thing to me, ha, ha.  I seen him pretty
good; like a mule layin' out there on the water.  Until the tide come
back, y'know.  An' he struck water.  I didn' see him when he struck 
water, but the people say he really go (swell? fast?) when that water get
deep enough for him to go...An', uh, we caught lot a' fishes out
there, through, about, that pompus, too.  'Cause the pompus drive
fishes up in them lil' schools, of [nets] necks, y'know.   An they would
take nets and go up ahead of the pompus.  You know, an' throw 'em
out.  Boy, you gots some fish there.  Oh -- fish, fish, fish.  All
kin's.  'Cause they would drive them up.  An' you see a schools of
pompus drivin' up, you jus' go up ahead of 'em, you know, after they
drive 'em into a little neck of water...an', uh, you can throw that...
an' one day -- I like to go fishin' down there -- it's the first
time I fished on Sunday, was down there, -- an' I was a scared chile.
You go along with other peoples, you jus' do what other folks done.
y'know.  An I didn' wanna stay at the place by myself; I went down
with all the crowd; they was fishin'.  They would get down -- climb
down -- this ladder.  They was goin' down on this -- I call it a table --
where that trestle turns around there.  A lot of the mens would, y'know,
but we [?] ladies would stay up, an' throw over, and fish, y'know. for us,
y'know?  So I was fishin' and I had a, oh, a great pull.  I wanted a'
pull 'im.  He was, he was, comin up, right on a Sunday.  An' I
hadn't thought about it when I pulled him up, it bein' Sunday.  But I
had thought about it at all other times., thinkin' that it was Sabbath
an' it was wrong.  'bout fishin' on Sunday.  So, I pulled this ol' fish
up -- oh, he was a big one; he weighed eleven pounds or sumpin'.  I
pulled that thing up there, and got 'im up, by the time I got 'im on the
on the track up there --  he's sayin', "Boom-a, boom-a, boom-a.
[He say, "]Dooma-dooma, dooma,-dooma"  (This is a deep bass voice
from BJ) Way!  Goodness alive!  I say, "Throw 'im back; throw 'im back;
he's talkin'."  I was so scared.  Woo... I hadn't never caught one
like that.; he was a drum.  Ha, I didn't know what he was.  Whoo, I
was so scared.  An so they all tol' me what he was and they kep'him.
But I had yet to look at that fish; I didn't like that thing .  Seem
