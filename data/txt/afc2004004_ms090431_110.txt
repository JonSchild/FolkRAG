Shoo Fly.

Hey. shoo fly.
Ha ha.
Ladies' bow tie,
ha ha.
Gentleman's neck tie,
ha ha.
Repeat twice more.

This game is about 30 years old, and the children play it by holding
one hand, the left and right, together and the bop.
A: What do you mean?
They do a step, that is, they fly with the feet along and stomp on the
ground. I've known children to do that for 30 years.
A: What is the age?
Any age children can do it.

OLD COW DIED.

The old cow died
In the cool water.
Give me the golden chain.
Repeat.

Dip your head
In the cool water.
Give me the golden chain.
Repeat.

This game by the children forming a long line and start at the head of
the line and go on the arms. And they keep winding the chain down until
they get to the last two, and then they go under arm.

Chick-A-Ma-Chick.

Chick a ma chick,
My crown or crow.
I went to the well
To wash my toe.
When I got back
My black-eyed chicken was gone.
What time, old witch? One.

Repeat but second stanza, the answer is two, and so on.

They sing the song until the children get to the last one in line,
and then the old hen asks the hawk "What are you looking for?" And he
said, "I'm looking for a needle." And the hen say, sticks out her foot
and says, "Is this it?" "No." The other foot, the arm, the other arm, 
and finally she asks her head, "Is this it?" And he says, "No." And 
all the chickens do that until he gets to the last one.
