he didn't want to make the vide to Anse-a-Veau
with us. After considerable stalking he walked ahead
through the darls [?] to put us under the care of the
chef de section and it was [troui?] behind his broad back
we saw the red roof of Anse A. Veau's cathedral
looking out to sea. It shadows a little
wht [?] where the French [bea] brought their caravels
three centuries ago. The kind capt. of the gendarmes
gave us the guard's truck for the vide into the vagoane
I didn't see the country in between, my head
was leaping up and down on my guitar case
and [it was] my mind was vaguely through
shattered dreams trying to explain the bounding
leaping & roaring of the camion. We picked 
up a ride in a freight truck to Carrefour [?]
Defors where Moscosso was born and from
there to Port-au-Prince we rode a commercial
camion with visits to the chauffeur's 
mistress, wife & friends by the way we made
PaP by 8 PM, making us 16 hours on
the road without food and with little 
sleep. Even R. was tired. The first sip of
soup at the hotel was like ambrosia, the 
fourth was like vegetable soup.
