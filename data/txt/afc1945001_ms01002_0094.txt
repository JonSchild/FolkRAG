Hon. Archibald MacLeish,
Director,
Office of Facts and Figures,
Washington, D.C.

My dear Mr. MacLeish:

I have read with interest the confidential
statement dated January 17, 1942, entitled A PROJECT
FOR THE ANALYSIS OF RUMORS, prepared jointly by
Messrs. Dubois of the Office of Facts and Figures,
Potter of the Office of the Coordinator of Information,
and Williams of this office. The cooperative
relations and the general plan suggested in the memorandum 
have my approval.  If you are in agreement on 
this plan, I shall formally instruct Mr. Williams to
work on the organization of the program with your
representative and a representative of the Office of
the Coordinator of Information, in accordance with
the cooperative plan suggested in the memorandum.

The arrangement for a Rumor Clinic suggested
in the memorandum seems to me to be quite satisfactory.
I do not need to assure you that this Office will do
everything possible to achieve the purposes of the idea
in so far as our proper field of operation is concerned.

Very cordially yours, 

[J. W. Studebaker]
Commissioner.

CC Mr. Williams.
