Gentlement:
I am enclosing a leaflet which turned
up at the U. S. Patent office today.  To the
best of my knowledge it springs from some
plant in Brooklyn, engaged in manufacture
of parts for Sperry gyroscopes

It's a good joke, but there is more 
to it than meets the eye, to my mind.  
I believe that you are interested in this
sort of thing; if not, you may forward
the leaflet to the proper office.

Sincerely, 
L. Smilow
