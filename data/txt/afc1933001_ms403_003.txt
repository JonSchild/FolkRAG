pay a hundred dollars for the rest of the words. Well, I had'Em there,for the
first verse was the obly one I did not have already."

Captain Nye is now about sixty-three years old; he has never been
married and lives alone, sustained by his singing in addition to food and
lodging furnished by "relief" stipend. He is large and jolly, has a trim beard,
blue eyes, a pleasing smile and a beautiful resonant speaking and singing voice.

Captain Nye insisted in recording the whole ofevery ballad.
"Remember," he said,"these songs and ballads wre not to be abbreviated.
Use the whole or not at all. To abbreviate kills them."

His mother's grandfather sang some of his songs.
