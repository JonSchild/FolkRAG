shouted over many miles to the Southwest
to Raymondsville, then due East into
the King Ranch to San Ferita, a village
made up of the peons of this ranch.
Away out in the brush from this
town we came finally to the home 
of Polo Abrega, a King Ranch vaquero 
of high distinction, and his
smiling, buxom and their nine children.
Also present after a long
search drifting in from the horizon
came Joe Gorney, guitarist and singer
extraordinary of "versos" and another
brand of balladistic music the
name of which escapes. Frank
says there is no such thing as a
corrida. The confusion, he claims,
arises from the word corrido, the
group of peregrinating vaqueros
on the hunt for cattle. They camp
where the night falls. And around
the camp fires "versos" are born.
