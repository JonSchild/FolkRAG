About f-----g a 92 year old 
woman. Had been taking 
her tobacco for a [no] year 
& one day I took the notion 
& I asked her - How wd 
you like about 8 inches 
of spring chicken shoved 
up in your bowels, I says. 
Oh no, Frank, she says 
I don't think I better. 
Paddy might find out. No
I says, [f] he won't find 
out unless you tell him 
because I won't. [Hell]
