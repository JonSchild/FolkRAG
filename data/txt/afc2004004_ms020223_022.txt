[*GOOD STORY: WHITE MOB MURDERS A
NEGRO WITH RETALIATION 1918?*]

a wacked (wicked) place, saw mill place. Ya know, turpentine
and saw mill. And they used to fight down in there...
TL: Is this in Miami?
BJ: Ah, out from Fitzgerald. An' they used to fight down there,
ah, an' have rough times. A rough place. Somethin' like...ah...
you know. I'll tell ya: It's a place where the, ah, man don't,
don't allow no police at. See? He don't 'low sheriff to 'res'
(arrest) his hands unlessen he says so. An' you know what that
mean? When strangers come in there, they -- some of 'em -- treat
ya nice an' some of 'em wouldn't, ya see?
AL: And loads of the people who went there were people who were
runnin' away from something or other?
BJ: Well, they go to the dances an' things, but of course, it's
a big place. Sometime you know people an' you get along all right.
But if anything started down there, you jus' in it; that's all.
Unlessen you friendly with them or, [you know,] sumpin' like that, you know.
Jes', it's jes' a place where they call, call, I would call it
a outlaw. It's about 12 mile from Brafson (?), around, [12] and 12 from
Fitzgerald, sumpin' like that.
AL: Didn't they have kinda famous men that ran in those camps?
BJ: Yeah! A lot of [them] rough cats. That's them big cats, the
rough cats. Ah, he had two -- there's two brothers of 'em. I
stayed -- That-that's where I stayed up there, ya know. Wi'
one of 'em. On the other end, ya know, up to, up to Abbottville,
that side, one of the brothers. They were Crum Williams an'
Wyatt Williams. An' um, Crum was really bad, ya know. He wasn'
jokin' about his'n; he's bad. An' Wyatt, he's a very nice guy,
but he jus' don't 'low none of the sheriffs to 'rest none of
his hands 'lessen he says so.
AL: Is this the one you told me about, the one that drank?
