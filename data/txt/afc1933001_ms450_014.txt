When the tourist boats and the tourist planes dock in Nassau, 
they are met by one or several of the town's street bands. These bands, 
(banjo, one or two guitars, mandolin and rattle) sing and play Bahaman 
hot arrangements of Bahaman folk-dance tunes. At night they go over the
hill and improvise even hotter arrangements for the "round dances"-- foxtrots,
one-steps, etc.-- which have recently become increasingly popular
in the islands. The following tunes, examples of this "sophisticated" genre,
are signposts of future development in Bahaman folk music
