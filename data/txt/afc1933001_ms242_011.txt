Dear Alan: Jason met me
in Denver, liked the radio
programs, wishes me to help
make 6 shorts - offers all
expenses $250.00 cash for each
short and 25% of all
the profits of the 6 shorts

The musicians of Denver
liked the records, the public
was sympathetic. Reproduction
very poor. At Colorado [City]
Springs a Columbia B.S.
man played the Chisholm Trail
and the Blues to a most enthusiastic
audience who cheered and cheered
and begged for more.
