attempted to accompany this song [*on his guitar*].  He is most likely to 
moan it when he is entirely occupied
and alone with work of some kind [*;*]  ]*a*]and the
" holler"  will adapt itself, at such times, to his
thoughts.  For example: 
Late onez evening, not many days before Christmas, 
[*at the end of*] a hard days drive 
Lead Belly was [*still*] at the wheel.  Nothing had been said for miles.
We were all weary and cold.  L.B. began to moan under his
breath 
'o]*h*]--ho--, baby; 
Christmas comin'; 
Christmas comin' ,  Christmas comin' , 
Oh---[*ho*]-------.
I'm a long ways from home,  long ways from home,
O  Marthy, long ways from you." 

and so on, informing his soul how cold it was, how lonesome
this strange country was, and how hard it was on a man not 
to be home [*at*] Christmas [*time*]  One reason for this complaint
against life was, we believe, that he knew he would [*again*] miss his 
annual Christmas drunk and gorge[*.*] a[*n*] ancient folk custom 
[*was religiously adhered to by country Negroes in the South. *] 

And again, in  New York, he was washing dishes, 
alone in the kitchen, filling the whole apartment with his
resolve not to go down "to de well no mo'."  The telephone
rang.  As I hurried to answer, I heard L.B. 
shout, 
"Telephone's a-ringin', 
Telephone's a-ringin',  ringin', 
o=O[*h*]-------------, 
An' de people'z is a-singin', 
Great God, a-singin'."
