Dear Sir:

I judge that your establishment publishes theoretical works in folklore and
Anthropology. During the period of my [t]Rockefeller grant, I developed three methods
for precise analysis of folksong performance:
1) A 37 parameter coding system for performance itself. The coding system is complete
and it runs to 75 pages.
2) The phonotactics  article - about 45 pages, accompanied by about 40 diagrams in
three colors. It locates the vowels in sample verses of songs in the Smith-Trager
phonetic chart. These series of vowels are then connected by colored lines
thus portraying the movement between vowels. The complex of lines then results
in abstract diagram of a stanza. These diagrams can be compared by inspection.
Each region makes its own type of picture.
3) A visible speech analysis of voice qualities locating about 30 qualities on visible
speech machine prints. The pictures themselves can be grouped by region and style.
Voice qualities can be roughly judged, by eye, by assemblages of lines.
4) Song structure and social structure:
a) A statement about similarities between shape of sin[k]ging group and fundamental
leader-group relations in a series of culture areas. This article is to be
published in "Ethnology".
5) I planned a long piece on the results of the performance coding syste[.]m.

These five pieces should make a fairly sizable book and there must be a large number of
cuts since the methods are all by visual inspection. Please let me know your reaction
to this notion. I'll be back from the field about the middle of August.


Yours sincerely,
