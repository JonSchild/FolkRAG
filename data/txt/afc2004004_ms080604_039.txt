W.S.H.:

Walter Brown:
     I used to pull a beauty. . . I used to pull a
beauty for (A. T. Rogers?) at St. George, Louisiana, and he
used to give me good. . (W.S.Hart breaks into laughter) I had
me some willow-- skin off a willow tree?, and I patterned me
a whip (more laughs from W.S.H.).  And when she get up there,
and I'd throw the (dog-end?) ,  I would pop it, and she (start
up headin?) for it.  (more laughter) I'd, (makes noise:) "Wah-goo!"
(laughs) I used to love that!
A.L.:
     You mule skinners could hit a mule. .  hit it
with a whip anywhere you wanted to hit, couldn't you?
W.S. Hart:
     Oh yeah!  Under the foot?  -Take the line. . .
B. Gordon:
     You hit right up under the front shoulder and
knock em down.
W. Brown:
     Never put a whip on 'em-- I used to drive
oxens.
B.G.:
     Take that leather line an hit a mule right up
under their front shoulder?, he fall just like you shot him
in the heart.
W.B.:
     I had two oxens.  And I used to get (tuber?)
gum out of a bottom that could nothin else go in.  And they
had much (sense?) as I did.  I didn't have to follow em out.
All I had to do just stay there and hook em up and they
would knock the tongue loose when they get to the dump.  Bob
and Jane --I never will forget 'em.  You could take two trees,
about that far apart (gesturing), if both of em couldn't go
through there?, with them yokes on em? --one of em would go
through first and turn around and let the other one come
through.  They would back up and they would drag that log
