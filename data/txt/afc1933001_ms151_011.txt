Memo to Dr. Harold Spivacke
Chief of Music Division
Library of Congress
As you know, Dr. Ivan Walton of the University
of Michigan assisted me materially during my Michigan
trip in 1938. At that time I promised him duplicates
of records which he assisted me in collecting and you
approved the recommendation. On his recent visit to
the Archive he picked out the records which he wished
to have, to the number of forty. I should like to
recommend that these records be duplicated and sent to
him as soon as my be.
My ten day trip to Vermont resulted in 76 twelve
inch acetate records of excellent quality. I should
like to recommend that we make a duplicate set of these
records for Mrs. Flanders. She plans, by the way, to
have certain of these records sent out in the Vermont
State Traveling Library which goes to country schools.
[It would be wise for all of these records to be
copied in duplicate and to reserve one set of the duplicates
for our own files to serve, from that time on, as master
duplicates. The total number of discs required then
will be 232. I shall supervise the duplication myself.]
