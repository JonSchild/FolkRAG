3rd R. of 10/12/61, P. 22, Song 1, Cont

No, I didn't like the way they did, 
But the Lawd followed me, 
Although my sin was hid
Until the Lawd followed me. 
That preacher looked at me, 
All of my means (meanness?) he seemed to see, 
And he told it out in public
And the Lawd followed me. 
I'm glad he followed me, 
So glad he followed me, 
I'm glad he
And he followed me. 
My life was very bad, 
My heart was very sad
But I'm so glad 
That the Lawd followed me. 
Oh, I tried to think I was bad
But the Lawd followed me, 
And that shoutin' made me mad, 
You see, the Lawd followed me. 
Oh, I thought I knowed it all, 
But my pride, it took a fall
And His name I had to call
'Cause the Lawd followed me. 
I'm glad he followed me, 
So glad he followed me, 
I'm glad he's 
He followed me.
