BJ TAPE 15, p. 18
y-you got a friend somewhere there in the country an' like 
him well? You tell him about that person; you git him to pick 
that same man to go work with him. 'Cause he was honest. He, he.
he didn' steal it; he tuk it. He was gonna take it. Bold to ya 
face, that's all.
An' one, one, one colored man went into the Post Office there
in Fitzgerald a long time ago. Broke in there? An' when the, 
when the man opened the Post Office he was settin' down there. 
He asked 'im what he doin'.
He said, "I broke in so you can put me in jail...On the chain 
gang. 'Cause I ain't got no work ta do an' I'm hongry an' I don't, 
don't wanna steal nothin'. I jus' wantcha to arrest me."
They called all them peoples there together an' everything an' 
talked wit' 'em an' everything an' got 'im a good job an' a nice 
little farm! had a wife an' 3 children. Huh, ha, ha! But say, 
"Put me in jail." 'Cause know they put him in jail, they gonna 
take care a the wife. See?
So that's what he did. Now, that's just honest confession. 
All he wanted -- They say they wasn't nothin' moved, nothin' 
touched. He was sittin' down. An' broke in there. So tha's 
jes' the way some peoples does. Makes it honest.
