LOMAX NARRATION #4   -9

     What's this guy's name that I'm
talking. . .okay.  [Octa Clark,] the, the classic Cajun [fait
de do] artist singing with his polka faced grin playing a
bluesy note with his anchor accordion style. .makes an
incredible contrast to the, to, to the black [zidaco]
performance of, of the [Delphas] Band.  With the, his son on
the [UNCLEAR] weaving like reeds in the wind of the, in the,
in the, in the stream of the rhythm.  Syncopating with long
curving strokes his, his rhythms, his scratchy rhythms.
Syncopating in long curvy strokes with his father's popping
notes on the accordion.  And Delphas breaking Jolie Bond up
into short African type phrases, each one touched with the
rye quality, with the rye sound of the blues.

playing and, European and black performance style.  The
European orchestra wind and strings in an accompanying
relationship, the black orchestra percussion and winds in
polyrhythm.  Where, how did this polyrhythmic orchestra
survive in Louisiana?  My guess is that it lasted in
the. . .no, it survived in Louisiana.  We found an early
version of it. . .Delpha. . . .no.  Let's see.  Let's start from
there.
     In polyrhythm, Mike Ducet and I late one
night in [Ville Platt] lay. . . .no. . . .polyrhythm.  Late. . .one,
let's see, one, one midnight in a, in a bar in Ville Platt
