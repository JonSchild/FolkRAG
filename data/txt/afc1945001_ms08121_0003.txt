Contribute, son to science
Advance the common good
Compound a hair restorer,
produce for Hollywood
Invent a shocking weapon,
Make debuts at the Met,
Or else you wont be paying
Society your debt.

To find excuse for being
Write plays about Bataan
Devise a meatless menu
Dance ballet with elan
Be priestly, psychiatric
Improve the sulfa pill
Of Course if you don't want to
Some other fellow will.
