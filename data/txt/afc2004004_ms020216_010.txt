[*DIFFERENT CHURCHES*]

BJ:    No, I don't think that.

AL:    You don't?
BJ:     I don't think that. I believe that somebody in the Church 
mean all they know.  In every church, under Heaven.  An' now, 
tha's my belief.  I b'lieve every church under Heaven, I don't 
care how it's carried out an' what it done, I b'lieve somebody there 
mean all they know.  For God.  B'cause, ya see, the Lawd say that, 
you know, that ah, he said, "I have other sheeps, of this fold." 
You see. "I have other sheeps that are not of this fold.  And 
them, too, I mus' call."  Ya see? An' then He go on to say again, 
"Even. . .Even everyone that b'lieves in my name."  Ya see? An' so 
at that work, ya know, you's dip with with deeper spirit and higher 
depths, ya know, an' diffrunt things.

It's jus' like education. You know what I mean? Some folks 
is got it, an' other -- you know jus' like you got education enough to 
do all these diffrunt things; there's some [of 'em] ain't got that 
much education, but they yet goin', jus' like you go.  Ya see, but 
yet, still you, you, you ain't got as much as they got.  You got 
to be dipped, and deep.  You know , as we got peoples in the Church 
now an' in Missionary Baptist an' other churches, too, they're higher 
than the other; they got to be.  Jesus say, "Call for the elders 
of the Church," you know, "That they pray for ya."  Well, he 
said -- it don't mean jus' his age; it mean the 
understandin' an' the one that is, is elder in Christ, ya know. 
Knowin' how to do an' what to do. [They] And suffer for Him an' know 
what to do, jus' like a mother an' a father.  You know, see. An' so. . .

AL:    Bessie, what is the difference, then, between what the 
Missionary Baptist believe and what you believe now, as a 
Holiness person?
