MA RCH!  MARCH!                                                             -6-
(Sheet Music - G. Schirmer Co.)

March, March marchm march,
March, comrades, march along,
March, March, march, march,
March, a hundred million strong!
On through dark and battle's roar!
On where none has dared before.
On to pay the age's score, 
March, march, march.
Forward, comrades, march, march for ever,
Up with the break of day,
Out on the trackless way,
Ours the will that must and can,
Ours to crown creation's plan,
Ours to win the world for man:
March, comrades, march!

March, March march, march,
March, comrades, march along,
March, March, march, march,
March, a hundred million strong!
One in vision, one in will,
We shall carry Zion's hill,
God is in His heaven still 
March, march, march.
Forward, comrades, march, march for ever!
Up with the break of day,
Out on the trackless way,
Ours the heart to dare and do,
Ours the promised land to view,
Ours to build the world anew,
March, comrades, march.

DIXIE LAND
(America)
(Page 178 - Old Favorite Songs)

I wish I was in de land ob cotton, old time dar am not forgotten!
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
In Dixie Land whar I was born in, early on on frosty morning,
Look away! Look away! Look away! O Dixie Land.

Chorus: Don' I wish I was in Dixie, Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray!
In Dixie Land, I'll take my stand, to lib and die in Dixie.
Away, away, away, down south in Dixie.
