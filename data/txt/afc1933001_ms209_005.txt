I was gratified to read of your 
successes, particularly that some
pecuniary reward came your 
way. In the system in vogue,
decry it as we may, that is one
way to measure personal values.
If I were advising I should
now re-emphasize what I before
have said. But you have won 
your freedom, after too long suffering
from my mentorship. Unless
I become hopelessly senile I am 
done. One principle the years 
taught me: people able to pay for
their pleasure and willing think
more of you when you demand
$100 00 than for a piggling $25.
The Cosmos Clubs talks will
probably yield you large future
returns unless counteracted
by influences entirely
unconnected with folk songs.
