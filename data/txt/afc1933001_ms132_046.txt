Dear Dr. Lomax:

I regret very much that I could not be in Goshen during your
recent visit here.  The glowing reports that Mrs. Umble and
Roy gave me of your work here have made me very eager to meet
you and your assistant.  They greatly appreciated the oppor-
tunity to meet you and render whatever little assistance they
were able to give.

I hope that the records which you made will be available for
general distribution.  How may we secure copies of them and
at what cost?  We are trying to make a study of this Amish
music but for reasons which are clearer to us since you
visited here we have been able to make very little progress.

Eli Bontrager wrote me a letter since my return, which "in
the interest of science," I probably should communicate to
you verbatim.  I have called at his home several times, but
he has been visiting relatives in Michigan.  He states that
he is unwilling to sing any more for recording purposes.
I do not know what I shall be able to do with him but will
report to you if we are able to make him change his mind.

These Amish east of Goshen are very patriotic in their way.
That is, they have profound respect for the present Democratic
Administration.  I have been thinking that we might be able 
to influence him by continuing the same strategy which I
used at first to gain his consent to the recording of the
hymns.  When I had my conference with Mr. Bontrager relative
to "writing down" these hymn tunes, I have him the impression
