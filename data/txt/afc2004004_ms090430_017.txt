VARIATIONS IN RURAL BACKGROUNDS

Active Plantation Areas

Bolivar and Coahoma, Mississippi

Bolivar and Coahoma Counties in Mississippi are in the most prosperous 
section of the active plantation belt. Here are to be found, in this 
rich Delta area, the largest Negro population concentrations, the highest 
tenancy rates, the greatest plantations, and the single, unvarying commercial 
crop of cotton. Although in many respects the two counties are similar, 
Bolivar County is unique in having one of the few surviving all-Negro 
towns in the South. Mound Bayou, with its Negro town officials, land owners
and small business men, is an anomaly in the state and in the Delta, but extremely interesting in itself. 

These two counties are in the western tier of Mississippi counties 
bordering the Mississippi river, and in the center of the Yazoo-Mississippi 
Delta. Their chief asset is in the almost inexhaustably fertile soil. For 
centuries the Mississippi has been depositing here the rich top soil of the 
North and Northwest. Floods have fought with drainage ditches and g[ ] 
levees. These periodic inundations have not yet weakened the hold or the [ ] 
of planters who found in this rich loam and buckshot soil a constant sou[ ] 
of profit. Some of these soils have been in continuous cultivation for [ ] 
a hundred years and still produce good yields of crops.
