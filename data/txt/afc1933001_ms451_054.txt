[1665]1664 A (Cont.)

 Louie stayed and he finally got a job at a place in New
York called "The Nest," run by Johnny Carey and he wrote
this number as a kind of theme and named it--no, Louie
Russell is not a sissy--he wrote this number and called it,
"Call of the Freaks" finding there was so many freaks in the 
city of New York that was so bold they would do anything for
a dollar and a half.

When he started to playing this thing why they would
start walking. They all become to know the tune. They would
throw their hands way up high in the air and keep a-stride with
the music and walking, and of course they used to have a little
verse in here that goes like this:

Stick out your can, here comes the garbage man,
Stick out your can, here comes the garbage man,
Yes, stick out your can, here comes the garbage man, 
Yes, stick out your can, here comes the garbage man.
(The freaks would be marching, I'm telling you.)
Stick out your can, here comes the garbage man.
(They would stick themselves out in the rear.)
