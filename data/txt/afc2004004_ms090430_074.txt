and is an imposing structure. It was the first brick house built in Whitehaven,

Few of the families raise the food required, and since they have
little or no money with which to buy supplies they rely upon their landlords
for advances for food and clothing over the work season. In Shelby
County many landowners do not operate commissaries, but establish credit
for tenants at a neighboring store.

The chief items in the diet are cornbread, biscuits, sorghum, and
whippoorwill peas. The latter, grown at the request of the Government as
a soil conservation measure, found a ready place in the unvaried menu of
the people. In the winter pork is added to the meals, for most families
raise their own hogs. Since the landlords assume no obligation for maintenance
of the tenants over the winter months, these tenants count heavily
upon their hog meat supply for winter food.

One response to the system is expressed in the mobility of the
tenants. Our figures covering 6,486 Negro families in the County show that
the average tenure is 3.6 years. This is slightly higher than in some counties
lower down, but high enough to reflect instability and insecurity. The
reasons given for the moving around suggest chiefly restlessness and a dull
sort of hope for something better. Here are some of their comments:

"I just got tired of staying in one place."

"I moves every year. I don't have any home of my own."

"I just moved. No reason at all except I wanted to move."
