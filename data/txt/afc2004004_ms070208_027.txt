George Adams - Farrell, Miss. July 29, 1942..
Frizzling shingles - house a turmoil of torn beds - 
floors rattling - wife, rheumatic - big butt - waddling
over an huge old-fashioned stove -
Geo. Adams - sitting bent and hollowchested and
lean at the edge of the rotten porch - spitting yellow flem
and the chickens pecking it up in the filthy tumbledown
backyard -
Geo is bright and lean - monkish, severe and 
bitter face - a rambler in levee camps with Bud
Doggett - a gunman who "has done more for the 
white folks than I have for the niggers" -
Knew Charly and Isum Lorentz and Charley 
Idaho - I'ze the cause of that man gettin' that place - 
was d s at That time & heard the plantation 
to be sold - CI had a contract on the levee, - 
told him on the levee - "If you git it you git 
a good place - 1500 acres "in cultivation."
You know that feller what he done
He was settin' at the dinner table & I was 
sittin' off from him. He went ridin'off
 he come back - say, "Geo"
I say "Suh"
"You shore as hell put me up to
somethin' -
