Dr. Gordon W. Allport

Cambridge, Massachusetts

Dear Dr. Allport:

Thanks for your words about Zawadski. We
will dispose of his paper as you suggest.

I would like you to know that our first bite
at the rumor problem (which produced 3,200 rumors from
all parts of the country and an intensive study by the
Surveys Division in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and
Portland, Maine) is beginning to provide a certain
amount of nutrition. Most important to us in the results
from this pilot study will be the definition of
a methodology for future rumor studies. When this paper
is completed I would like the privilege of sending it to
you for your criticism.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
