Dear Mr. Darling:
I am writing you about the very difficult time that my friends
and clients, Bessie Jones and the Sea Island Singers, had in
California as a result of somewhat amateurish handling of their
fees during their first trip there.  First of all, I feel that
you should have gotten in touch with me before you booked them
since I am acting as their unpaid manager until such  time as they
can find the proper one.  Second, I understand that you still
owe them $200, which they had to lay out for their return to
Georgia.  As almost a year has passed since this whole rather
unfortunate incident occurred, it seems to me that the time has
come for this obligation to be settled.  As you know, Mrs. Jones
is back in California, and I would very greatly appreciate your
settling with her there and letting me know when this is done.

I can quite understand how you got yourself into the situation
that you did.  It was a combination of over-enthusiasm and inexperience, 
and I certainly do not imply that there was anything
dishonest in the least degree in the whole episode.  I regret
that these friends of mine did suffer a hardship, and I do feel
that it is now time for the damage to be repaired.

Yours sincerely,
Alan Lomax
