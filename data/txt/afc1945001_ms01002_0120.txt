                                  RUMOR-CONTROL PROJECTS

The analysis of wartime rumors, and the creation of
agencies intended to combat rumors, requires the most expert
direction and execution.  Unskilled efforts at " rumor-busting"
can cause much harm by giving rumors publicity they might not
otherwise obtain.  Moreover, ineffective refutations can fix
rumors more firmly and powerfully in  the minds of those exposed 
to them.  Injudicious treatment of rumors may increase
public anxiety to the point where more of them spring up because
of the anxiety created.

The Office of War Information is prepared to co-operate
with responsible community agencies engaged in rumor-control
campaigns.  The Office of War Information cannot undertake to
answer specific rumors, except in rare instances, but it can
provide informational materials designed to eliminate the more
prevalent rumors by striking at their root-ignorance.

Community rumor-control projects have two main branches:
(1)  rumor collection and analysis and (2)  education.  These [must] should
work closely together, for the educational program [can] must be based
on a careful analysis of the content and implications of current
rumors.

Rumor-control projects will inevitably come into close
relations with newspapers and magazines.  Ordinarily such media
will be glad to make space available to the project, sometimes
for feature articles,  sometimes for regular releases.  In all
such cases, the direction and responsibility for what goes into
print must rest with the project directors and not with the
