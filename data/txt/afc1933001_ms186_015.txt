Dear Alan:-
I hope you have a good summer after you 
left Bloomington. For all I know, you may still
be out in the field; but when you do return to
Washington, may I have the Russell Ames
manuscript back from you, with comments, as
soon as possible? If it's good, I might be able 
to use it [*as a lead article*] for the April-June issue, about which
I am still very uncertain. But if it requires a
lot of re-working, I shall have to give Ames
time to do this - and get hold of him before he
is drafted. So I would appreciate its return.
Any news items you have will be most
welcome, at any time. A brief account of your
own field work this summer would be very 
acceptable, too. I shall appreciate whatever
cooperation you have the time and inclination
to give the Journal, and hope some day to have
an article from you, also. 
Mr. Boggs and I have run into a difference
of opinion concerning publication of his bibliography
in the Journal. I don't know how it will
work out. Originally, that was to be most of the April
issue.
As ever,      Erminie
