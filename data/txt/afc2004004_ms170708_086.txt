Then she came jumpin', skipping in,
Gave him such a joyful kiss,
Saying, "You're welcome home, kind husband dear,
Long time you have been missed, boys, missed,
Long time you have been missed."

So we'll bar the doors so neat and snug
And let us go to bed,
For the pain that do lay in my breat,
I can no longer rest, boys, rest,
I can no longer rest."

So he took a  stick an' he beat her so,
Till she was wonderful sore,
"Oh forbear, for bear," she cried, "husband dear,
I'll never do so no more, boys, more,
I'll never do so no more."

"For if you do I'll make you rue,
And curse the hour were born,
For deceiving of your husband dear,
I'll make you wear the horn, boys, horn,
I'll make you wear the horn."
