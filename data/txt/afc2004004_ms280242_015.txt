TAPE 89A- DAVY STEWART.
Davy: And he greeted so much he fell asleep among the hay. The
first thing - he wakened in the morning about 5 or 6 o'clock,
and the wee sheepies and lambs. The shepherds was herding sheep,
and the wee lambs were baaing. He whistled and the dog barked
(Davy imitates these) and the wee boy crawled out below the 
canvas cover of the rick of hay. The shepherd looked at him.
"And where did you come from, wee boy?"
"O, hold your tongue, shepherd. Me and my mother last nigh gaed
up to that farm-house and was in the barn, and we couldn't get
out the door - it was locked. They must have went away and sent
a loon for the doctor. I managed to get through the dung-hole and 
I took my mammy's basket with me. Here it is here."
The shepherd said, "Where's your mamy noo?"
"I heard her crying," he says, "through the night. She must be
killed."
The man says to the wee boy, "Come along with me." Went away and 
left sheep and all. They went away doon the road to a farmhouse,
tellt the man to yoke his horse to the trap. Drives to the 
town, to the police. They come out and they got the blood where
the woman was killed, but she was away. Aye, she was gone. I
think the man got ten years.
Lomax: Where didthat happen, Davy?
Davy: Up in Morayshire, Elgin.
Lomax: About how long ago?
Davy: 70 or 80 years ago.
Anne: Is it true really?
Davy: Oh yes. That's a true story?
Anne: That poor woman must have been so frightened.
Davy: They just cracked her on the head with this big cudgel,
killed her and away - the doctors away. But you see, the farmers
got paid for that.
Lomax: I thought it used to happen, too, in lodging houses, where
somebody would come in, and he wouldn't have any papers or
identification.
Davy: Aye, a few happened that same way. But it was mostly in
the farm-houses. The name of the doctors is a "clochter" or a 
"rudiegadjee" - mthat's in the cant. Or a howdiegadjee. "Gadjee"
means man.
Lomax: Can you tell Anne some cant because she's never heard any.
