Carry On!

(A poem of inspiration for discouraged brothers)

By G.R. Ingram, Pelto, N.D., Nelson County Secretary 

Beneath a lurid sky of crimson flame,
With bursting shrapnel, gas and star shell gleam
A soldier falter, fell beside his gun,
And whispered, "Buddy, hold the line and CARRY ON."

A toiler of the soil, with bowed down head,
Weary with toil, lay down upon his bed,
The hopeless toil that makes the man the slave,
Had overwhelmed the spirit once so brave.

Without the will to do, what chance of gain?
To what avail his work in sun and rain?
The spirit crushed ne'er soars so high again;
Surrender marks the end of Manhood's reign.

Oh, Brother, join the rank of men who dare,
To claim their own in God's free soil and air!
Dare you break faith with generations yet unborn
Resistless let your home and lands be shorn?

Turn ye your faces to the foe and fight,
The Union seeks to save you from your plight;
Before your homes and lands from you are gone,
Join with your Buddies, friend, and CARRY ON.

Step into the ranks for justice
For the man who farms.

Farmer's Union, Farmer's Union
Drive ahead with speed,
Dogs will growl and humans bark
To try your way impede.

Keep the bright on,
Give her gas on high
Fight Farmer-Union Soldier,
Ne'er say die.

Drive ahead co-operation
Make the old-line shake.
Cling together!

Break the old-line gang
Fire Farmer-Union Soldier
