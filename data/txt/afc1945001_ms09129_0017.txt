12A           I 
White

Hitler and Goebels were driving through 
the country. Their car accidentally struck
a small dog, killing it. Hitler was in 
a very sentimental mood on this morning. 
He commanded Goebels to go into the
farmhouse and tell the owners of the 
dog's death. 
After about fifteen minutes had passed
Goebels returned, his arms laden with
all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Hitler
demanded to know the meaning of all 
this. 
Goebels replied, "I did just as you said
sir." I marched in and said," Heil Hitler! The
dog is dead.
