Jean: I havena come to that part yet. You're going to hear
of a death, but I dinna think you're going to mourn, be just
broken-hearted. . . . . .And a little trouble here, too. But was
that your wish, that you would like to. . . . . . .
Lomax: No, you haven't hit it yet.
Jean: There's something here, Alan, that you're keeping back.
This is your last chance. . .  Take eleven . . . . You're getting a
visit from two young men very unexpected, and then a very
lovely parcel here coming on a long journey to ye. And money
back and front. Moeny. You're going to be very lucky.
You've put your heart and mind to something and you're going 
to succeed there. But always this marriage turns up here. . .
Lomax: You haven't said marriage before. . . .
Jean: I let you see the ring. There's marriage here. Watch
yourself to see that ye dinna get hooked!
