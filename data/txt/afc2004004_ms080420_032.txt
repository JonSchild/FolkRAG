R-5 CONT.
[*Polly Wells*] Alan: You don't believe in people who sell their religion,
in preaching, and books, and things like that.
[*Caz*] Man 1: No...(unintelligible)..I don't believe in any
preachers. I don't know if they're preaching the right
thing or not, I couldn't tell you. I don't think they
are.
Interviewer: What do you think about that?
[*Ray*] Man 2: Well, I'll have to agree. Like I said I don't believe
in organized religion. The preachers, they're all different.
If all of 'em woulda come up with a doctrine or the same
thing--they're all getting it out of the same book. But
they all read the same book and come up with something
different. So I can't go along with that. I don't believe
in the preachers, I'm going to have to level with you, I
absolutely do not believe in a preacher.
AL: Well one thing they try to do is regulate your sex.
They try to regulate how you are with the opposite sex.
And I've always felt that that didn't have anything to
do with religion at all, that's a man's personal life.
[*Ray*] Man 2: They ain't got nothin' to do with my sex, and they
never will have. I'm a pretty good horse (?) when it comes
to that.
AL: A pretty good what?
[*Ray*] Man 2: A pretty good horse (?), and I...no preacher fumblin'
around me..and nobody else. (Laughter)
I: Well, I believe in God.
Man?: Oh.
Man 2: Oh I believe in a God. A man that don't believe in God
is foolish.
Musical interlude. (Banjo). (Voices unintelligible).
I: I think we've got a great scene, and uh..
Man ?: Do ya wanna sing one..?
I: Well...
Man 2: Do, do something..I wanta get my wife and young ones
one little shelf (?), could you do that?
Man?: Oh sure.
