                                       20 Composers Employed
        For the folk music classes Columbia has also commissioned 20 American composers to write original orchestral works based on folk themes, and has worked out its programs on a decade's experience in examining every fact of music for child-study.
       In the spring of 1930, when "Columbia's American School of the Air" was founded, young CBS listeners were introduced to the music of their own land in three outstanding programs: "Historic Panorama of American Music," "American Folk-Music" and "A Musical Trail Across the United States." Another part of the opening season's schedule, "Men Who Made America," contained additional music showing the type that was written and performed in each period of the country's history from the time of Columbus. Similar parallels were also drawn allied subjects such as art.
                                          Divided Into Grades
         In the ensuing 1930-31 season music was divided into grades for primary, intermediate and upper class students, as well as for high school pupils and even adults. Primary grades were encouraged to use "My Radio Picture Book," distributed by CBS, which they could read and color. 
          The intermediate grade was instructed in various types of music, its forms and instruments. A general history of music from medieval times was traced for advanced listeners, American music naturally being prominently included.
          Succeeding years' schedules brought music closer together with geography, history and similar subjects. Dorothy Gordon, noted folksong interpreter, joined the series to lead "Radio Journeys to Music Land" that later grew into an approximation of 'round-the-world trips in music. Some of the melodies of the United States presented by her have recurred in Lomax's present series, such as 'A Frog He Went a Courtin'." Miss Gordon's highly popular programs continued for several seasons.
