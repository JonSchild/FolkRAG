Horrors of War 

My sister obtained some information
from a friend who has recently returned 
from the war zone of Guadalcanal. 
Because of the effects of the atmosphere
every three months or so 
new reinforcements are required, not
due to the fact that there were wounded
and dead there, but because that was
generally the limit of time some boys
could last because of the mental strain

On the ship board while the marines
were returning home to the United 
States there were nearly twenty men
who were in straight jackets, many
others were nervous wrecks.  Even this
particular boy has changed into a
very restless and extremely nervous
man.  All the horrors of war are not
fully realized by us the people, on
the home front.
