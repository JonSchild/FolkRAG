FOR RELEASE
SUNDAY, APRIL 6, 1941.

     Maryland's public health facilities around military and
industrial plants, bolstered by aid from the United States Public
Health Service, will become a field training area for the Federal
Service's now personnel, Surgeon General Thomas Parran announced 
today.
     Although Maryland alone will provide the field training,
numerous other States which have defense areas, are to receive
public health reinforcements in the forms of physicians, engineers,
nurses, laboratory technicians and use of equipment from the Federal
health service. These provisions are part of an augmented public
health program authorized by Congress in connection with national
defense.
    Areas in Maryland where the State public health service is
to be Federally reinforced are the counties of Baltimore, Ann
Arundel, Harford, Prince Georges, and Howard and Baltimore City. The
military and defense activities in those areas include the Aberdeen
Proving Ground, Edgewood Arsenal, Glenn Martin Airplane Factory,
Bethlehem Steel Shipbuilding Plant, Sparrows Point, Fort Meade an
the clinics for venereal disease treatment in Baltimore and 
metropolitan Washington.
