There's a few right here in this country could do
things would harm you in New York City.

Who you talkin 'bout?

You know who I'm talkin about. I'm talking about 
Uncle Tom, that's who.

Uncle Tom can do it, yes he can. If he want, he can do 
it.
 
You can go to Uncle Tome crawlin on your knees and you
say, "I can't walk, Uncle Tom."  He tell you to walk and, if the 
Lord intend for you to [walk] get up any more, you get up and go
walking to him.

That's what you'll do. 

What kind of a looking man is he?

He's a settled man--light brown skin man and settled.

Farmer?

He's got his own place-- he ain't a farmer.
He don't farm for nobody, Uncle Tom don't. He don't 
have to work. Other folks works, see.

Speakin' 'bout--he's got his own place; he's just a
manager on his own place--he don't do nothin.
 
And everybody goes to him?

Everybody. Colored and White, too. 

My wife went to him, that's how I know. She 
was real sick and she went to some conjurer cross over in
Arkansas and he had her to where she couldn't walk...

Couldn't raise her hand up over her head, I seed her. Po
pitiful little thing.

See, she had thought it was a misery in her side, so 
she didn't go to Uncle Tome for two or three weeks and that
