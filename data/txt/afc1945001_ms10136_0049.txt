Negro  [*59*]
1  My friends "watch Churchill"
He might hand us a dirty pill.
2  Many think Hitler's bad -
a big bad man;
But let me ask our Negro troops
of Doughboys at Bataan.
3  May these aquaintances be forgive -
these days of fear and woe,
when Hitler and Tojo
are buried deep and low.
4  Here's to the Colonel lad
who fights, braves, and die
who knows the things for which he fights
Tomorrow makes his children cry.
5  He changed his name from "Shickledriver"
and now men call him Hitler -
But we have found his recent might
has labled him "herr funny fiddler".
