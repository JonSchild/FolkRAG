Dear Sir: 

                I am engaged on serious research along the lines of folk song ( the lyrics; not so much the music. ) and ballads which were extant in New England (particularly N.H.) in the early period of the colonization and the Revolutionary period. I am particularly involved in the undertaking also of tracing these which came from the British Isles, with the colonists, or late, on the sailing vessels in the great days of brisk trade between the N, England colonists and England.

                 I have found leads which take me into the south, for origin perhaps before they reached here-- which makes it the more interesting, naturally. 

               Can you cite me to sources or give me information from the Archives as to songs which were sung, most likely in this region? I do not find anything so far in your and other collections except the Lord Lovel and the Lord Bateman (Loving Song, so-called some instances,) which I have discovered were sung here. 

                I have however just begun on the search for these, and am not sure how one goes about tracing a fragment of song which some old grand mother, sings or repeats to me, although from her background I am pretty sure it came from England, Wale or Ireland, as the case may be. 

                   Naturally I have used the Ganger Index, and other usual library indices, and the usual collections of folk songs. It appears that there has been more done in the west than in "culcha'd New England."   Being a Pouthernerby birth and a westerner (New Mexico) by adoption, I may be permitted this poke in the rock-ribbed intellectual anatomy of this country. I think in your work of collecting in the western and cowboy fokesongs and ballads, you knew Alice Cortin Henderson, a very good friend of mine. She was very much interested in western folksongs at that time; but I was then interested more, in the Spanish heritage (through the late Charles Lummis.) 

Any pointers which you may give me or directions as to where to actually begin to dig, will be deeply appreciated. 

Very sincerely yours, 
Luna Sunclair
