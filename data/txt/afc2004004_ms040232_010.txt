Both these songs are recorded in Simply -
gypsies written by me. If you are ever in
this neighborhood I shall be glad to give 
you the song as I heard Gengtie sing
it - I am sorry to be unable to help you
but I may have encouraged you [*ick]
deeper and you may find plenty of real
folk songs and excellence & that of all the
great men who have written folk songs and 
literature all across the ages. The mere recording
Their efforts in print should not
deprive them of their right to be folklorists.
Looking forward to the pleasure of seeing
you sometime.  Believe me

Yours very sincerely
McCormick

Why are there so many folklorists on the 
western isles - because there have been 
few printing presses available there to 
record their songs to and make them no 
longer folk lorists; at any rate it could seem 
as if Galloway folklore songs thie buried in the mouth of the printing press.
