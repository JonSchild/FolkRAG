of Payton, instigator of a riot there (Texas). Payton was also
a detective. I heard Payton killed a solider to start the riot.
I don't know if that is true. Payton ordered these guys to leave
town because they wouldn't work. I made out some papers and turned
my supposed-to-be tailor shop over to them. I had paid $25 for the 
whole thing, it was at San Felipe and Henie. It was underneath
Tejan's and Witherspoon's Club. (Tejan was manager of the colored 
baseball club.) When Payton told them to get out of town they
said they was in business. Payton started to beat them up. So
finally they told him all the arrangements I had made to protect
them. Payton came to the tailor shop and told me I would have to
close the business. So I closed it. (This all happened after I 
went to San Antonio.) I had a girl in all the towns I went and
they all thought I was going to marry them.  The people in Texas
had some kind of fear if you said you came from New Orleans.

Was in San Antonio. Friend of mine, Nick Brusso, encouraged me to
go to California because no one could play anything there. In San
Antonio, nobody could play anything there except one girl who was
a strictly show player.  I went to California. In California, I
made Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Diego. Nick wanted me to go
to California so he could get in with the sporting women.  There
were very few colored people around. Liked it pretty well but I
wasn't well acquainted.  Didn't play very much. Played pool occasionally.
Played piano but I didn't work because there wasn't
much to work for--just parties and such. Went to Oxnard, sixty
miles from Los Angeles. Good town with a lot of fast stepping
women. Went back through Memphis, Texas, Oklahoma.  Nobody in
California to play the blues.

1907--Went to Chicago on a train excursion. Was in Chicago before
I was in California.  Would play on the excursions. Some of the 
guys didn't want to get up and let us play. They was jealous.
Bob [Cowell] Caldwell went up with [us] Tony J. the first time he went to Chicago.

In [(Sam Davis')] Bad Sam's place, a guy tried to knife me. Had made friends
with Coon Cant George. He took a liking to me.  I started playing
the piano.  There behind me was a guy coming to me with a knife.
His girl had looked at me and liked me.  I pulled the beer bottle 
from the top of the piano and said: "Come on with your knife; I
ain't scared of you." George carried a "45" at this time with a 
ring in the handle. He walked in with a pistol in his hand. This
guy seen the gun and got out of the way.  Then I was strong from
then on and nobody bothered me.

Buster Brown and Alto Lane came in then. (In Memphis you shoot
dice in a leather horn with a string [pulled] across the top.) You was
limited to three licks as far as you could shoot. They asked me
for money. At this time, I was getting money from Blanche, a
sporting woman. They had no place to stay--used to go down to
the river to wash their feet.  Told them to do their gambling with
their loaded dice on Frazier Davis' watch and not on Sam's.
