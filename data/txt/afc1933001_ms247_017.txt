Dear Alan:  Your Secretary, I 
think, sent me the enclosed letter 
by mistake, together with a batch 
of stuff I had forwarded to 
you, thinking you might find 
some interest in reading what 
some of my correspondents are 
saying to me.  Whenever I make 
blunders with you I hope you 
will continue to be generous and 
say to yourself, "That's just like 
father.  Whatever he is or is not
I know he's honest in his 
wrong thinking"  At any rate I 
love you and don't want to get 
in your way.  Affectionately always,
Father.
