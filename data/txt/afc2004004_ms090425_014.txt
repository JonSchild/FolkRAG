My name is Carolyn Joiner, member of the Mt.
Hararat [Ararat?] Baptist church - I've served [here?] right
around 25 years.  I want to sing a song I heard
my grandmother sing long years ago.  How old the
song is I really can't tell, but when I remember
anything I remember my g-mother sing this song.
