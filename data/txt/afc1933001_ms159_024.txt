Miss Harriet G. Brown
Brookfield, Mass.

Dear Miss Brown:

May I suggest that you look for material in the
following books:

1. English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians,
Cecil Sharpe, London, 1932.

2. A Song Catcher in the Southern Mountains, Dorothy
Scarborough, Col. Uni. Press, 1937.

3. Ballad Making in the Kentucky Mountains, Jean Thomas,
1939.

4. Folk-Songs Du Midi Des Estats-Unis, Josiah Combs, Paris,
1925.

5. Folk Songs of the South, J.H. Cox, Harvard Press, 1929.

6. Folk Songs of the Southern Highlands, Mellinger, Henry Augustin,
New York, 1937.

7. Folk Hymns of America, A.M. Buchanan, New York, 1938.

8. White Spirituals of the South Uplands, G.P. Jackson,
N.C., 1933.

9. Spiritual Folk Songs of Early America, G.P. Jackson,
N.Y. 1937.

In these books and in others mentioned in their bibliographies,
you'll find a wealth of fresh and relatively little
known Appalachian Folk Song material of all types. By careful
selection, a couple of fine chapters can be added to your
book.

I'd very much like to see the work when it's published.

Sincerely yours,
