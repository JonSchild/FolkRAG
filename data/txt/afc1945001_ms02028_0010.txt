No. 5.  A local labor union official - Mr. Wayne Knight, 1704 Lay St., Des Moines, Ia
            Mr. Knight was recommended both by the State C.I.O. office and by a
prominent Des Moines labor attorney as especially intelligent and currently leading
in the C.I.O. organization move at the Des Moines Ordnance Plant, and likely to be
the head of the union there when it is organized. Mr. Knight has insisted that
most of the rumors he hears pertain to the fight for jurisdiction between unions
and that he would be unable to indicate any material which might be adverse to his
union.
            He is employed on changing shifts and I find it difficult to get in contact
with him, but hope to be able to send any material he might accumulate later this
afternoon or tomorrow. Mr. Knight would be a favorable source of information if he
could be trained to understand the purpose of the office in securing the material.
He was a little shy because the day before I talked with him, the Sunday paper had
carried the OWI release on rumors.
