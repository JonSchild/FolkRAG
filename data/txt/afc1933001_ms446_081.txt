66 

The cup is most bitter, but cannot pass by, 
Thy sins, like a mountain, are laid upon me, 
And all this deep anguish, I suffer for thee. 

I heard with deep sorrow, the tale of his woe,
While tears, like a fountain of waters did flow-- 
The cause of his sorrows, to hear him repeat, 
Affected my heart, and I fell at his feet. 

Trembled with horror, and loudly did cry,
Lord !  save a poor sinner, O !  save, or I die ! 
He smiled when he saw me, and said to me, Live,
Thy sins, which are many, I freely forgive. 

How sweet were the moments He bid me rejoice ; 
His smiles, O !  how pleasant, how cheering His 
voice ! 
I flew from the garden, to spread it abroad,
I shouted salvation, and glory to God ! 

I am now on my journey to mansions above, 
My soul's full of glory, of light, peace and love ; 
I think of the garden, the prayer, and the tears,
Of that loving stranger, who banished my fears. 

The day of bright glory is rolling around, 
When Gabriel descending, the trumpet shall sound ; 
My soul then in raptures of glory shall rise, 
To gaze on the stranger with unclouded eyes. 

No. 66 

Alas !  and did my Savior bleed, 
And did my sovereign die ; 
Would he devote that sacred head 
For such a worm as I ! 

Was it for crimes that I have done, 
He groaned upon the tree?
