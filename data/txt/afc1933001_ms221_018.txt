liked it.

I, as you know, am
a very poor proofreader. 
I did go over all
the copy again. Macmillan
will read i, remember, before
the printer gets it. 

I hated to put this
job on you, but I saw
no way to avoid it, especially
since you wanted in.
I feel now almost relieved
of any responsibility
through you and Ruth.

Forest Hill continues
beautiful. lovingly,
Father
