Noo the stane had great pow'rs that could dae
such a thing,
And withoot it, it seemed, we'd be wantin a king,
So he called in the polis and gave this decree --
"Go an hunt oot the stane and return it tae me"
With a etc.

So the polis went beetlin up tae the North.
They huntit the Clyde and they huntit the Forth
But the wild folk up yonder jist kiddit them a'
Fur they didnae believe it was magic at a'.
With a etc.

Noo the Provost o Glesca, Sir Victor by name
Was awfy pit oot whan he heard o the Stane,
So he offered the statues that staun in the square
That the high churches' masons might mak a few mair.
With a etc.

When the Dean o Westminster wi this was acquaint
He sent fur Sir Victor and made him a saint,
"Noo it's nae use you sending your statues doon here"
Said the Dean "Bbut you'ge gied me a right good idea."
With a etc.

So he quarried a stane o the very same stuff
An he dressed it a' up till it looked like enough
Then he sent for the press and announced that the stane
Had been found and returned to Westminster again.
With a etc,

When the rievers found oot what Westminster had done,
They went aboot diggin up stanes by the ton,
And fur each wan they feenished they entered the claim
That this was the true and original stane.
With a etc,
