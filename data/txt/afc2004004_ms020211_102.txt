Dear John,

There's a small tour cooking for the group with
the first concert around April 9 in New York
where we will also have Ed Young and that good
guitar-picker from Mississippi to join you.  At
that time we will try to build the group into a
traveling troup.

Tell Bessie she has a teaching job in California
next fall about which I will get in touch with her
soon.

Much love to all,
