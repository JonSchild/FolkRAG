Subject: Discussions Of The General Public,
RE: Rumors
While listening in on a conversation, by a group of men in
the vicinity of 3rd. and Fort St. I heard them discussings a subject
pertaining to the ARMED FORCES of today. This subject involves a
situation which arose during WORLD WAR #1. These men stated, that the
soldiers of today are very much interested in preventing this condition
from arising again.

[*Patrolman B.*]
[*1*] As I was patrolling my beat, a young man well dressed about
29yrs. of age, 5ft. 9in. tall and weighing about 160lbs. stopped me and
asked me for information regarding a street and number. While in conversation
with this man, he expressed that [in his] [*the*] opinion people were
not accepting the war serious enough. The press in his opinion was not
endesvoring to print the true facts about [the] war production, and also
stating he had heard, of a large Aircraft factory which was suppose to 
have airplanes on production, but has not completed one that will pass
government specification.
