Dear Alan:

Under the terms of an agreement dated January 1, 1966, Ludlow
Music, Inc. acquired the following selections adapted and
edited by Bessie Jones and Alan Lomax:

JOHNNY CUCKOO
SOMETIMES (Way Down Yonder)
GO TO SLEEPY LITTLE BABY
HAMBONE

We were recently advised that Bessie Jones had signed an
agreement with Progressive Music in 1930 for the above four
selections. Progressive Music was eventually taken over by 
Hill & Range Songs, Inc. These four songs are claimed by Hill
& Range Songs, Inc. under the terms of the 1960 agreement.
Your name does not appear as the collector and editor of additional
new material on the original Progressive Music agreement.

We are wondering whether you are aware of this earlier contract
and whether Ludlow Music, Inc. must now cede its rights to Hill & Range Songs, Inc.

Would appreciate your thoughts in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Jay Mark
