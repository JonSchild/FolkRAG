BJ TAPE 40, p. 17

ride 'em; jus' ride 'em.  They can't ride 'em nowhere but, but
in the lots.  Ya hear 'em runnin' all night, jus' runnin'.  "Ta-boggedy,
boogedy, boogedy," jus' goin'.  Because they couldn't stop
them ol' hag folks.  They couldn't --
     But they had to ride something.  Because they had turnt
theyself in that way.  An' 'f dey didn' ride peoples, they had to
ride hosses, ya see. Or mules, or sumpthin' of that type.  An' so
that's what they would do, they [said] say.
     So this man told me that, he said nobody that wanted to jus'
be that way.  They went for sumpthin' else an' they come out the
wrong way.
[*(HOW TO BECOME ONE)*]
     They would take a black cat, that slick-black cat, ya know.
An' ah, kill 'im.  Ah . . .however, they would ah do it like we do a
crab now.  They'd put 'im in hot water alive, ya know, boilin'
water.  Alive.  An' ah, but they had to go to a certain place ta
do this.  Some say they do it, ah, under two heels (hills), in
between two heels at a runnin' brook.  You know, a runnin' stream
a water, an' ah, that's goin' one way, you know.
TL: 
BJ:  Yeah.  An' then they boi-, ah, throw that in there, throw that
cat in therre, an' they say, at that time, say darkness would
come over ya.  [An'] Jus' like midnight.  An' all kindsa creatures would
come before ya.  You --That's what they say would happen.  An' ah,
say, then you, you -- But you got to stan' all that.
     An' then, after this cat boils, boils, boils into pieces,
boiled up all the meat off [its] his bones.  If you taken then, the bones 
out of it, and ah, put it in a runnin' stream, an' say that three
bones will come back up the stream, instead of jus' one.  An' you
got to choose one of those bones for what ya wanna be.  Ya see?
