Dear Bess:
I shall be glad to send you a copy of "What
Wondrous Love is This" as soon as the purchase order
is received. I am sending an estimate to OEM today.
A second order forwarded by OEM puzzles me and I am
returning it for further information. This is an order
for 3 Slovene songs and 5 others, none of which I
recognize. 
I am sorry I did not get a chance to see you in
New York as I was working under great pressure and against
time.
With best wishes,
Faithfully,

B. A. Botkin
