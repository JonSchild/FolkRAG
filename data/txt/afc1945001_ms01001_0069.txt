number. On the 12th of July, almost a month after the sinking, he
name of the Provincetown was released along with an account of the work
of Civilian Defense units. Since there were many witnesseses to the
bringing in of survivors and dead, stories soon spread along the grapevine.
The following are a few of the more fantastic versions reported
to us:

1. 15,000 troops lost off Provincetown.
2. The entire Cape under martial law and great numbers of
bodies of soldiers washing ashore.
3. The bodies of 40, 120, 200 nurses washed ashore.
4. All hospitals and hotels in Provincetown filled

loss of 15,000 troops.
2. The canal was filled with the bodies of soldiers and
nurses from the sinking.
3. The entire Cape was under martial law, and the canal
blocked off from the public.
4. The sinking in the Canal was done by a German sub.

the scope of the horizon of the individual is a first factor. Then there
must be some form of precipitating incident or event. This may be a
story, a little bit of authoritative information, some occurrence incompletely

entirely prepared. We may find, for example, that the military movements
in Madagascar may have led people to try to understand why such activity
