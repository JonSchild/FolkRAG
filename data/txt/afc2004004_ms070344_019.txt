with 3 bars & the grill for their
steaks right out in the dining
room - gravy soups, boiled vegetables,
a perennial air of well-being.  This
week I was so depressed by a 
feeling of inferiority to Seamus that
I almost left - even now writing it
a week later I have to fight it 
back.  A long evening of listening 
to anecdotes & not being able to
produce one, feeling that I
know absolutely none - while
Dancher & Ennis delighted Robin -
I think I turned pale; at least
everyone was quite nervous.

Wonderful story about a barber
who lathered his own face, lathered
the customer, then  squatting down
with his soapy mug at a level
 with his customers, said:  And
I wonder which one of us should
live & which one should go
