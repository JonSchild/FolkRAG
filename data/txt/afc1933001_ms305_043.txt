with the tall plumes on their heads and looked 
at their dainty feet pick nicely over the cobblestones. 
     That night I saw the show twice at the movies, 
and when I got out it was cold and dark. I was 
running with the wind and almost home when I 
slowed down by Liebmann's Kosher meat market 
because there was a long shiny black wagon outside 
the market. The lights in the store were out, 
and the window next to the store had the shade 
pulled down. I went by the window and peeked 
in. Tall mister Liebmann, with his long gray 
beard and skull-cap, was holding his hands behind 
him and there were people standing near him, 
weeping. In front of me was a bed. Right under 
the sill was missus Liebmann's head. She was 
very still. I ran home saying, "Jesus, Jesus, 
Jesus," and blinking my eyes and nodding my 
head every time I said Jesus. 
     Papa called me over as soon as I opened the 
door. He was sitting on the couch with his shoes 
off, smoking his corn-cob, strumming his guitar, 
playing Nothing Can Be Finer Than To Be In 
Carolina, and mama was sewing at the table. 
     "Wild Indian," he said, "what have you done 
now - answer me...!" 
     I told what I saw in Liebmann's window. 
Papa's face winced. He slowly stopped strumming 
the guitar, and kept sucking at his pipe even 
though it had gone out. 
     In the middle of the night I awoke. Papa and 
mama were talking in bed. The kids were awake 
too and squirming under the covers to keep from 
getting cold. 
     "Did you awaken me just to tell me that?" said 
papa. 
     "But Geremio," answered mama, "I am not 
imagining things." 
     "You are having a fantasy." 
     "No, no, believe me husband, I was cold awake, 
thinking."
     She then said she was gazing at the little high-set 
two-paned window of their bedroom which 
shows out onto the hallway. - The little window 
which in the shadows of night sends into the bedrooms 
the dancing garish figures of the hallway 
gaslight. 
     "My open eyes were upon the fenestrella's gaslit 
lume," said mama, "and there sounded a lucid 
tapping - that came thrice - plainly - plainly - 
plainly-" 
     Papa did not say anything for a long while. 
He got up. Then he went by our bed only with 
his long underwear on and in his bare feet. He 
had my baseball bat in his hands. (Cont. page 24) 

"A remarkable piece of 
fictionizing which no lover 
of romance, adventure or 
epic narrative ought to miss." 
- N. Y. TIMES 
THE 
TORGUTS 
By W. L. RIVER 
"A monumental novel. It has a theme as vast as 
Tolstoy's 'War and Peace,' or Jules Romains's 
'Men of Good Will.' It has all the intensity and 
all the dramatic and narrative impetuosity of 'The 
Forty Days of Musa Dagh' and 'Gone With the 
Wind.' . . . But it is much more than a historical 
novel; it is rather a prose epic that moves like 
an avalanche of sound and fury and human desire 
as it tells of love, hope, adventure, patriotism 
and human aspirations amid a Mongol horde 
of half a million souls while they go thundering 
and struggling across 3,000 miles of Siberian 
steppes and Turanian highlands." -Lloyd Eshleman
