Dear Mr. White:
 
At the suggestion of Messrs. Stanton and 
Barnhart, both of whom have been in touch with you about 
"Yardstick for Rumors" I write to ask you for a copy of 
your report on this film when you audition it and report 
to Columbia Broadcasting System. Barnhart, who talked to 
you about this over the phone, said you would be willing 
to furnish us a copy of your report if we would ask for 
it in writing. 

Thanking you in advance for your cooperation, 
I am 

Sincerely yours, 

Eugene Katz 
Chief, Special Service Division
