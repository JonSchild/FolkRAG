Dear Mr. Lomax,
I must apologize for having
asked to come and see you last month
and then being unable to find a 
suitable time. I don't know how much
longer you will be staying in England
but perhaps, if your departure is not
imminent, you could spare me an hour
sometime. Arrangements become
complicated for me in the next month
because my final exams are at the
end of May, but I shall be coming
