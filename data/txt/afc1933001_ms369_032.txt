that have been subjected for several centuries to countless 
influences, both individual and social! We do not know,
for instance, any way of determining which of several
versions of a given ballad is the oldest; and there is
room for argument, as we shall see, about the relative 
genuineness of a group of ballad variants.
On account of these and similar considerations 
a history of the English ballad at present is/an impossibility. 
Nevertheless,
there remains
for the student of literary history the grand argument about
poetic origins one of the most stimulating, if not
fertile, discussions in connection with man's study of man. Certain
notions have been developed in the course of this discussion which
merit the attention of anyone interested in literature;
and this paper is intended as a summary and scattering criticism of the positions and conjectures 
of some of the prominent figures of the controversy.
