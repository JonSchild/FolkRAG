mind to you (however twisted or prejudiced
or stupid the aforesaid mind 
may be), and I promise to keep
up the practice.

Ask Bess if she has
any complaint against me
during my visit to her in
January. I expressed a wish
not to meet Leadbelly and I
offer[r]ed a mild protest when
Woody indulged in low gutter
oaths, without excuse or apology,
in talking to her and the C.B.S.
announcer. Otherwise I thought
I behaved with as much decency
as she had a right to expect
of one with my background
and other lamentable limitations.
But if Bess thinks differently, I
withdraw my defense and plead
guilty.

As for you I think it
is fine that you are trying
to help her. And I am open to you
