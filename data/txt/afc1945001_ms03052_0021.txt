It is rumored that Henry J. Kaiser, shipbuilder, will replace Mr. Donald M. Nelson as head of the War Production Board. Mr. Kaiser will replace Mr. Nelson because he has the ability to see in the future, to get things donewhen they seem impossible and is in general better suited for the job of getting our production up. The reason he will replace Mr. Nelson, is that, while Mr. Nelson is a very competent [and] he lacks the foresight and ability to get things done that Mr. Kaiser has.
