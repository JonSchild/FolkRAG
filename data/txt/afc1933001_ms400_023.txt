Adventures of a Ballad-Hunter

seven from the singing of Negro convicts in southern penitentiaries.

We visited our singers where they felt at home and comfortable,
where their singing was unrestrained and natural. In many states the
convicts we visited work on large cotton, corn and cane plantations,
where they are separated into companies of three or four hundred men,
living in groups of well kept houses that are situated in different
parts of plantations. Both in Mississippi and in Louisiana the
farms comprise about 25,000 acres each, with about a dozen headquarters.
The black convicts do not work or eat or sleep in the same buildings as
do the white prisoners. They are kept in entirely separate units, they
are guarded by Negro trusties; they even work in separate fields. Thus
a long-time Negro convict spends many years with practically no chance
of hearing a white man speak or sing. Such men slough off the white
idiom they may once have employed in their speech and revert more and
more to the idiom of the Negro common people.

In my judgment, the songs and ballads we found under the conditions
indicated, are practically pure Negro creations, both in words and
music. Either that, or the words have become so encrusted with Negro
accretions that trace of white influence is completely obscured. Long-term
convicts, I found, naturally revert to the songs they sang before
coming to the penitentiary. Thus the old songs are kept alive and growing
as they are passed along to successive generations of convicts. Sometimes
an indulgent prison management allows a talented Negro prisoner to
keep his own guitar for the entertainment of fellow prisoners, to be used
