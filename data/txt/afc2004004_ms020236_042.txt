[*Big neck detective*]

home with that guy.  An' that guy, he'd sit and talk with us.  
An' he had come there backwards and forth at home.  He had stayed there 
almos' a week.    A little better than a week; he stayed there 
around seven days, or eight.  An' so then they say, "Ho, I see where 
she had a guy, that's the Big Neck.   The Big Neck.   They 
call him that 'cause he was fat.   He had a big roll of mutton 
meat at the back of his neck with that cap [fittin']fitted on it, you know!  
Ha!   An' I didn' know whose chile he was.   An' so he stayed on 
there; he's a man, a colored man.    But he's stout an' heavy.  
Looked like he ought been a preacher or sumpin' but there wa'n' 
nothin' to it, in that line.   But he was so nice to me an' Miss 
Alice, y'know.   An' that was the on'iest somebody's house he 
would [go] come around.   An' that -- jus' from that.
TL:            Is that right?
BJ:            The on'y.  one.  Now he got him a job at the mill.   You
see.   An' he worked at the mill.  He [wa' n'] worked at the mill 
until -- until on a Monday night, one Monday night -- it's time 
for him to go.   Nobody know who he was.   When he left there he 
carried three white men an' two colored.   He was a detective! 
Nobody knowed it.  He was colored, too.
TL:            He carried them?  
BJ:            He carried them.  He was a detective; he [arrested them?] was ready for them.  
The train rolled in there an' stopped.   Nobody know why it was 
stopped.   Said he was gonna let everybody know everything, ya see?  
Jus' (where they was at?)            An' they rolled in there; 
them big men was on that thing, inside.   He had done arrested them.  Had 'is 
['em] handcuff[ed]; had 'is big badge.  I ain' seen that.  He hadn' 
said, "I 'restin. . ."          Then they know that I didn' 
know 'im!   I didn' know who he was.   You see.   An' he was a 
detective.    Boy that was sumpin'.   I'm tellin you' that was 
some 'musement there.
                An so, I wa'n' glad he caught the men or nothin' like 
that, but I was glad that they know that I didn' know 'im -- They'd a 
kep' on sayin', "Oh yeah. . .He done come. . .That mus' be her husband.
. . .Oh, she know he was comin'. "   An' I didn' know that man's name.  
He, he!   Who he was, but. . .
TL:            What did Alice teach you to do, Bessie, so people don't 
know who you're         ?
