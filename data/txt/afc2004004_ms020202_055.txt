Dear Alan & Jonia
It seam as if you all dont
have time to write no one
but I wont to borrow a few
moment of you time I recived
a letter from Roy Gust of
London, and he said
to me in his letter that he
would be arranging a 3
week visit for me to come
to Britain and that I would
have to bring a Guitar player
with me!  And I wont to
know what my regular fee
would be and I dont know
what to tell him because I
dont wont to mess things up.
And I would have to let him
know right away.  so please write
and tell me what I should
charge.  I would be comming to
New York.  Around the 20th of July.
