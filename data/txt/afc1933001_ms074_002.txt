Dear Mr. Waters:
Mr. Real sent me no white
slip waiving Express charges, and
every sign of a Government frank
on the cases was thoroughly scratched
out. I hold an express receipt 
for $12 27 which I paid in Dallas 
to get the machine out for immediate
use.

Write Real to get a duplicate
slip and send it direct to me.
I'll collect here and save 
you any further trouble.

Thank you for your kind
letter. Give my love to Mrs. Waters.

Your friend, John A. Lomax
