Fold-Song for the Public

John Avery and Allen Lomax, Texas father and 
son, painstakingly gathering on records the harmony 
that has gone into American folk-singing, are responsible 
for fully [90?] per cent of the material stored in the 
Library of Congress for which the Carnegie Corporation 
has just provided a $41,500 gift in reproducing
equipment.  As a result, Americans with an interest 
in indigenous music will be able to secure at 
small cost a priceless library of unusual song.

What the Lomaxes did under government grant 
should have been done long ago.  For it stands to reason 
that with each passing generation, a little goes 
out of the homely lore that is folk-singing.  Something 
new is added.  Balladry and snatch of song preserved 
today doubtless vary from the actuality of a 
hundred years ago.  Some things we have lost beyond 
recall.

Wizardry in modern reproductive mechanics furnishes 
the modus operandi for retaining the speech, 
the song, the diction o our own time.  We are fortunate 
in that and it is good news that the work of 
the Lomaxes will be amplified as part of the planning 
that accrues from the Carnegie gift.

All this is very far from unimportant, thought it 
may seem so to the hurrying mortal who is content to 
leave yesterday buried and to live in today, with 
neither care nor thought that our own record should 
be preserved for the future.  To be sure, we seem to 
have learned all too little from the past.  We have 
accepted what it has contributed in basic formula to 
science and invention, learned nothing from it of ways 
to avoid bitterness and strife and slaughter.  There 
is hope in song that momentarily at least makes the 
world akin.

The Lomax work, the Library of Congress collection 
it has provided, now the means for its widespread 
uses, will bring us closer to the type of communal 
singing that has gathered the world about its 
humble minstrels.
