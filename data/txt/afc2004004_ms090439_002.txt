Storm in Tupelo...
Dictated by Turner Junior Johnson
August 15, 1942, en route from
Coahoma to Panola County. The tune
was a variant of the Hallelu air.

The wind dashedat the building
And the shack commenced reeling and rocking
Wasn't that a storm at Tupelo,
Wasn't that a storm, wasn't that a storm.

Well, the lightning was playing upon your window blind
And the thunder began to roar and the mother was standing with
folded arms,
Wasn't that a storm at Tupelo...

Well, we were children who were drifting in the trenches of the storm
And they were drifting by the-------
And the lightning began to flash
And the thunder[x] began to roll
Wasn't that a storm at Tupelo....

It was late one Friday evening
Just about eight o'clock
When the storm begin to rise
And the wind begin to blow
Wasn't that a storm that rech in Tupelo...

And the people was screaming and cryin
Lookin at the storm
Then mother and her child
They was standin with folded arms
And the tears was rollin down,
Wasn't that a storm at Tupelo...

Well mother andher child
Who were standin with folded arms
Well lookin at the cloud
Well the cloud is wavin and dark

Well father and his mother
Who were standin with folded arms
And mother said to her child
We were all bout to git destroyed
If I could hear her pray how glad I would be...

God, but Was a God somewhere----

When I heard of it , it just come in my mind to make
a record of it. I was layin there that night with the wind
blowin and the rain on the windowpane and it just came in
