Anecdote

In a letter from a soldier the following 
statements were written. "I am confined 
to bed with German measles. I
really do need the rest, all this routine
has me all run down. The only thing 
that worries me is the boys in my 
company. Each morning a few of them 
stand below my window and yell "Oh
Sarge, don't let them Germans get you."
I wouldn't mind anything if the dumbest 
Private in camp wouldn't come
and sit by my bed telling me how to 
take care of them. Oh, well, I don't
care, I have two pretty nurses.
