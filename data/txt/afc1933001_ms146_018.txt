Dear Mr. Spivacke:

I appreciate your letter of June 12.

I would like to come to Washington when you are there; therefore,
would it be convenient if I were to visit you some time
between June 27 and 30?       It is my plan to spend the afternoon
of one day and all of the next in Washington; therefore, 
if you can find two consecutive days within these dates
I shall appreciate your letting me know as soon as possible.

I hope that I shall be in Camden next week when Mr. Alan Lomax
visits our offices as I would very much like to meet him.

Very truly yours, 
R. P. Wetherald
