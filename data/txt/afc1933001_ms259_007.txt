other bank or party is only provisional and
unitil the proceeds thereof, in money, are 
actually received by this bank or items found
good at the close of business of the day on
which they are deposited such items may be 
charged back to the depositor's account 
regardless of whether or not the item itself
can be returned; that said Bank may decline
payment of any check drawn on such 
deposits until the items of this deposit, though
credited, are actually paid in money; that 
any failure to enforce these rights by the 
bank shall not be construed a waiver thereof;
that items received for deposit or collection 
are so received at depositor's risk, may be 
transmitted in the usual manner for 
collection, either to the bank or person on which
they are drawn, or to such bank or persons
 as said bank shall deem reliable; that all
such direct or indirect collecting agencies
shall be deemed agents of the depositor;
that for the negligence, actions, omissions,
or failure of such collecting agents, or for 
loss of item in transit, or any cause, no
 liability shall attach to the said bank; that 
said bank or any collecting agent may 
receive payment of all or any such items in 
cash, by check or draft, and shall not nor
shall any collecting agent be liable for the 
dishonor of such checks or drafts or losses 
thereon or for the negligence, default or
failure of another; that items may be 
collected through the Federal Reserve Banks
 in accordance with their rules.
