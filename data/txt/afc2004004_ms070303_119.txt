The manor house at Castlebay. 
trained by Scotish home industries 
takes her webs to S. Uist to 
be waulked.  And Duncan MacDonald's 
daughters sing for her.  It is curious 
that there is no question of payment. 
time yet - the old neighborly communal 
thing persists even when 
the exchange of labor idea and 
the dance have disappeared.
