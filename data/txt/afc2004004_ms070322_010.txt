are not my painters, but now at best
I can respond to them & feel instead
of being frozen by a storm of conflicting
emotions.
Just as at Henry V the other night
my ambitions were stirred & I
imagine myself in the glorious company
of hardworkers & creators.
However, to please myself & Robin,
we went to 2 Hollywood films and
saw two unreal lectures, given with
the subtlety of a compressed air drill
on the unreal morality of the untrue
Hollywood version of the American way.
In one V. Mature, a pimp & gambler
& killer, about to be deported, learns
the error of his ways, quotes T. Wolffe
on freedom of opportunity and [is] gets
the girl & his citizenship. In the
other the bucktoothed heroine at at Metro
Goldwyn version of a high school graduation
