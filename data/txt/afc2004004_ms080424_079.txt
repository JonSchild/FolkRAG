Roll 56 Stan and Hattie 2

(Stan) you got to kiss the prettiest girl there was. And the gals didn't
like it too good, because the boys that got it, they shucked awful hard
to get these red (unt) here now. And they put a gallon jug of whiskey
right there in the middle of the pile of corn. And the one who got to
it first got the first drink of moonshine. And the reason they call it
moonshine, they made it in the night. ... They made it out of corn,
like that you know. And they'd grind, take a sprout of corn, that made
their malt. Put it in (unint) as you cooked your meal and started out
put your sugar in it. And then, when the crust got in the top of it, it'd
get about a half inch, grew up on top of your beer, and you broke that up.
And when you got it broke up and comin' in there, then you put it in your 
still. And you put you fire in your still, and you had to stir this,
you couldn't cap it up, it'd start boiling up. If you did, you'd burn it,
scorch it, and that's what they call scorched liquor. And if you got it
too hot it would puke, you know like you (Unint.) you know it'd get it
too hot, and it'd boil out of the pipe too fast, so you had to be awful
careful with it, to make the stuff.

AL: The ladies were worried about the whiskey, weren't they. The men were
drinking too much and getting wild and difficult to hand.e

Hat: Yeah, one time I went to a corn shuckin' and they cooked a big supper.
And I was bashful and I wouldn't go to eat, and they carried me in a chair
and set me beside the table. I jumped up and left the chair settin', went
back to shuckin' corn. And a man found red (unint) and kissed me, and I
drawed back and hit him in the lip and 'bout cut his lip up!

Al: You hit him in the lip and knocked half his lip off?...You must have
been a pretty rough little girl! How old were you then?

Hat: About 17 I guess. No, I didn't even kiss him and...

AL: Was that the first time you'd ever been kissed?
