Mr. Alan Lomax,
Archive of American Folk-Song,
Division of Music,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.
My dear Mr. Lomax:
I was delighted to learn from a recent communication from
Mr. Spivacke that you have been appointed keeper of the Archive
of American Folk-Song in the Library of Congress. My congratulations
to you on this important appointment.
It occurs to me in this connection that something should be
done with regard to safeguarding and making available the collection
of about 170 folk songs of Kentucky which Miss Mary Newcomb, now in
Washington, wrote down under title of "Songs My Mother Sang." Some
of her friends, including myself, have tried to find a publisher for
these tunes and texts but up to date have not succeeded in doing so,
since such a collection has no great commercial possibility unless
the tunes are arranged in some way to make them more practically
useful for the singer or for choral performance.
Miss Newcomb lives at 1501 Monroe Street, N.E., and I am sure
she would be delighted to show you her collection and to discuss it
with you. I have co-operated with her in collecting some other
tunes in the Kentucky mountains and I know her work to be accurate
and authentic in this field.
Sincerely yours,
Marshall Bartholomew
