Helen Creighton Recording Project Extension

Miss Creighton's original project for recording war and wartime
songs in Nova Scotia will expire at the end of December. Since she is about
to exhaust her allotment of 150 blank disks and since she reports that she is 
only just beginning, especially with the Services," I recommend that 75 
additional recordings be purchased.

Respectfully submitted,
