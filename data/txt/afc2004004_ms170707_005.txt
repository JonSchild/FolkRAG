Therefore, pick out the 50 best
bits - things you are certain will make
an impact on most listeners.  And
don't forget interviews!! The bits related
to the program plan outlined
previously.

Remember also that the BBC has
already bought & paid the singers
fees on most of the things I did
in the Lowlands.  We  must use these
things, where practical.  Also Pete
K's Orkney & Shetland stuff is already
paid for.

I'll be in touch with you soon after
Oct. 1.  Thanks for cordial response.
