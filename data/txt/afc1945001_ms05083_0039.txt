'Hill Field (Ogden) is an example of how rotten this thing is 
being handled. All the officers out there are so damned sex-minded 
that they can't keep their mind on their business. Stuff goes out of 
there every day with nobody having an idea whether it's headed for the 
right place or not. I work out there and I know how lousy it is. The 
place is just reeking with filth. Hell, I've had a dozen chances to get 
a better job -- if I wanted to play. I'm talking about majors and 
colonels as well as those damned lieutenants. A girl can get a snap job 
in a minute if she's willing to 'play'." [*Salt Lake City, Utah 21 8-5*]
