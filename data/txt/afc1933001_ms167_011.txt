To Messrs. McGill, Fineshriber and Levine
From Alan Lomax

SUBJECT

Mr. Levine and I did not discuss the possibility of paying my
living expenses for the French Canadian broadcast. As a matter
of fact, when I came home I found that I had spent a lot more
money than is usual on these weekend excursions. A number of
times I entertained the cast, and then prices in Canada are
high for living. I feel that this expense account, therefore,
is justified.
