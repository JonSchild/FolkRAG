Roll 53 Stanley Hicks' house 4

Hat: I guess that be part of it!

AL: Keep the sun and the men out!....This is your sister...?

Stan: Yeah, this is my sister, 'bout 3 or 4 years older than I am...

AL: You're kiddin' me! You're about 100 and she's about 104?

Stan: She's about 104 and I'm about 100! (laughter)

Hat: We're the only two that goes out together anywhere, the rest ain't
natured like we are.

AL: How are you all natured?

Hat: There's 11 of us. We like to get out and see people and stuff. Like 
to sing, and dance, and the rest of them don't like that! I've got one
brother (unint.) in New Y0rk, I took my head and looked out and he said,
"Hattie, Hattie!" And I raised my head up and here come my brother, say
"What's up?" He didn't want me to dance, and you know dancin' ain't a lot
worse than a lot of other things!....

AL: Not nearly as bad!

Hat: But he never believed in any of that stuff. He was a preacher, he did
not want anybody to date you. My grandmother, she was about 74 when she
died, maybe older than that. And she heared music, so she's in a church,
she'd dance. She put her big skirt out and she'd cut down and dance,
wherever she was at if she heard music!

AL: Well you know what Ray is to dancin' (?) in the Hicks' generation. Your
family wasn't against dancing...

Hat: No, but neither one of my grandpas didn't like it. One of them
wouldn't have music in the house.

AL: What kind of music?

Hat: No kind!

AL: Singin', anything?

Hat: Uhuh -- he would church songs, but nothin' else.
