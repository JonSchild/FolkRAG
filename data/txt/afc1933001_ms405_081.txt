Indian chants and songs and the [Spanish] Mexican ballads of the Southwest.
The large collection of wax cylinders of Indian singing
made by different persons for the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington possibly antedates the work of Mr. Lummis, though, so
far as I know, no records of the folk songs of the whites or
Negroes had been made prior to the publication of Cowboy Songs
in 1910. According to the records of the Library of Congress
that book happens to be the first copyrighted collection of
American white folk songs, containing music, printed in the
United States.
The lack of interest in native folk music in 1910
was evidenced by my publishers refusal to print more than
twenty-five tunes of the several hundred I recorded. Fortunately
the wax cylinders are in most cases yet unbroken and
the music may possibly yet be obtained from the somewhat dim, waxen
lines.
The [These] first now antiquated portable recording machines were looked on as
marvelous thirty years ago. The singers, especially in the
far West, were delighted and amazed as the screechy [squeaky] representations
of their voices issued from the recording machine. The
play-back was, [quite] necessary therefore, happens even [necessary] in securing the cooperation of
the timid [and] or indifferent.
