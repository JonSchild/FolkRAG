Fisk, 10.  11.  WILL STARK.

The scale the ram was weighed upon
Covered acres of ground;
When they [l]rolled that ram on there,
It alm st broke him down.

He rambled, etc.

The man that sold the ram
Was in danger of hislife;
He se[n]t down to Saint Louis
For a fo[i]ur-foot butcher knife.

He rambled, didn t he ramble?
Didn't he ramble til the butcher cut him down?

The man that cut down, he burtcheree that ram,
He waded de p in his blood;
The little boy that held his feet
Got drowned inthe flood.

He rambled, didn't he ramble?
Didn't he ramble til the man set him do[?]?

His head lay in the market;
His feet out in the street;
Three girls came walking by,
Said, " Don't them nuts look sweet?"

He rambled, etc.

He rambled on the wate -side;
He rambled on the land.
But when he went to the bu[rtche]tcher pen,
There he met his man.

He rambled, etc.

This ram went up to hismother,
His pail (?) all in a quirl (?)
Said, "Get away from me, you son of a bitch;
I brought you into this world."

(laughter)

ABOUT THE NEW SHERIFF WHO HAS CLOSED DOWN 
GAMBLING AND BARREL HOUSES.

Ever since we got this sheriff,  ou know, he stopped em from dancing 
and he broke up all the barrel houses.  Inother words, I think 
he wants to make a religious town o t of i t.  That is, I guess he promises to do that.  He stopped em from dancing; he broke up the 
gambling houses and all such as that, and we don't have much music - 
only from the radios and th ings like that.
