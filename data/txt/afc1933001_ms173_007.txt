Dear Ed,
   Thanks for keeping us informed about how things
are going at the Library.  I know this complicated
project is a headache for you to handle alone with
all your other jobs, but we'll soon relieve you.  If I
may add a word,
   I think it would be wise to make Randolph an
advance after two weeks work.  When that will fall due
I won't know u till I hear from him.  After the
first advance I think any reasonable schedule will suit
him.  I'll send hisletter along to you when it comes.
   I feel absolutely certain that this present
fieldtrip should be extended for myself, the sound truck
and an engineer until the first week in September.
I should go to the area where the joint project with Fisk
will be carried out for a survey before I attempt
to lead Fisk Sociological field workeres into it.  That
will mean that Jerry (possibly Johnny) and I will backtrack
from the Galax region about the 20th down into the Mississippi
delta area where the Fisk survey will probably be
carried out.  There we will record the music that the
later survey will attempt to find the social basis for
while that musicis being made -- i.e. at the revivals
andparties of laying by time.  That will mean that the
truck may have to be in the field less long on the
October trip with the Fisk students.  The money for that
extension therefore can probably come out of that.
I would greatly appreciate your arranging this for us
in whatever way you think best and meets with the
approval of Mearns and Clapp.
   The trip here is gong very well.  Kindest regards
to all . . .  I leave Atlanta for Mexico on the 11th,
10:45 P.M. and return to Galax on the 18th.  This will
be annual leave for me, please tell Miss
Hazelbush.  How's about my steno?  How's about the
checklist.

Yours,
Alan Lomax
