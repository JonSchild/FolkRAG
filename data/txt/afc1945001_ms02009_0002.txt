The Office of War Information has received many requests for 
cooperation and guidance from groups which are interested in [group] rumor control.
This memorandum is written in response to [these] such requests. It was prepared [*is based on*]
on the basis of an analysis of more than 4,500 rumors and on the basis of 
the experience gained in working with these various projects.

Groups that wish to undertake the considerable responsibility

information activities necessary for rumors control. But there are points
[*in any community.*]
on rumor control which hold true whatever the community. 

Fighting rumors is a complicated, technical task. It raises 
problems in public information, military security, and social psychology.
It involves specific techniques for handling the uneasiness and hostility
which any war necessarily arouses.

DANGERS in ANTI-RUMOR ACTIVITY
Anti-rumor activity which is conducted without an awareness
of the inherent and potential dangers of anti-rumor activity may tend 
to:

a. Circulate the very rumors which are being denied.
b. Circulate more rumors than are effectively denied.
c. Make the community too "rumor-conscious."
d. Creat wide-spread uneasiness, which is fertile soil for
more rumors.
e. Exaggerate the danger of enemy propaganda - creating unnecessary 
fears about the enemy's cleverness or propaganda
success in the United States.
f. Deny only certain kinds of rumors, allowing other rumors
to circulate more freely.
g. Monopolize rumor-fighting by a given group so that that the rumors
denied are simply those which offend the particular sensibilties 
or interests of the group - ignoring those rumors which
the group does not recognize as rumors or as dangerous.

VALUES IN ANTI-RUMOR ACTIVITY
The analysis of rumors is most valuable in revealing those areas 
of information in which public ignorance or confusion lead to rumors.
