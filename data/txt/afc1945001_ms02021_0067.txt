COLORADO  AUGUST 8, 1942

-4-

Rumor heard between two housewives in Denver, on August 4:
"I just got a letter from a friend of mine in California.
I guess things are pretty bad out there because everything is so
dry. From what I can understand they are afraid that the Japs
are going to invade the West Coast and drop incendiary bombs.
People out there are filling their bathtubs and every other kind
of container so they will have plenty of water available if any
fires start. I guess everybody on the West Coast is scared to
death. I am glad I live in Colorado."

Conversation heard between two hospital nurses:
"Some of my friends departed last week from New York for
Australia. I believe there were about 900 nurses and some 300 or
400 doctors on this ship. I talked to one of the girls before she
left Denver. She was very pessimistic about the future. She said
that her ship would be given only a partial convoy and not as large
a convoy as they give troop ships. It seems to me if the country
is so desperately in need of doctors and nurses for the armed forces
they should take more precautions about their safety. If we haven't
got enough ships to convoy these people why don't they wait until
they can build the ships. Personally, I wouldn't be interested in
offering my professional services under such circumstances."
