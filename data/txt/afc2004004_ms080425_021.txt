AL:   And you've been a farmer all your life?  How many
acres do you farm?

Wootten:   Well, I ain't farming at all now. But, when it
was just me and my family at home, we farmed as much as
200 acres, just me and my family.  But, they got scattered
off and I got where I couldn't do much, and I ain't got
much farm left now.  I rent it out; it's just me and
the wife, that's all.

AL:   You children are all gone?

Wootten:   All gone, yeah.  Children are all gone.  But
life's been worth living. Life's been worth living.

AL:   But you have this whole clan that you sing with, they're

Wootten:   That's right, we are. Now wait, don't misunderstand
We're not related, only some of us, you know.  But yet,
me.
