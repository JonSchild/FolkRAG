BJ:  Tha's won'erful.  That thing started mourin' there, I guess
they _____________(? REFERENCE TO FIRE ENGINE IN BACKGROUND
AT END OF SONT??)  But that's alright.
     Now, we gonna have another one that we used to sing --
     I think that's a won'erful song, because, truly, the sun will never
go down, you know, don't need no lights in Heaven.  An' they ain't
no sun down in the ____, see?  My Lord, Jesus will light up the
whole thing!  So hit jus' sumpin' to think about, you know.  I alway --
I see into that bein' true, hah, ya know that?  An' if ya
promise ya meet 'im there, that's a, that's a won'erful thing to
do, to promises that you will meet 'im over there, where the sun
will never go down.
[*RE: "ANYHOW"*]
     An' now we had another old one that we always
loved to sing.  'Cause this is one that I ah, ah, is 'way back,
'way back, when I was small?, too.  An' I also thought to myself
how they gonna do it, but they did it.  An' they are gonna do it,
ya know?  But I used to sing it.  'Cause this word in this song
say, "anyhow."  An', an' ah, it is true that ah you can't do it jus'
anyhow, but in, in, in a way you can.  But you -- In a way, you
can't, you see?  So after I seen into how, ah, I got to do it
anyhow, then I see the peoples was not lyin'.  But I thought that
they was jus' sayin' they jus' goin' there anyhow, regardless of
what God do, but jus' goin' to Heaven jus' anyhow.  Ya see what I
mean!  A-huh!  An' so, but I see now how ya can do it anyhow is
suffer whatsoever come.  An' jus' go on ahead up to Heaven.  Jus'
pass up things an' go on anyhow.  But I didn't see it that way
then, ya see!  I thought that they jus' meant that they jus' gonna
do it jus' anyhow. . .'cause. . .a-ha, ha. . .Whether He wants to or not!
Ha, ha, so, ha, ha, ha, but I see into it now.  How, how it meant.
'Cause I didn't understand; but I understand it.  This is it.  I'll
sing it anyhow.
