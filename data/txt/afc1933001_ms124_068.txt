Chapel Hill, North Carolina

Dear Miss Wilcox:

I am indeed sorry that you will not be in Kentucky this
fall for I am afraid my collecting work will be confined to
that area. If you ever come to Washington, as I hope you shall
some day, I should like to record your songs for permanent deposit i
in the Archive of American Folk-Song. In the meantime, if you
should feel ready to deposit your collection in the Library of
Congress, we should be happy to accept it under any reasonable
restriction you would care to impose.

Your mention of a "contest" in Bloody Breathitt" interested 
me greatly. Was it a folk-song contest? And, if so, who
was in charge of it?

I hope that your collecting trip to Eastern North Carolina
is a successful one and I regret not being able to accompany you.

Thanking you again for your kind letter, I am

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge,
Archive of American Folk-Song
