         I could do it. I'm away from home an' ah, an' nobody much
is know me in New York [you all].   See?   I could jus' go out there an'
be one of the biggest blues singers an' the biggest dancers an'
then, one of the biggest hell-raisers goin'.  See?   Nobody don'
know me.   See?   If I, if I, if I didn't care nothin' 'bout myse'f.
Ya see?   If I didn't love that that God give me.   In other 
words, I wanna be, I wanna rise with the [Christian] quickenin' spirit that God
