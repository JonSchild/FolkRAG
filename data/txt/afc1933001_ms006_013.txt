General Delivery
New Orleans, Louisiana

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I received this morning your letter of July 19th, from Baton
Rouge, with Mr. Garwick's letter enclosed. I am much distressed
to hear that the machine is not giving immediate satisfaction, and
I am particularly disappointed, because the tests to which the
machine was subjected in my presence in New York, and the recordings
which I myself made, seemed to indicate a remarkable degree
of perfection. Mr. Garwick picked up radio music, and I spoke
and sang into the machine. When played back, the discs gave a
very true and smooth performance, though the metal discs seemed to
me possibly preferable to the celluloid ones. I am sure that Mr.
Garwick will, in his own interest, see that the machine is put into
working condition. His willingness to join you in Memphis should
be a guaranty.

As regards the weight of the machine, I understand that it
does not exceed the specifications, but, if anything, is slightly
less. Apparently any machine, dependent on batteries, weighs more
than one fed on light current. I understand, however, that you
felt a battery machine was necessary because of the likelihood of
your wanting to use it in places where light current could not be
had.

I am most grateful to you for your interest and for your
prompt and minute reports. I trust that you will keep me informed
about the progress you are making with the recordings. In the
meantime, I am holding up Mr. Garwick's voucher until I get more
encouraging news from you.

With kindest regards and best wishes for the ultimate success
of your trip, I am

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Music Division
