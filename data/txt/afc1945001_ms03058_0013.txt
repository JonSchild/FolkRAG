interested in getting back into office, than in the welfare of the nation.
Milwaukee, August 8

The tax bill won't be passed and signed until after the election.

RATIONING
Sure, we'll have gas rationing; right after election.  They don't dare
ration anything else until after the election, but then, boy, watch lots of
things be rationed.  Milwaukee, August 3

Gas rationing in the Middle West is coming soon, certainly after election.
Milwaukee, August 7

Cars or tires or both will be requisitioned, probably right after the
election.  Milwaukee, August 8

AGRICULTURE
Sure, the farmers have the best crops they ever had, and they can't get
labor to harvest them.  There are going to be lots of dollars of stuff 
rotting in the fields.  Milwaukee, August 5

The government asks the farmers to produce more, and then lets farm prices
get out of hand.  How can they expect to get farm produce marketed.
Milwaukee Aug. 6

Crops are going to rot in the fields because they can't get enough help
to harvest them.  Milwaukee, August 6

PRICES AND SHORTAGES
I may as well start eating out, prices are going so high.  Milwaukee
August 3

Ceiling prices? -- Why I've got to pay more for nearly everything than ever
before.  Milwaukee, August 4

I tried to get a pork roast -- but no pork.  The butcher said he didn't 
know when he'd get some more, either.  Milwaukee, August 6

You just can't get the meat you want.  Our butcher hasn't had any pork
or ham for a couple of days.  He said the government had better start doing
something about it, too.  Milwaukee, August 7

I haven't had any trouble getting the meat I want, but I hear lots of people
have been having trouble getting what they want.  Milwaukee, August 6
