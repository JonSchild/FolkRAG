Dear Mr. Lomax: I am trying to get the title of a
book of Cowboy songs, also name of the publisher,
put out by Ina Sires some 10 or 12 years ago. At that
time she was a teacher in the Dallas schools.
Think the title of the book carried 'Southwest'. As
there have been only a few books of this nature
published - thought maybe you might have a copy or
be able to give me some data on it.
Have called your residence several times but no
one answers. Would you be so kind as to call me
during day - 7-9731, Statio 369, or in the evening at
2-7251 (White Plaza Hotel).

Florrie Wade.
