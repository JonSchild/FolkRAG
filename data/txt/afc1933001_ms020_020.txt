John A. Lomax, Esq.
University Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Mr. Engel has just returned your report, which
is to be printed in full and almost as it stands.
Before submitting it to the Librarian Mr. Engel
would like to add to it a brief statement of the
amount of material collected (number of songs and
records, exact or approximate). I shall very much
appreciate your letting me have these figures as soon
as you can, preferably by wire. And if you will supply
an identifying address for the Grant family, O
shall be glad to insert it.

Father asks me to pass on his congratulations.

Cordially,

Chief, Division of Music.
