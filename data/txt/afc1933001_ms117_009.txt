Dear Alan:

Your report and various letters all arrived within the past
few days. If I do not answer everything in detail, rest assured
that I complied with all your wishes just as soon as I learned of
them. I wired Thompson and received an answer in a few hours
telling me that the discs were sent out on January fourth. You must
have them by now. I spoke to everyone regarding your salary.
Your letter came too late to affect the first check but future
checks will go to you by air mail care of the American Legation.

Record everything you hear, you won't regret it later. I'll
write you more later when things ease up a bit.

Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke

P.S. We just received another letter from
Thompson saying that the discs did not
leave until Jan 14. Please notify us as
soon as you receive them as I am
holding up the bill until I hear from you.
Please do not use 10 inch discs if you can
possibly avoid doing so.
Regards,
H.S.
