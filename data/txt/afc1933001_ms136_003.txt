Dear Mr Lomax.
I'll write you again as it
has been some time since Ive
heard from you but I have
been long waiting for those
records you promised to send
me and would like to hear
from you again and would
be much pleased to get those
records. I have sure watched
the mail for them and I
know 3 or 4 months is a long
time to look for any thing.
Mr Lomax if there is going
to be any expence to cutting
those records and more then
