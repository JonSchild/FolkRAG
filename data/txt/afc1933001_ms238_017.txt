Indians from New Mexico will also
be presented during the Folklore
Society's Convention.

The New Deal had nothing to do
with setting up the U.S. Government's
schools in the Panama Canal
Zone! I got a raw deal here
in respect to a teaching position
that was rightfully mine and I
know of nothing than would give
me more genuine pleasure than
to get an appointment with the U.S.
schools in Panama - a position
for which I applied in the spring
of 1937. It was given to a person
who isn't filling the place satisfactorily
and to the one who once was unprincipled 
enough to tell me that she
didn't think it was being filled properly -
by another person who has since
married - and thought I should have
it. And old big hearted McCluskey gave
her this job at Waldemar one summer
when she had to attend summer school
and said one didn't want to give it
back to her the next summer! Such
is life, isn't it? That explains my
asking for your help.

Anyway I am keenly awaiting Alan's
appearance! Will you and Mrs Lomax be
down? I hope so.   Most sincerely,
Frances McCluskey
