[*5. 10. 13 . 19*]     A   Nim - [*[*]Nimrod was born in 1895, when Tug
River - ah, near the mining country of West
Virginia, and ah, ah grew up in a long life
family.  His grandmother lived to be 118, and
ah, um, he intends to live that long himself.
[*[*] So the folk memory in his family goes back
ah nearly 200 years.  And in that  he captured 
some very old songs.  On of themis the, is
the - perhaps the oldest ballad we have in
English, the song about Bangham and the boar.[*]*] 
A, a report on some sort of magical boar hunt
[*NW 4*]     in, in ah - way back in the darks of, of
British history, hunting a, a, a boar with a 
wooden knife.  And wooden knives were used a
few hundred years ago by hunting.  His daughter
Phyllis, who is ah - who has learned his songs
by simply watching him with adoring eyes all 
of her life, sings it for us now, and, and
ah . . . you can see the meaning of it as the
light glitters in the face of this man, who's 
the hunter and descendant of generations of
hunters that goes back far into time. [*]*]
