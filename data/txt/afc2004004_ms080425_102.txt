Just the one that's doin' the keyin'. There'll be somebody there that's
pitchin' the song. Most leaders don't pitch the tune. The one that's
pitchin' the tun'll give everybody their sound.

...

Well, a lot of people sings the part that they're used to.I
know a lot of triple singers who get and lead and sing triple while they
lead and if some of the altos might not know the tenor and they know the 
alto, they sing alto. It doesn't make any difference.

Or bass?

Or bass. As long as you keep the class together and /you make your selection.
It's very democratic. Everybody's callin' on the lead ... make a selection
of their own choice. And a lot of people I've seen that don't even , not
even sing, just beat time

...

My observation of people from other parts, the tenor is likely, you
know, not understand what's happenin' to him, or anythin' ...

Well, yeah, that's true. But unusually the tenor is fairly well anchored
with a veteran who's not gonna let you, who's not gonna let you down. They
gonna hold you up, and if you can't beat time they'll--lots of times when
I'm settin' on a front row, I'll watch the person's, the leader's mouth
because I can tell more about what he's gonna do or what she's gonna do by
the movement of her mouth than I can of her arms cause there's /no tellin' which way her arms
gonna go, and I want to stay with her. But if there's gonna be no indication
of how fast you're gonna go or how slow, well then I try to go by the movement
of the mouth.
