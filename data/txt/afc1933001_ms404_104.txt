Uncle Bob Ledbetter
According to his own story,
Uncle Bob was born west of Oil City.
He didn't go to school; "My father
knew book-printin', he had
print-learnin', and he learned
me how to spell out an old fashioned
spelling book. He didn't know nothing
about writing. He made me
copy out of a book. I never went
to school an hour in my life; 
but I can send a letter anywhere in
the world. I can't write it pretty, of
course."
"I never was in jail in my life.
I didn't go to see my friends there.
I always said "Practice makes perfect'
and I stayed away from the jail.
My father learned me what was right
to do and I tried to do it.
"My father sang religious church
songs. I sang fiddle reels, - not a 
fiddler, though. Everywhere you
used to hear me I was singing
*reels.
*"Where did you learn so many
songs, Uncle Bob?"
"Jes' brudderin' around,
jes' broadenin' around."
I joined the church at 19,
married at 20, just started in the
20's.
I believe in [conjure?] if you let 'em
put it in you, put it in your coffee or food."
