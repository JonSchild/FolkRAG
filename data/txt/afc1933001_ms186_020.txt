TO THE CHIEF OF THE
Music
DIVISION
September 18, 1942

Attached are two letters from Miss Thelma James, successor to Emelyn
Gardner, in her folk-lore work in Wayne University. Miss James took her
Ph. D. in folk-lore under Archie Taylor and is one of the most competent
scholars in the field in this country. My contact with her this summer at
the Folk-lore Institute convinced me of her executive ability, her capacity
for getting work done efficiently and her genuine interest in the field of 
folk-song. Her proposal should receive your most serious consideration,
because I feel that through it a very important job could be done in morale
building work in the Detroit area. Perhaps, if the Library does not feel it
can back Miss James by furnishing her equipment and disks, you could
request the Librarian to take the matter up with one of the foundations.
