BJ TAPE 6,  p. 33

biggest fights ya ever mess up with.   An' I jus' doN't like that.
See, I like good times.   If everybody git high or too lit, don't
flatter 'im; put 'im to bed somewhere or other -- or her -- an'
let 'im go to sleep.   Sleep it off an' wake up.
AL:    Don't do what to 'im, Bessie?
BJ:     Don't flatter (flatten ?) 'im; take 'im out, "Git outa here,"
you, you know what I mean.   Outdo's an' make 'im leave there
drunk, staggerin' an' all that kinda thing.   You know, if he kin.
But some people, ya cain't let 'em stay, ya know, ya got to let
'em go. But if -- I like to deal with peoples [that,] that kin
lay down an' take a nap an' git on up.   An' I like to treat
folks in a way so even if they husban' was to go drunk at my
place or, or, or where I was at,an' I had to (SOUNDS LIKE "DOMAIN") to
'em, they would be satisfied that he was jes' drunk there.   You
see?   I like to, to live that way.   That's why I can go anywhere
in the worl' I want to go -- I ever been -- 'cause I [knows people] never treat 
nobody, you know, never, (cloaked ?) no woman's husband never had [one] none. You
know, I don't want none.   'Cause they, they ain't mine.   An' if
I cloak 'em in mine, I don't like all kinda nasty in my house,
ya see? [But yet, I] 
         But yet, I have a big time.   I used to sell liquor, make
liquor, run it.   Yeah!, God.   I run moonshine.   Make it an' sell
it an' take some of the roughest chances ya ever seen in your
life.   But I ain' like no roughness.   Ya see.   I like the, sm-sm,
makin' a nice step to hell.   Tha's all, jus' a nice one.
         But if you gonna do a thing, do it indecent an' honest.
An' [say] all, because that wa'n made up with no slammin' (???) aroun'
an' cussin' an all that ol' mess, an' I jus' couldn't, couldn'
never stoop to that.   Ya see, tha's all, jus' never [could see] did.
