Philadelphia, Penn.
Dear [?] Dealy,
John A. Lomax has sent me your letter and I should like to
tell you [that] for the Library that we are much interested in the
songs and ballads you mention. Would it be possible [?] for you to
send copies of your collection to us for examination and possible
permanent deposit in the Archive of American Folk-Song?
I know the song you mention, but at this moment I am packing
my equipment for an early departure tomorrow morning for Kentucky.
I shall be there for two months making records of Kentucky [fok]
folk-songs. In the mean time, however, let me refer you to two books
where [I] you can, perhaps, find the song:
English Folk-Songs from the Southern Appalachians, by
Cecil Sharp, Volume II.
Folk-Songs of the South, by J.H. Cox.
We look forward to seeing your collection.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
