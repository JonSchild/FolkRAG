Reverend Roe.  Reel 4. P. 6
When I look out on His Creation,, I see white deers, black deers, and
all different colors; I see the same in cows, I see the same in hogs.
Then I look out at the earth, and I see the flowers He made, and I
see some red, some blue, some white, all coming up on the same ground.
It's a mystery to me but it's God, and He must meant for us to live
together, He must have meant so, and that was God's way in beautifying
our world, and I believe it would be so beautiful if all of us, I
don't know as we have any need for you to have a white Momma and me
a black Momma, I don't mean that because theys a white flower and a
blue flower and they keep their seed apart and every one produces theri's
own kind, don't it, and that could be same with us
