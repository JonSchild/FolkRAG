Dear Smith Cason:

We have decided to use another of your blues
in our South American album. This time it's the blues
called "Shorty George", and it occupies one-half of a
fifteen inch record. The fee for use of this song is
$7.50 along with two copies of the record for your own
personal use. This of course, is in addition to the
money and records already coming to you from our
previous agreement. I trust you will sign the permission
which is enclosed and return it to us Air Mail. By
the way, I should tell you that copies of the records
will not be ready for several weeks.

Thanking you for your previous kindness,
I am

Your friend,
