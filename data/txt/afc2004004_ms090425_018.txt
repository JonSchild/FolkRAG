S:  Well, they sing in opening Devotion, in raising collections
and all like that.
A:  Could that be sung at a baptismal time?
S:  No. No sir.
A:  What do you mean when you say I'm gonna tell how they did me down
here?
S:  Telling high tribulations and whatnot.
A:  Of slavery?
S:  Whatever oppressing.  Whatever troubles happened to them.  That's the 
way they have of singing off their trouble.
A:  What do you mean when you say slipping and sliding?
S:  Well, when we get in Heaven, we're gonna have a good time (laughter
from the congregation).  We'll forget all about that (Amen) and express 
ourselves to God about trubles making the trip.
A:  Why do you sing about Daniel in the first place?
S:  Well, we refers to Daniel because Daniel went through the same
troubles that we are gong through here.  See, because he was persecuted
and put in the lions' den for the Word of God and all like that.
So we get Daniel for our listening.
A:  Well, who did you learn that song from?  Do you remember when you
learned it?
S:  Yessir.  From my grandmother.  I heard my grandmother sing that
when I was a boy.
A:  Did she have anything to say about that song that you can remember?
S:  Yessir.
A:  What did she tell you?
S:  She said in slavery times they wouldn't let them to have a free
occasion to worship like we are doing today.  They would get off in 
some secret place in the woods and they would put their heads around
