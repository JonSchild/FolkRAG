Our Western Home.

Words by Dr [Brewsly?] Higley, and
music by [Darriel] Kelley, both of 
Smith County, Kansas in 1873.

(1)
Oh give me a Home
When the Buffalo roam.
When the Deer and the Antelop play.
When seldom is heard
A discouraging word.
And the sky is not cloudy all Day.

Chorus.
A home. A home
When the Deer and the Antelope play.
When seldom is heard
A discouraging word.
And the sky is not cloudy all Day.
