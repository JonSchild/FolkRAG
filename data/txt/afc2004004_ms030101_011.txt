life but are part of the common
repertoire of folk singers
throughout the country.
(Jackson's maid, by the way,
is not saved from the gallows.)
He has plenty of spirit 
and is a past master of the 
yips, clucks, and howls with
which cowboys ornament
their singing, but he is absolutely
incomparable when it
comes to broad, slow, melancholy 
tunes, like his versions
of "Utah Carroll" and "I'm
Gonna Leave Old Texas
Now." There are real heartbreakers,
and their effect is
enormously enhanced by 
Jackson's way of trailing off
in volume and going slightly
sharp on their long, sustained
notes.
Jackson has style, knowledge,
and integrity, and
his big set has been edited in
keeping with its importance.
The notes are by Kenneth
Goldstein, the distinguished
folksong scholar, and are the 
first by this authority -- at
least the first I have seen --
to contain the melodies of

the songs in notation as well
as their texts and information
regarding their history.
These transcriptions were
made by Herbert Haufrecht,
who must have had the
devil's own time with them,
for Jackson, like all true folk
singers, never sings two successive
stanzas precisely 
alike, but changes rhythm,
pitch and intervals as blas
may dictate. In most cases,
Haufrecht has notated only
Jackson's performance of the
first stanza, which is the correct
procedure, unless one
has the space, a la Bartok, to
notate every last variation, 
for the first stanza usually
provides the essential form
of the tune as it lingers in the
singer's mind.
Such notations are extremely
valuable, since they
clarify the general shape of
the melody They are equally
valuable in clarifying the
structure of the melody, but
concerning this, unfortunately,
Goldstein says nothing at
all. A glance at his booklet

that Jackson, who sings without
accompaniment and
therefore has no instrument
to determine keys for him,
possesses a very special
fondness for the key of D. A
great deal more is apparent
in these notations, but not
even the most obvious characteristics
of the tunes are
discussed. Such discussion is
the next necessary step for
Goldstein and for Folkways.
Folklorists with a literary
background often make a distinction
between folklore and
musicology; this however, is
a false and misleading distinction
and the analysis of
the tunes belongs in a publication
of this kind quite as
much as the tunes themselves.
No one who heard Shirley
Collins at the University
of California's folk
festival last fall needs to be
told that she is a folk artist
of major quality. She comes
from Sussex. Her repertoire
is largely English and Irish.
As the title of her record,
False True Lovers, suggests,
her emphasis in this collection
is on lyric songs and on
ballads of desertion and
pathos, but she also presents
some ballads and songs on
livelier and happier themes.
Her style is the quietest,
simplest, subtlest in all the
world; it is completely folkloric.
but with a delicacy, a
refinement, and fragility all
her own. Accompaniments,
on guitar and banjo, are
provided by the singer herself
and by several collaborators, 
and these also are
very beautiful.
There is something unique

cans. Perhaps it is only because
Shirley Collins is
Shirley Collins. For the
great paradox of folk song
is that in its true tradition it
allows the interpreter only
the narrowest latitude for individual 
expression and yet
brings forth everything the
individual artist has to give.
It is the purest mirror of
human personality which the
art of music affords, and is
the only form of music
known to the Western world
in which there can be no
faking, subterfuge, or cover-up.
A singer has it or hasn't
it and if he or she hasn't 
it, folk song will reveal that
fact in the most completely
devastating way. Harry Jackson
and Shirley Collins both
have it to the highest degree.
