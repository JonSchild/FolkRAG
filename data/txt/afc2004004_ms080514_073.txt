The women and the children had to be ah active 
in the fields and do hard work in order for 
- to make the crops.  And so anyone who 
slacked got punished.  The old man had a hard 
hand and they were afraid of him, most of the 
time.  Women stood while the men ate, and 
served them, and it wasn't considered, ah, out 
of the way.  Because in the early days a man 
had to be ready to grab his rifle and, and 
fight off Indians or outlaws.  And when they 
walked through the woods, down the narrow 
trail, the women carried the burden and the 
man ca - went ahead with the rifle.  And if 
you didn't understand that, you didn't under-
stand the mountains.
