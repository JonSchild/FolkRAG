Dear Sir:

I have read with interest the article, Ten Thousand Songs, condensed from
The Saturday Review of Literature, by Donald Day, for your magazine --
Oct. Number.

I have known Mr. John A. Lomax for many years, and having been born in the
very heart of the great cattle country of Texas makes me doubly appreciative
of the splendid work Mr. Lomax has done in preserving many fine Amerian folk
tunes -- some of which might otherwise have been lost to the general public
had it not been for the untiring effort of this collector of tunes.

However, regarding the origin and success of the song Home on the Range, Mr.
Lomax with-held [sic] much important information concerning this particular song.
In fact it is my belief that he, for personal reasons, deliberately evaded the
whole truth regarding this much publicized song of recent weeks.

A year or two before Mr. Lomax heard Home on the Range sung to him by a San
Antonio negro, he might have seen this same song from my pen had he been
sufficiently interested in what I went to Austin, Texas, to tell and show him.
I, having heard that Mr. Lomax was collecting American folk tunes, took, with
me, several of my, then, unpublished songs based upon cowboy tunes.  Home on 
the Range was one of those songs.

Mr. Lomax spoke with me briefly but did not ask to see or hear my songs.  He
gave me the impression that he thought I might wish to encroach upon his
field -- that of collecting folk tunes.  Since he had little to say to me, I, 
being rather young, felt embarrassed and left him after a polite and short
interview.

Several years later, G. Schirmer published my song Home on the Range with
