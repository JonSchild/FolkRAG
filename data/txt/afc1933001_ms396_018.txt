few of her songs. I remember that she sang me the first blues that I
had ever heard, moving me almost to tears; and a pathetic ballad of a
factory girl, who got splinters in her toes. Many and many another she
sang that, unhappily, are gone with the Texas wind. 
Finally she sang:
Whoopee ti yi yo, git along, little dogies,
It's your misfortune and none of my own.

I had never before heard it.
"To me," she said, "that's the loveliest of all cowboy songs, 
Like others, it's rhythm comes from the movements of a horse. It is not
the rioterous, hell-for-leather, wild gallop of 'The Old Chisolm Trail',
nor the slow easy canter of 'Goodby Old Paint'.  You mustn't frighten the 
dogies. They get nervous in crowds. Lope around them gently in the darkness
as you sing about punching them along to their new home in Wyoming.
They'll sleep the night through and never have a bad dream.

She knew only the chorus and a 
stanza or two. I got more of the song
later from half a dozen different people
[seven parts] - seven stanzas in all
when published Git Along Little Doughies
introduced a new word, and the song
sing with its repeated phrases, Got Along Little Doughies gave
Billy Hill a dynamic phrase for 
his beautiful Last Round-Up
