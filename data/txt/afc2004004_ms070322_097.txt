Saturday - At breakfast on the boat.

I thought I'd never get a 
bed last night. The boat was
jammed & no reservation had
been made. If I hadn't
I'd have been dead this morning.
As it is, I'm still sick for
sleep. Still feel as if I hadn't
slept for a year - like a man 
after a battle.

This morning I had nearly
a normal pre-piss hard. Not
complete, but almost. It's normal
for me to wake & fuck in the
morning. It's what I want &
the woman I want will, I hope,
want it, too.

It ruined Robin's day. Or else one
had to wake... till 11 AM or 12 before
she woke naturally out of her compulsive 
sleep & her natural frown?
