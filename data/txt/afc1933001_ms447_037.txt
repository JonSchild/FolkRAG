JOB 
[*double column the whole page*]

The whole song in congregational singing would probably be repeated.
The leader sings the story, and the congregation agrees with "uh-huh"
throughout the spiritual. The short lines of the concluding stanzas, although
doubled up for convenience in printing, are to be sung like the lines of the
other stanzas.

I O Job, Job, (uh-huh) 
Oh, what you reckin? (uh-huh) 
Your children's dead. (uh-huh) 
O Job, Job, (uh-huh) 
Oh, what you reckin? (uh-huh) 
Your servant's dead. (uh-huh) 
O Job, Job, (uh-huh) 
Oh, what you reckin? (uh-huh) 
Your daughter's dead. (uh-huh) 
Just listen at Job, (uh-huh) 
What Job said, (uh-huh) 
"Oh blessed be (uh-huh) 
The name of the Lord. (uh-huh) 
The Lord he giveth, (uh-huh) 
And the Lord take away, (uh-huh) 
An' blessed be (uh-huh) 
The name of the Lord." (uh-huh)

Chorus: 
Oh, run Mount Zion,
Run Mount Zion,
Oh, run Mount Zion in the mornin'.

2 Oh Joshu-ay (uh-huh)                              23
He prayed to God (uh-huh) 
To stop the sun (uh-huh) 
Right on the line. (uh-huh) 
And the battle was foughten (uh-huh) 
Ten seven times (uh-huh) 

Choruses:
An' the sun stop steady,
Sun stop steady,
Sun stop steady in the mornin'.

Oh, swing low, chariot
Swing low, chariot,
Oh, swing low, chariot, in the mornin'.

I want to go to heaven,
Want to go to heaven,
Want to go to heaven in that mornin'.
