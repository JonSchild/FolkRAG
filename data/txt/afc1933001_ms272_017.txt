Honey ?

Honey Honey bless your heart,
My Honey that I love so well;
For I've been true, Sweetheart to you;
To my honey that I love so well.

The Infantry

The Infantry, the Infantry with dirt behind their ears
The Infantry, the Infantry, they drink up all the beers.
The Cavalry, Artillery, and corps of Engineers
They couldn't lick the Infantry
In a hundred thousand years.

Home Boys Home

1. Man born of woman was a sailor for to be
He's born to degradation in every degree,
Of guard mounts and gun drills he never has his ease,
He has so many masters that he dont know whom to please.

Chorus
Home, boys, home, it's home we ought to be!
Hone boys, home in God's country!
The ash and the oak and weeping willow tree-
Oh we're strong for the Navy, but it's home we ought to be!

2. Go to the Captain if you want to get away,
Off on leave for a month, or a day:
Write out your request, he'll sign it if he can
You can go away and not come back,
he doesn't give a d---!
Chorus.

3. Go to the Executive if you want to get a boat,
To visit some friends on some other ship afloat:
He gives you the wherry, you can pull it like a man-
You can take a boat and drown yourself,
he doesn't give a d---!

4. Go to the Chief if you want some speed;
He shuts down the shower bath and turns it into feed.
You ring up three turns faster,
and the ship ahead your ram.
The Chief he gave you twenty, and he doesnt give a d----.

5. Go to the First Lieutenant
if you want a piece of wood,
A keg of nails, or steamer; and be it understood.
Each one has a different little plan-
It's down on the card index, he doesnt give a d----

Write your own verse!

X Fight Away.

Fight away, fight away, all you Army men in grey
Go charging down the Field, A smashing ev'ry play
Thru Navy's line, ev'ry time!
Break with all your might
No Navy in the world can stop old Army's
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Round her neck she wore a yellow ribbon.

Round her neck she wore a yellow ribbon
She wore it in the winter and the
merry month of May;
When they asked her why the hell she wore it
She said 'twas for her lover who was
far far away,
Far away! Far away!
Oh, she wore it for her lover
Who was far far away
Far away! far away!
Oh she wore it for her lover who was
far far away.
----------------------------
God Bless America, Land that I love
Stand beside her - and guide her-
Thru the night with a light from above.
From the mountains - to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam
God Bless America - My home sweet home.
---------------------------
Let me call you sweetheart,
I'm in love with you.
Let me hear you whisper
That you love me true.
Keep the love light glowing
In your eyes so blue,
Let me call you sweetheart
I'M in love with you.
---------------------------
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus.
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Glory Hallelujah!
Sometimes I'm up sometimes I'm down
Oh, yes, Lord!
Sometimes I'm almost to the ground
Oh, yes, Lord!
Nobody knows the trouble I see
Nobody knows my sorrow;
nobody knows the trouble I see
Glory, Hallelujah!
