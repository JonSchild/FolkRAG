ple were right and the people were 
wrong, but they were righter more 
often than anybody else. And he'd 
found out that democracy was right 
and democracy was wrong, but it was
righter than anything else. And it 
wasn't a question of maybe, or if, or 
someday. it was now, any old time, 
the sooner the better, let's go.
   Occasionally Johnson sang a spiritual 
that ended, "I ain't got long to 
stay here." But he hasn't found out
what he came to find out.
   He's sixty-three now. He married a 
good woman, whom he calls "the 
missus," and they live on a farm with
their three daughters. Johnson knows
how to milk a cow and how to midwife 
a goat, he knows whether it's going to 
rain and what the corn looks like it's 
going to do. He likes a bowl of common 
wild flowers on the table. He eats
in his shirt sleeves, and takes off his
shoes and listens to Charlie McCarthy.
His health could be better, and his 
health could be worse.
   You've seen him, I think. You've 
never noticed him, but I'll lay you a 
bet you've seen him.
   He goes around with his hat pulled
down and his collar turned up, and he
doesn't look like he'd come up to you
and ask you for a dime, but he doesn't 
look like a good prospect to ask for a
dime either. He climbs up on a stool
in a Greek restaurant and hollers,
"Scup scoffee." He walks down the
street eating cherries out of a bag and
seeing how far he can spit the stones.
     You've seen him.

Saves His Butts

HE WON'T wear a full-dress suit for 
anybody, and he wears long woolen
underwear and ear muffs in the winter.
He smokes nickel stogies and 
puts the butt in a case for next time.
He watches steam shovels and forgets
he has an appointment. He's always
swapping stuff he doesn't want for
other stuff he doesn't want. The other
day he saw a sign saying Papaya Juice,
and he bought a bottle of papaya
juice.
     He gets on a train with a bag of
peanuts and a brown-paper bundle. 
Inside the bundle are a couple of
homemade sandwiches and a seventy-
five-cent thermos bottle full of coffee.
When the passengers complain to the
conductor about the peanuts, and the
conductor complains to Johnson,
Johnson says this is a free country.
Then he and the conductor get to
chinning about conditions.
     He used to worry about not having
a profession, a business, a racket.
Every time he sat next to a fellow in
a Pullman smoker, the fellow asked
him, "What's your line?" Johnson
had no line, and he didn't know what

the fellows in the smoker. Johnson
just goes ahead and does it. He sticks
his head inside a pie wagon because
he wants to know what the inside of a 
pie wagon looks like. He goes around
the country, up and down the country,
asking everybody, "Where do you
come from?" "Where are you going?" 
"Do you think you'll be here forever?"
"Where do you go when you go back 
where you came from?" "What's
