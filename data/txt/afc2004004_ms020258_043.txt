HAMBONE
A game chant

Hambone, Hambone, where has you been?
All around the world and back agin.
Hambone, Hambone, where did you go?
I hopped up to Miss Lucy's do'.
Hambone, Hambone, what did you do?
I got a           and I fairly flew.
I asked Miss Lucy would she marry me.
Said, "I don't care if my daddy don't care."
The first walked in was Mister Snake,
He crawled all over that wedding cake.
The next walked in was Mister Bug,
Flew all over that liquor jug.
The next walked in was Mister Tick,
Ate so much that it made him sick --
Not ham!
Not ham!
Not ham!
