Reverend Roe. Reel 3. P. 4
of old quotes -- it may be imaginary, but we can get lots of things 
said, you know, like now when after Noah come out of the Ark, and I 
believe the people then were in what they call the [Dispension] Dispensation of 
Covenant,[in] they was under the Covenant with God, and when Nimrod went out to plant 
to Shilah and [to] built the city of Babylon [to] & started the tower. [You] We know what 
period that was in, you understand. And it was there that God scattered the folks, 
and made different nations, not races, because there ['s always been] ain't 
but one race, that's human race, which is nations. And then He sent
