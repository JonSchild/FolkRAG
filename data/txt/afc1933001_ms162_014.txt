LEXIE DEAN ROBERTSON, Poet Laureate
of Texas, was born in Texas, and grew up
among the saplings of which she writes so engagingly
in one of her verses, "Sky Riders,"
which has proved so popular with audiences of
all ages:

"What fun to bend the young trees down
Till bright leaves swept the earth's rich brown,
Then mounting one like a winged horse,
Away we'd ride on a magic course."

   Her education includes graduation at North
Texas State Teachers College;  A. B. degree from
Howard Payne College, and post graduate work
at the University of Oklahoma and Chicago
University.  She married Jack Robertson -- "one
of the livest and most likable business men and
Chamber of Commerce Secretary in Texas or
anywhere else" -- and together they taught school
for several years.  Now they live in "Two Oaks
Cottage," in the little West Texas town with the
poetic name, Rising Star.
   From contributing humorous verses to a
newspaper column she became interested in writing
poetry and was almost immediately successful
in winning prizes and marketing her output.
She became a member of The Poetry Society of
Texas and captured the major award, The Old
South Prize, for her poem, "I Have Heard
Whippoorwills," the Texas Prize for "The
Wager," and tied for the Alamo Prize.  In a
nation-wide contest sponsored by Kaleidograph,
she won first prize for her poem, "The Seeker."
