Tape 88. Bob Roberts. . .recorded & interviewed by Alan Lomax.
1) O once I had an Irish girl, but she was fat and lazy,
Away, haul away, we'll haul away, Joe.
And now I've got a Suffolk girl, she drives me nearly crazy,
Away, haul away, we'll haul away, Joe.
2) For girls were made to love and Kiss, or so me mother told me,
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe.
3) King Louis was the King of France before the Revolution,
King Louis got  his head cut off, and spoilt his constitution.
4) Away, haul away, we'll haul along the bowline,
Away, haul away, the packet, she's a rollin'.

1) Take the wax out of your ears and listen to my yarn,
It's a story of the sea I will relate.
I'm a sailor you can tell, by my fresh old water smell,
Many a time have I been shipwrecked, lost and found.
2) Now once aboard a four wheel craft, silver plated for a mast,
A cargo of fried fish we did invite,
O we hadn't been long at sea when we struck a Christmas tree,
And we all fell down a coal hole in the sea.
Chorus:
Singing, lower your funnels, drop your jib, leave the anchor chain,
Throw the main-deck overboard and haul it back again,
Won't you hoist your lifeboat up aloft where stormy winds do blow,
Heave ho! Heave ho! ship's struck land!
3) Now whilst cruising round the lake we'd a marvellous escape
When the wind blew off the skipper's wooden leg,
Just to air all our woes, we all went down below,
Got blue-blind paralytic drunk from drinking castor-oil.
4) O, and as we lay there drunk, well the good old ship, she sunk,
And we all roused out on deck to see the fun,
Then with the cargo on our back, for the shore we all made tracks,
And we went and dried our whiskers in the sun.
