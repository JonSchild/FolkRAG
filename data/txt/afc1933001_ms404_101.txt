[Noll] Noel* Lebeau, a creole of Shreveport,
had lived to manhood near
Lafayette in Southern Louisiana. Though
twenty years absent from that section 
he could not forget the
French songs of his childhood.
He sang these songs in our hotel at Shreveport,
La., playing also a trumpet. He was messenger
for a [?] [?], intelligent and neatly dressed. 

*Named Noel " 'cause I was
born Christmas Day."
