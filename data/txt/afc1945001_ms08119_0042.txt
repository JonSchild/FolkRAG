A
Shoe Rationing
Gee, when we girls heard about the 
shoe rationing we were sure astonished and
just didn't know what to do. One day be-
fore they start rationing, and here she had
only six pairs of shoes and she really needed
more, especially sport shoes. After 
hearding that No. 17, cupon was good
for one pair of shoes she was horrified
and felt like going to Germany and
give Hitler some of American fighting
spirit in his face. Other girls say
"Gee but I sure must take 
care of No 17." meaning their shoes.
