Some rumors are simply direct expressions of prejudice.
Prejudice is literally "pre-judgment". Denial of prejudice is useless,
for the person already has the judgment. The traditional advice concerning
not arguing religion and politics represents the tacit acknowledgment
that in these spheres, prejudice is such as to prevent argument on a
rational level from being significant. Such argument generally serves
merely to cause the holder of the belief to assume his position with
greater vehemence and to develop negative emotional attitudes towards the
person propounding an opposing belief. It must be recognized that there 
are prejudices outside of the realm of politics and religion which people
maintain with the same degree of [heat] fervor. If the direct counteraction program 
attacks people's prejudices crudely, directly, it will be found very soon
that those attacked will be completely alienated; whereas, as attack upon
material of a less emotional nature will not produce the same result.
Rumors which are motivated by fundamental anxieties of a person
can rarely be dealt with effectively at a rational level. While it is true
that what may be an expression of anxiety for one person may function very
differently for others, since the same rumor may have different meanings for
different people; nevertheless, we should be very careful not to reinforce
latent anxieties by calling attention to the foci of the anxieties of other
people. People's anxieties tend to be [pretty] deeply rooted and simply
attach themselves to one thing or another at the level of overt manifestations.
If a specific detail is eliminated from them, another focus will be used. For
this type of rumor, the indirect attack should be used and most careful attention
paid to this category by the Education Director.
