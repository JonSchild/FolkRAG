Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I hope you swim to Cincinnati; you will make that much better news.
Miss Waller of NBC warns me you still have not "told all," and I cannot
advise you from what studio in Cincinnati you will broadcast until I know
more.
In regard to copyright, will you please consult Kenneth Berkeley, NBC,
Translux Building in Washington to be sure you are in the clear? You might
tell him you are doing so at the request of Miss Judith Waller, NBC educational
director in Chicago. She mentioned this morning the need for
a list of songs you will use, giving, name of song, composer and publisher,
if any, even if the songs are from the public domain. She also
said she would need copies of unpublished songs and your signature on
releases she would give you. I hope a talk with Mr. Berkeley and a written
statement from him may relieve you of some of these requirements.
Will you sing? Do you need a piano or any other instrument? If you will
not need an instrument, you can broadcast from a small studio at the
Netherland Plaza Hotel. Otherwise you will have to broadcast elsewhere.
Since you do not know where you will stay and it might take a little time
to investigate the river, bus stations, garages, etc., in Cincinnati,
will you be good enough to let me know where I can locate you, as soon
as possible after your arrival? I have just this morning bad word from
New York about a change in time for another broadcast--the European situation
is of course creating havoc with radio plans--and I might have
urgent need to get in touch with you.
About your title: we have been using "America's Folk Ballads," the subject
I mentioned in my first telegram, in our publicity. I hope that is satisfactory.
The station announcer will introduce you, using a very short continuity
I have written. I made it brief purposely because I did not want to use
any more of your broadcasting time than I could help. You should have
a full 13 minutes, I hope, for what you have to say, or sing.
My office will be in the Netherland Plaza Hotel on the third floor so you
can easily reach me. I will meet you at the waterfront, however, if that
is essential.
Sincerely
(Mrs) Beatrice Sawyer Rossell
