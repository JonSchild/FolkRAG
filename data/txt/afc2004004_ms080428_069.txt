And that's true also of this ballad, ah,
Loving Henry.  Here we have the two things
coming together, the talking animal and ah
the end of illicit love.

Ah, the girl invites young Henry to come back
and see her, they are lovers; when he leans
over from his saddle, she stabs him with her
little dirk.  And then she and maidservant
throw him into the well, and the little
poll parrot has seen it and ah this parrot of
course is the spirit of the dead man, and
she beseeches the parrot not to tell, but he
refuses - refuses her gift of a golden cage
with golden bars, and flies into the highest
tree, and the girl is exposed and, and she
and the maid are ah, ah, executed.  Assuagement
of a guilty conscience.  But a lotta fun along
the way in fantasy.  And that's the story of 
many of our ballad singers, and many of our
best ah classical ballads.
