Attached is a recommendation from Mr. Lomax that we work
out a cooperative recording project with Dr. Roy Mitchell of
New York University. Mr. Lomax believes that this will not
involve over 50 records (and cutting needles, etc.) during the
present fiscal year. I recommend that this project be approved,
the cost, ca. $50, to be charged to Increase.
