No.  1     A Message to Mother 

Take this message to my mother, 
It will fill her heart with joy ; 
Tell her that her prayer is answered, 
God has saved her wandering boy. 
Tho' from home in sin I wandered, 
And it almost broke her heart ; 
Tell her to be glad and cheerful, 
Never from the Lord I'll part. 

CHORUS 

Take this message to my mother, 
It will fill her heart with joy ; 
Tell her that her prayer is answered,
God has saved her wandering boy. 

2 

When I left my mother's presence, 
How her heart did ache with pain; 
When she said, Good-bye, God bless you,
We may never meet again. 
O my boy, just look to Jesus, 
What a friend He is to all; 
Only trust Him, He will save you,
Don't you hear His sweet voice call? 

3 

In the fields of sin are many, 
Who have wandered far from God; 
Will your mother's prayers be answered?
Listen, sinner, you are barred. 
Often you have heard His warnings, 
In your heart conviction deep; 
God is calling to you, sinner, 
Ask for mercy at His feet.
