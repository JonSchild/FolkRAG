Mr. John A. Lomax
c/o Henry Zweibel
Fort Spunky, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is simply to acknowledge your
recent note, written as a postscript to
Mr. Thompson's telegram, and to say that
we have received, in addition to the 79
records mentioned the other day, a second
shipment, containing 148 records. This
last lot has not yet been checked over -
I presume that it completes the recordings
Alan made this summer along the coast.

May I hear from you soon about the
Carnegie report?

Cordially,

OS
