Mr. John A. Lomax
7456 San Benito Way
Dallas, Texas

Dear John:

You bet I know that you do not forget Crozier. Your
warmth of sympathy and friendship has been attested on
numerous occasions.

It was a real pleasure to receive your letter congratulating
me on my appointment to this office. I was also
interested to receive the enclosure about "Our Singing
Country".

I hope to have a visit with you soon, and learn more
about what you and Alan have been doing.

This is the man who was so good 
to a couple of down and outs - at
least I was. He would appreciate 
a line from you. [?X]

Sincerely yours,

Harry
Harry Benge Crozier
Commissioner
