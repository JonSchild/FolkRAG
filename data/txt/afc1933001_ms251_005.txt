Shirley has been to Mobile again and
back to get ready to meet Chris
at Charleston, S.C. Last night she
had a telegram to stay here until
further notice. The vessel is already
delayed for two months and more,
account of sabotage, fires, labor
inefficiency, fights between A.F.L. and
C.I.O., etc. Chris is the only medical
officer on this ship. As long as 
the ship, if it ever gets out, is in American
waters Shirley and the children
will be skipping around from
port to port to see him, if only
for a day or two. Meanwhile they
have a home here. They've sold
their home in Lubbock.

Et fin. I wonder if you have
saved the long letter I once wrote you
from Europe when you were working alone
up in Michigan? What I said then represents
[my] the bed-rock of my feeling for you.
Affectionately, Father
