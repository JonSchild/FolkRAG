Alan and I will go in to Columbia
and hear the Lunsford records played.
We can then be able to report our
opinion as to their value for your
collection We have found a
reproducing outfit in Yale where
the Lunsford records may be reproduced
for the Library of Congress
at a very small expense above
the cost of the blank records.
I thank you for the
copy of the letter you wrote Mrs.
Flanders. Should our plans 
change will let you know.
Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
