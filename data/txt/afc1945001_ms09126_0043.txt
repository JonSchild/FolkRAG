      There are (a great deal of) many rumors 
heard in reference to the war. This 
is something a good Citizen will 
overlook. The war is something that 
did not (had) have to be but is. My pledge 
is to think before I speak, and also 
before I act(ed). If every one did this 
I'm sure we'd wipe the Japs. 
      Boys and girls in my classes 
in school sometimes give their 
opinion of the war. It is to me 
like a dream I never ended. 
But as I think more about it.         Folder 126
