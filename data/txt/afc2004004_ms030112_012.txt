GD:      Now you lookin for something for nothin, why 
you might as well go home and sit down, you 
understand.  Because you ain’t gonna have anything. 
You lookin for something you gotta 
bear whats in it to get it.  Did you hear that?
LJ:        A ha.

GD:      Thats true.  Theres only one [type] kind of a person, who 
gets something and don’t do nothing for it and 
then they have to do something for it to get it. 
Now you take the hoodlum, I’m telling you this, 
now I don’t reckon no hoodlum in the house Im in 
now.  I hope you not them. [(?)]  [Theres] Then sometime 
you don’t know who you is. I want you to listen 
at me good.  When push comes to shove and shove 
comes to a rush.  If anybody asks you who you is, 
you tell him you don’t know who you is.  If you had 
any sense you tell him you don’t know who you is, 
you be telling the truth.

LJ:       LAUGHTER.

LR:     There are sometimes when I feel like that.

GD:     Well if you feel like that, you just like you feel. 
You hear what I say? A man can’t be no more than 
[*just*] what he feels.

LR:       Thats right.

LJ:        What was that you once told me, Rev.Davis, “He 
that thinketh in his heart, so is he.”
