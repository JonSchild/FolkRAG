In re: Pearl H. Staut

Dear Mr. MacLeish:

The Archive of the American Folk Song in which the songs you
helped collect in Arkansas are deposited, has long been engaged
in a program of recording the folk music of the United States.
We have sent recording machines into many regions of the country
to take down folk songs from the lips of people who know
them and are most anxious to continue to enlarge our collection.
The cooperation of the National Congress of Parents and
Teachers is naturally extremely welcome to us. It would seem
to me possible for the Archive to arrange to record a sizable
collection of songs which you had located in any region or state
in the United States. In states where there are active collectors,
we can enlist their help. In other situations, we send a sound
truck to do the job. By next fall we expect to be in the position
to duplicate for public use four thousand records which we already
have and this practice will naturally make this material
available to you and your organization, along with the material
in which you actually participate. A check list of these songs
will be completed in the summer and a copy mailed to you on publication.
Enclosed you will find the press release announcing
the establishment of the phono-duplicating division of the Library
of Congress and describing its services.

We have already assisted in the establishment of state
archives in Michigan and Florida at their respective state universities, 
and we are anxious to encourage collections of this
sort. In such cases, we have assisted a local collector in the
early stages of his work by furnishing discs, needles, and etc.
in return for the deposit of the original recordings in the Archive
of American Folk Song. Duplicates of his records were
returned to him and these made the basis of a state archive. We
feel that this process can grow and continue.

It would be of great interest for the Archive to learn of
the work of the Association in the field of folk song and its
plans for collecting. We shall be happy to cooperate in any way
possible.

Respectfully submitted,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
