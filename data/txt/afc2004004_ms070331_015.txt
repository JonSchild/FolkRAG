NOISIEST AND FAVORITE SONGS OF
CAMP ANISFIELD

1.
There is a tavern in the town, in the town,
And there my true love sits him down, sits him down
And drinks his wine 'mid the laughter free.
And never, never thinks of me - thinks of me.

Chorus:
Fare thee well, for I must leave there.
Do not let the parting grieve thee,
For the time has come for you and I to say goodbye.
Adieu, adieu kind friends, adieu, yes adieu-
I can no longer stay with you, stay with you.
I'll hang my heart on a weeping willow tree
Fare thee well, fare thee well, FARE THEE WELL!

He left me for a damsel fark, damsel dark,
Each Friday night they used to spark, used to spark,
And now my love who once was true to me,
Takes that dark damsel on his knee, on his knee!

Chorus:

And now I see him never more, never more,
He never knocks upon my door, upon my door,
And in his stead, he pinned a little note,
I'll read to you the words he wrote, words he wrote!

Chorus:

Oh, dig my grave both wide and deep, wide and deep,
Put tombstones at my head and feet, head and feet,
And on my chest just carve a turtle dove
To signify I died for love, died for love.

Chorus.

2. 

Oh camp A-N-I-S-F-I-E-L-D.
The place where everyone here loves to be.
Come new and old and gather 'round,
And up to heaven we'll raise a ripping, roaring sound.
We are the c-a-m-p-e-r-s
Are we a peppy bunch?
Why - yes, I guess!
We are the same that put the aim in fame, always game,
Camp Anisfield.
