The underlined words are titles of songs. 
Once there two gentlemen, standing 
on the corner. Mr. Black and Mr. Brown. As 
usual they had got up on the subject of 
the war. Mr. Brown says "I dont want to set 
the world on fire" I just want to give Hitler 
the hot seat. So Mr. Black says, yes I have three 
sons in the army and "they would be so nice 
to come home to." The other gentleman says "It all 
comes back to me now" My nephew just wrote 
me an he said when he gets through, that 
Mussiolini, Tojo, & Hitler will be "three rats in 
a tub." and they'll "want to move on the outskirts 
of town." He says many of the boys out there 
say they don't like Hitler cause "his feets to big".
Mr. Black
