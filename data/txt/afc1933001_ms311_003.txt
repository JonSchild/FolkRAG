all day on the prair-ie in the sad- dle I rides not 
my ciel- ing is the sky, my floor is the grass, 

even a dog, boys, to trot by my side 

Oh, give me a home where the buf-fa-loes roam, where the
deer and the an-ti-lope play. Where sel-dom is heard a dis-
cour-ag-ing word and the skies are not cloud-y all day. Oh
home, a home where the buf-fa-lo roam, and the deer and the antelope
play.
