defective for all of us.

We should want to give up
some things so these men
will have the energy and ambitions
to fight with.

Ask yourself this; What am
I doing to help kick those Japs
and Germans? Your answer should
be, I'm doing my part by filling
every empty space in my stamp
book. I'm collecting rubber, iron,
paper, and things that I think
may help us to win. Come on
Americans, do your part today.

We Will
We Can
We Must
