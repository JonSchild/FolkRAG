Dear Mr. Ward;

One of my problems with the book was
the gap between all inclusive title and the rather
narrow and poor choice of material. As you point out
the fiddle tunes and the play party song material is
quite good, but there the book pretty much ends. Very
few of the ballads are traditional folk songs.

I do not like to appear captious, because
I think the more attention paid to traditional music the
better, but I felt embarrased about not reviewing the
book and want to explain it some how. I think your editor
made a very bad choice for the title. I trust you will not
let this letter go further than your desk.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
