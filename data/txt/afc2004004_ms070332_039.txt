interest and significance for others. Just as a folk song or folk
tale cannot be said to have a real existence apart from its singing
or telling, so in all folklore collection the foreground, or lore,
must constantly be related to the background, or life.

In helping supply this social background the data compiled
for A Guide to Composite America will be of great value. At the
same time the personal histories and interviews compiled by
folklore collectors can be of equal service in social-ethnic
studies by showing how the songs people sing and the stories
they tell grow out of or are adapted to the work they do and
the things they know and believe in. Finally, in addition to
the human interest of its everyday use, folklore possesses the
poetic interest of idiom, imagery, and symbolism which provide
forms and material for the artist.

As part of this social and functional study of folklore,
The American Folklore Guide is further interested in the process
of making and remaking which, in the course of its adaptation to
time and place, folklore is constantly undergoing. Not only do
modern conditions (as in urban and industrial areas) give rise
to new forms and material, but every variant and variation has,
above and beyond its intrinsic interest, value for the student
of the history of  a particular item and the processes of oral
and popular composition and transmission.
