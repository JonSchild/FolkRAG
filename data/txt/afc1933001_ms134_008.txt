Dear Dr. Putnam: 
Mr. Alistair Cooke, in the accompanying letter, has described briefly to you a series of programs which he is preparing for us to be broadcast in Great Britain in July, August and September.

This Corporation has for some time been contemplating such a series which will present to British listeners some of the folk songs of America about which so little is known by our countrymen.  It is a series which we consider of considerable importance, but in our view an essential factor is the authenticity of the material presented.  This corporation entrusted this series to Mr. Cooke with every confidence.  He has in the past presented a number of programs for us, and we are fully satisfied that his knowledge and experience of American Folk lore insures that the essential requirement of authenticity will be met.

As Mr. Cooke tells you in his letter, he was dismayed to find how little authentic material was available in the commercial market; and he is as a consequence most anxious to draw upon your collection of recordings.  Both Mr. Cooke and this Corporation realize full well the unusual step we are asking you to take, and it is needless to say how grateful we would be for your assistance in this way.

One thing I must make quite clear.  This Corporation, unlike the American broadcasting companies, is not a commercial company.  Broadcasting in Great Britain has been entrusted to the State, and you can feel entirely assured that in no way will your material be used for any commercial purpose whatever.

Yours very truly,
Felix Greene
For THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION
