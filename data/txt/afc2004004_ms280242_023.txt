9) So come all ye jolly ploomen lads, a warning tak by me,
If ye gang doon to Tarvis, dinna get on the spree,
But seek for ye requirin' and steer your course for hame,
And if a row gets up in Tarvis, ye winna get the blame.

Very well-known ploughman's song. . .Very far back. . .

The Dowie Dens of Yarrow:
1) There was a lady into the North,
You could scarcely find her marrow, (equal)
She was courted by nine noblemen
In the dowie dens of Yarrow.
2) Her father had a plougboy,
O him she loved most dearly,
She dressed him up like a noble lord
And sent him off to Yarrow.
3) These nine noblemen sat drinking wine,
Drinking to their sorrow,
O the fairest maid they ever saw
Was in the dowie dens of Yarrow.
4) "Did ye come here to play cards or dice,
Or did ye come here for sorrow?
Or did ye come here to slay us all
In the dowie Dens of Yarrow?"
5) "I neither came here to play cards or dice.
And I didn't come here for sorrow,
But one by one, as long as ye'll stand,
In the Dowie Dens of Yarrow."
6) Three he drew and three he slew,
And three he deadly wounded,
Till her false brother, John, came running in,
And pierced him through the middle.
7) "Go home, go home, you false young man,
And tell of your sister's sorrows,
That her true lover, John, lies dead and gone
In the dowie dens of Yarrow."
8) "O mother dear, come ready my dream,
I hope it won't prove sorrow,
That my true lover, John, lies dead and gone
In the dowie Dens of Yarrow."
