licked. . .An' at time I looked down the track, I see the man come
runnin', Mr. Dickson, the man that worked there; he said he seed (sic)
me sittin' on the track, you know, when he went to get some fittlers.
Fittlers along the side of the track; you pick up fittlers (BJ says
"fittlers" -- not fiddlers; gather they are like crickets) to fish
with.   He said, while he pickin' up the fittlers, he look again, he
didn' see nothin' but Jig -- you know, this dawg, his name was Jig --
lookin' down there.   An' he run right away.   He didn't know but what
I might been fell, or was hung, of sumpin'.   He was runnin'; that man
was almos' out of breath. When I look up, he was runnin' ! He say,
"Woman, where you been?"  I say, "I go down to get my hook unhung."
He say, "Don't you do that again!"   Heh, heh.   He was so scared;
he didn't know what to do.   Then I got scared; I got real scared, heh,
ha.   I could hardly look down that place; I got so scared afterwards.
I'd a-never tried that again.  But that was sumpin' to look at.  That
ladder straight as it can be.   Ain't no tilt in it at all; that's
straight!  An' I went down that thing. The Lord had really took care
of me.
