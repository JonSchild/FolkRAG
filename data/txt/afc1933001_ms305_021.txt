Blitzkrieg 
Among the Intellectuals 

George Seldes

HISTORY is moving too swiftly 
for many persons. In Poland there 
has been a real Blitzkrieg, a lightning 
stroke, from a technical military 
viewpoint one of the most brilliant 
campaigns in all recorded time. But 
it has also been a war of diplomacy, 
bloodless victories, pacts, new alignments, 
new creations, new overthrows, 
which have come so suddenly they 
have caused a tremendous confusion 
throughout the world. 

Confused people do many things, 
they jump from the trains of history 
when they round their first sharp 
curves, or they leap into the sea 
when the ship of progress on which 
they are having a peaceful voyage, 
meets its first storm, and some just 
withdraw into themselves for a long 
period of naval contemplation which, 
judging from the First World War, 
may last them their lifetimes. 

But because the world is topsy-turvey, 
old orders change, and 
treaties of "friendship and mutual 
assistance" become scraps of paper 
overnight, it does not follow that the 
allegiances and fidelities of men of 
intelligence and goodwill may be just 
as opportunistically repudiated. Men 
of intelligence and goodwill are supposed 
to weigh, to think, to judge, 
and above all, to use reason. Isn't 
there a reasonable way of interpreting 
present history, now moving 
most swiftly on the wheels of the war 
machine? 

There are probably many reasonable 
ways. One would be to test the 
nations now engaged in the wars of 
arms, propaganda and diplomatic 
manoeuvring, to compare the ideas 
or ideologies (sometimes defined as 
"idle theorizing"), which are their 
driving force, to judge their contributions 
to culture, to the progress of 
people's betterment which we call 
civilization, and to adjust one's relationship 
accordingly. The evidence 
is overwhelmingly that all the national 
ideologies such as Fascism and Nazism, 
the Japanese form which provides 
a god-emperor, and the Spanish 
variant with a caudillo who goes 
to Mass between mass executions, are 
all fundamentally reactionary, that 
is, they intend going backward not 

forward, they plan a retreat from the 
battlefields which civilization has 
won after many centuries and many 
defeats, the most notable one being 
called the Dark Ages. This is logical. 
The proponent of the ideology of reaction 
for our time, the originator of 
Fascism, himself, declared (in Gerarchia,
March 1923) that Fascism is 
not afraid to call itself reaction as 
well as anti-democratic and anti-libertarian. 

As for the German form, or Nazism, 
we know it too well by its deeds 
to need any declarations, nevertheless 
there are instances where words speak 
louder than actions; thus, when Hans 
Johst, the president of the Poets 
Academy, says that "when I hear the 
word culture, I pick up my revolver," 
he tells us all we need to know about 
the New Germany. 

New Spain has become the oldest 
Spain, the Spain of the burning of 
books, of the Index Expurgatorius 
(which existed only there and never 
in Rome), the Spain of the complete 
elimination of intellectuals, by imprisonment 
and murder. Nor is 
Portugal, or Japan, or any other reactionary 
nation, at war or at peace, 
any more interested in spreading culture 
than it is in improving the living 
standards of its masses. 

The question of the position of 
Soviet Russia vis a vis the Fascist 
powers in relation to culture, was 
becoming acute just before the Second 
European War started: there was 
a manifesto by one committee of 
"cultural freedom," a counterblast 
by a similar league, and finally a 
protest against both by 400 unaffiliated 
liberals, progressives, trade 
unionists etc., who declared that 
"from the viewpoint of cultural freedom, 
the difference between the 
Soviet Union and the Fascist countries 
is most striking. The Soviet 
Union has effected one of the most 
far-reaching cultural and educational 
advances in all history." 

In all there were "ten basic points 
in which Soviet Socialism differs 
from totalitarian Fascism," and because 
the first was given as "The 
Soviet Union continues always to be 
a bulwark against war and aggression," 

the Russian trade pact with 
the abominable German Fascism become 
a bombshell in the intellectual 
dovecotes. It blew several of the birds 
right out into the raw, where they 
now sing alone, friendless, their song 
of self-pity; others have dropped into 
more friendly nests, one or two have 
joined the merchants of "confessions," 
and all, without exception, 
have been "attacked" by friend and 
foe, who demand a clarification of 
position. The 400 who signed the 
statement that Russia was different 
from Germany have now been asked 
to repudiate it; and even a greater 
uproar prevails in political circles. 

In all this hysteria and confusion 
the most formidable weapon against 
errors of every kind, Reason, has 
found little employment. There has 
been a leaping from trains and ships 
and dovecotes, and a retirement to
naval affairs, but no great recourse
to reason, since reasoning takes considerable
time. Admitting that history
moves onward with a greater
tempo every century, and that today
it is at its fastest, many of our confused
intellectuals have done their
leaping before their looking, they
have not waited for the express trains
of world destiny to arrive at any stations
in the long and difficult road
between reaction and progress.

Nevertheless, reason still requires
us to continue to apply the tests of
culture, of civilization, to the philosophies
or ideologies of all the nations
now engaged in the war, and not to
engage in mental Blitzkrieg, just because
history itself moves like lightning.
In a few weeks or a few months
something tremendous may come out
of the struggle in Europe: the destruction
of many anti-cultural ideologies,
the liberations of peoples, a
great upsurge in civilization. History
will move relentlessly, unaffected by
our mental jitterbugs.
