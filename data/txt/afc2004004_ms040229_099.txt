Have s[?]se, take food, needs God and there's no fear for you
[?]tho the wren be small it will make 
a noise 

Though the [?] be fine, it cares not who fears it

It is to please tabby that the cat croons

The king down and came for Ewan, and Ewan don't care a 
straw
I you can't bite, don't show your teeth

The waves have some mercy, but the roads none at all

Hero on the bad - Food will entice the mt. deer

Theme is meat and music here
As the fox said when running away with the bagpipes

The world will pan away
But love and music last for aye
