You didn't disagree with a white person.
CANRAY
No.  And then they. . .
A. LOMAX
They were always. . .
CANRAY
Oh yeah, they had some of them, they was awful.  Like if
they meet a black man and he had a hat on, you had to tip
your hat you know.  I fyou wouldn't tip your hat you had
disrespect and ohhh it was rough.
A. LOMAX
What happened if you didn't agree and you disrespected him?
CANRAY
Well, they was gonna start some trouble just like I done
seen many time, some of the poor guys would go buy on
credit, you know everybody was so darn poor.  And if he found
out if you had got hold of some money and didn't pay him,
they would put you in jail, put you in jail for so long and
then you turn around and you have to go back to work and pay
that back.  And you had all kind of ways. . .
A. LOMAX
You mean they'd just put you in jail for talking back, huh?
CANRAY
Yeah.  You know like if-if you go there and-like I would
borrow some money with you and they find out I made some
little bit of money somewhere and I hadn't paid you back,
well, they was gonna put me in jail there.  Keep you there,
keep us there for a few months and when you come out, you
had to go to work somewhere and find that man money.
(laughs) Oh, they used to be rough.  Like they had a sherrif
one time in Ville Platte, Evangeline Parish, there.
Whenever they would put a black man in jail there, he'd go
over there and strap him, take they clothes off and whip,
whip him until it was pitiful there.  Just so. . .
A. LOMAX
Why would he do that?
