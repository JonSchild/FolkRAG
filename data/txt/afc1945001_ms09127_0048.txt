[*A*]     Rumor

There is a rumor going around
that clothes will be rationed. 
People started buying more clothes
than they really needed. Washington
announced that there would be no
clothes rationing. That it was just another
rumor started by un-American 
people. 
Some person started a rumor
that even that we see pictures of the
food our armed forces are supposed to
get, they really are the most unfed army
in the world.
