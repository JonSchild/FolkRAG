Cooperation with Office of War Information -- Rumor Report
August 3 to 8, 1942

This is with reference to your memorandum of August 3 and the instructions attached.

During the period of August 3 until noon, August 8, I heard no rumors in any way relating to the war effort.

This may have been due to my being in contact only with Employment Service personnel during that period. 

I attended a meeting of USES personnel in El Paso August 3 and 4, returning to San Antonio on the 5th. The remainder of the week was spent in the Regional Office, and during that period I was not in contact with the public.
