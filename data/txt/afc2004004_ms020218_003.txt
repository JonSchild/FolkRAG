[*CHILD PUNISHMENT*]
[*sack whipping*]

BJ:     That's why I know that's your other boss, you see. . .But you
got down on the right wing now.
AL:     But you were sayin' that down where you come from there
were people that actually hung their children up. . .
BJ:      Tha's so.   Up in the houses, an' whip 'em. . .Well, Richardson --
I know some Richardsons used to do that.   I know some -- what that --
Robertsons, not so far from us.  They used do that.   Ol' big, great big,
ol' man, too.   He would hang those chilrun up in a sack on, y'know,
those jises (joists) across there.   Some a those houses had jistes across it,
you know, an' they jus' put that sack up there and hang it up on that
jise.   Let the chile be in the sack.   You know, he ain't hung; he's
in the sack.   But they jus' stan' back an' take that whip an' whip
'im.  Y'see.  An' that, like that.  An' sometime [a whole lot of] they whip 'em till the
blood come out like that.  In the sack, you can't get out.  You can't
run from 'im; you don't have to tussle with 'im at all.  They whup
them in that sack.   And let 'em there.   You see. . .Ah, I remember

twenty -- I reckon about nineteen years ago -- ah, myself, George
and Joe, my two boys, everytime I turn around they tellin' me somethin',

Heh, heh.   I put Joe in a big, ol' sack -- I thought I would punish
him -- put 'im in a big sack an' I cut some eye holes in it, an' I
cut his nose holes in it, you know, like his mouth and nose be out of it.
an' I laugh at that thing, it tickled me so bad when I caught him 
in there.  He look out of there, "Mama, what you gonna do me here?"
Heh, heh, he looked so funny, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. "What you gonna
do me here?"  I said, "I gonna make you stay there.  You go asleep
there now."  An' he got, he got in there and lay down, lay down
aside the window, in they room.  Near the window where he could
get [out,] air in there.  He go there, an' I know that.  He laid there
an' laid there.  I said, "Now he sure ain' gonna like that no more."
Chilrun playin' out in the yard. I went back in there for sumpin' nother
look out, those big, ol' eyes out, "Mama, how long I gonna stay in
this sack?"  Ha!  That face sure tickle me. I said, "You get outa
there; it ain't hurtin' you a bit; you ain't carin'!"   Heh, heh;
I chuck 'im out.   I couldn't bring 'im a that. . .I thought that was
a good punishment!   I didn't hit him; didn't [dare] whip 'im. . .But one
