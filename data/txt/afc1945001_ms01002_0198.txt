V.   A. Cont'd
         bitterness against Japan because it has disrupted their college career.
          Distinctly less excited about the war than the community.
     B. At University of Wichita--accepting the war, but not excited about it.
         Accept necessity of fighting war, but taking war calmly.  They think the
         objection to "goods made is Japan" is "silly".  Do not see why we need to
        "wipe out the Japs", etc.

VI. Tension Points--more acute:
       A. Labor.  The city population, as a whole, is neutral or even hostile toward 
           organized labor.  The C.I.O. demands permanent homes for the workers.  The 
           Real Estate Board, City Hall, etc. want demountable houses.

           The C.I.O. organizers have not deemed it wise to ask for a bargaining
           election.  A "shot" in the Miller Theatre (admission 40 Â¢) of John L. Lewis 
           was loudly booed.

        B. Negro.  Are loyal, and realize their lot under Hitler would be worse.
            But are pointing out that discriminations against them need to be eliminated.
       C. Salesmen, etc. who have lost jobs due to rationing --are beginning to express 
            resentment against these measures.  They are too old to find work in the 
            airplane factories, and feel the restrictions are too severe--that they 
            have not been considered.

VII. Suggestions:

       A. Efforts should be made to counteract the resentment against the car and 
           rubber restrictions.
       B. Some restraint should be imposed upon the ridiculous radio programs which 
           commercialize defense.  How buying Pepsodent et cetera for defense makes 
           sense--we can't see.

                                                                   Hugo Wall.
