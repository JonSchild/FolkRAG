 out the grave, I'll keep you out the jail," say--" If you
           kill a nigger, I'll hire another'n.  If you kill a mule,
           I'll buy another'n." ..One of those things. 
The Kid:    Yeah, yeah, I've heard that.  [That] On the levee camps
                 when the fellas used to so tired from carryin' logs
                 or somepin[x]t like that, they used to say, " Burn out,
                 burn up!.. Fall out, fall dead!" I mean that was the best
                 you could do--- you work yourself to death or prove
                 you're a good man.  That was all. 
Natchez:     I've heard of those things, too... But this Charley Hulen,
                  he was a fella that, if Loran or some of those bad white
                  guys was workin' a Negro too hard and the Negro did all
                  he could to try and please him and couldn't please him, 
                  the Negro would go to [him] Mister Charley and he would go
                  out and talk with this bad man or either, if it come to
                  a fight, he'd fight this bad man for the Negro...
                  He just was a man that believe in the right thing and he
                  wanted the Negro to have a chance to make a livin'. If the
                  Negro was a man that'd work and would try to take care of
                  his family, Charley Hulin wanted to protect him. [xx] You
                  get the point? 
The Kid:     Yeah, there was a lot of good people down there an'...
Natchez:   (Interrupting)  But the main thing about it is that some
                  of those fellas down there didn't ever think a Negro
                  get tired! (His voice broke as he said "tired and he 
                  went on, stuttering in his anger.)  They'd work him
                  they'd work him till[xx]...till he couldn't work, see?
