Dear Bill:

I telephoned Dr. Barbeau and the station manager at
CKAC (Biondi) to send me the list of songs which their singers
know and which can be cleared and they were to have written
my by today. Perhaps, the letter will come tomorrow morning,
if not, I'll call them and get the information over the telephone
tomorrow. You will hear from me again Thursday morning

Sincerely,

Alan
