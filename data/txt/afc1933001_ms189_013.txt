My dear Alan,

   I've enjoyed the checklist
of the records of Folk Songs
very much, so have others in
the town through the library,
Thanks to you -
   Now I'm interested in having
a few of the best Sumter County
records - Could I get some and
before Dec. 18th?  I'd like so
much to use them at a club
meeting - Of course I expect to
pay for these, but it would
take time to write to get estimates
besides I really do not know
which ones to select so I'd like
to leave all of that to your
judgement, and I will be
not only entirely satisfied but
very grateful.  As there are no
needles here I'd be so glad to
further impose & ask you
to buy a couple of packages for me
