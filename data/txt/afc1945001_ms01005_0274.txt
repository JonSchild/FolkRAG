Mr. Aaron S. Braverman
Grover Cleveland High School
Grandview Avenue and Himrod Street - Ridgewood
New York, New York

Dear Mr. Braverman:

Your recent letter to Kr. Davis concerning the
Rumor Clinic work at the Grover Cleveland High School was
referred to this office for reply.

Under separate cover, material is being sent to
you which may prove useful in orienting your fellow students 
towards important aspects of our war.

Concerning the Rumor Clinic, as such it is my
belief that this operation represents a technical task for
professional specialists in the fields of psychology and
sociology rather than an exclusively journalistic task.
Believe me, I do not underestimate the capabilities of the
students of Grover Cleveland High School, but I am afraid
that there is a tendency to underestimate the problems
involved in a rumor clinic.

In a very short tine, the Office of War Information 
will release material concerning rumor clinics and
just as soon as this is available, I shall send copies to
Hr. Tonsor end would suggest that you confer with him concerning 
this.


Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
