tape: Roll 49 Stanley 1
Ed: Stanley, you try to work one of these
Stan: I tried to work it, but there's a lot of people, I guess, like 
myself, they do much (unintel.)...I guess you make 'em, you can operate 
'em pretty good can't ya...
Ed: I can do it pretty good. There's some of these tourists that have 
a terrible time with them things. They get 'em and fiddle around 
with 'em, the G-hole, (?) and they never do nothin' for 'em...
Stan: They can't get it to do nothin'.
Ed, No, they just won't work for 'em somehow.
Stan: Well, it'll do that, if you don't know what your doin'.
Ed: They will work, though, let's see if we can get this one to work.
Stan: Let's see what it will do.
Ed: Well, we'll just cut it to G there...
Stan: There your goin' now, there you go...
Ed: Beginning to get some speed up... (unintelligible)...eh' it's just 
like drivin' a mule plowin' cotton.
Stan: You have to (unint.) pretty hard to get it to do that, don't you?
Ed: Yeah.
Stan: Takes a little while, but you got it goin' pretty good.
Ed: You see an old movie (?) of it, (unint,.)...
Stan: They's pretty stubborn.
Ed: Now I tried to show a man down in Hickory one time (unint....) give 
it a run...and he's so stupid he never did see how to run the thing.
He bought it anyway and put it onto his motel room. He fiddled around 
with it over there for a while. He comed back here and showed (unintel.) 
and said "I can work that thing perfect now!" He got it out and he 
started rubbing rubbing that thing just gettin' dizzy, he never could.
