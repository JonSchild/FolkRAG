VOLUNTARY OVERTIME

On April 8th, the Library local of the UFWA met with the
Librarian, to protest the hardship imposed on Library employees
by the present system of voluntary overtime in order to prepare
the Library collection against bombing.

The Union Stated That:
1.  Library employees had been asked why they had not
volunteered.
2.  Library employees had been telephoned and asked to
volunteer additional time when they had previously
indicated when they would be available.
3.  Library employees felt that repeated inquiries by
persons in authority regarding their intentions to
work, and the request to fill out "volunteer cards"
whether or not they planned to volunteer constituted
pressure - thus removing the work from the category
of voluntary overtime.

The Union Asked That:
1.  Coercion in connection with the present system
be stopped
2.  An appropriation be requested to provide personnel
for the safeguarding of the L.C. collection
3.  Compensatory leave be granted employees who worked
overtime, as is the practice throughout Government
agencies including the Library of Congress
4.  Library hours not be extended, since the burden of
overtime:
     a)  Falls hardest upon those whose income,
living arrangements, and other responsibilities
permit least change in
their living routines, and
     b)  Decreases working efficiency of employees
in the performance of their regular
duties
