BJ TAPE 7A, p. 94

     So I went up. . .I went up the hill.  [Went on] Started up the hill this
way, ya know, wit' the pole in front a me.  An' that make the
line ['way] weigh[t] right back to me, ya see.  He was a -- Ooo, Lawd!  An'
then I had to turn around an' go up the hill backwards so he could,
hah, so he could swing down.  Hah, hah, hah, hah!  Oh, I!
TL:  How did you get him home?
BJ:  I, I didn't get 'im off!  I got 'im an' put 'im down in
the yard an' he [ran] made it right at me again.  Oh, Lawd!  There, there I was.
So I was gonna try to kill 'im.  I wasn' scared of 'im, ya see. [(?)]
So I tuk the pole, an' I swung, swung it like that an' let the
pole go to, against the wall of the house, on the outside.   An'
I left 'im hangin', swingin' up there.  'Cause the pole was
(uncrossed line??).  I went up to the house where Mama worked.
Didn' even shet the door.  I went to the house. . .I had the back
door opened [any] in the house.  'Cause I could see the back do'
from the pond.
     I went on up to the house.  There I was, 'fraid.  I sit on
the stoop.  An' ah, Mama an' my cousin, they was jus' -- Oh, had
two pots a clo'es, boiling.  Ya know, [Mama be] them ol' big iron
pots?  Ya know, how ya boil [col] clo'es?  An' they were jus'
washin'.  Had a big wash, she had, an' everything.
     I sit there.  They can tell there's sumpin' wrong, I reckon.
Ah, [(lee, i.e.] Leola [?     they all)] said, "What's the matter
witchou?"
     I said, "Nothing."
     Mama said, "Is somethin' the matter witcha."  See, she, she
though some of the white boys or somebody been pickin' at me
of sumpin'.  She said, "What's the matter witcha?"
     So I said, said, "There's sumpin' on that hook."  Heh, heh,
