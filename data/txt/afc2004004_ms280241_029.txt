TAPE 83: JEANNIE ROBERTSON.
Lomax: Do you find that the Gaelic songs are different from the
Aberdeen songs? Ot do you feel that they're close?
Jean: Well, a Gaelic song -- ye dinna take so long to say the
actual words. When you're singing the actual words it's harder
to sing. Gaelic could be easier sung if you knew Gaelic. You havna
got so long to say the words.
Lomax: What do you mean?
Jean: Well, I mean, when you're singing Gaelic, it's shorter.
Lomax: But there's more repetition in Gaelic that in Aberdeen songs,
isn't there? More fal-the-lals.
Jean: Well, I think all Scottish airs are something like the 
Gaelic airs.
Lomax: You mean the songs you sing are like Gaelic airs?
Jean: Oh they are. They are Gaelic airs. Yes they are. If you get
peple to sing Gaelic songs that comes from there, it's often
like our kind of songs. Just the same song. It's in Gaelic, but
it's the same air.
Lomax: Can you think of a single example?
Jean: O I've known it with people who are from the highlands.
Thry used to diddle our tunes, and sing our songs, but it was in
Gaelic - but it was the same air. Because we've stayed beside
them and I've listened to them.
Lomax: These people that you met when you were travelling in the
summer time?
Jean: Yes, yes. I've lstened to the Gaelic singers on the wireless,
and we have just the same airs. So it must be the same.
Lomax: What about the slow tunes like "Bonnie Annie" or. . . .
Jean: Oh well, I dinna ken that.
Lomax: Some of the ballad tunes you sing. Do you find that they also are?
Jean: Well, maybe some of them the older ones. But the airs is
about the same. Alan, you see, some of these Gaelic airs is just
like the diddling pipe airs.
Lomax: Would you show me an example of diddling, Jeannie? I never
hear it.
Jean: I canna diddle. I know diddling when I hear it because I'm
up at many camps. If you hear that diddling - then hear folks
making imitations, it's no use. I've heard from these tape -
recording machines wi' people diddling -- it wasna diddling. It was
imitation. Every good pipe player can diddle because that's his
music. A pipe player he reads the music of the book and diddles
it off.
