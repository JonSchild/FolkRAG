Dear Alan: 

Charles Childs, the dealer in ship pictures at 171 Newbury 
St., Boston, writes me that he has discovered, at Stow, 
Massachusetts, "a woman who spent all her younger years at 
sea. Her father was master of a number of English sailing 
ships and later steam. She is a woman with a very retentive 
memory. She has a great interest in sea chanteys. I loaned 
my copy of your book to her and she read it with great interest, 
and I thought that you might like to know that she 
is familiar with many additional chanteys not in your book, 
and a number of English versions of those in your book. Perhaps 
if you are in Boston sometime and have a few spare 
moments I could arrange for you to meet her. She was nearly 
20 years at sea, and appears to know almost all the deep 
water ports frequented by the merchantmen of her time." 

I can't get to Boston this winter, but if you know of any 
collector in those parts who would be interested in getting 
this woman's repertory for the Archive, I daresay Mr. Childs 
could arrange it. 

Sincerely yours, 
Jeanne C. Colcord
