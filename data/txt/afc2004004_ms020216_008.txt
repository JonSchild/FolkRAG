BJ TAPE 3, p. 6

[*JOINS BAPTIST CHURCH*]

all times.  I don't care how ya pray and what ya do. 'Cause the 
Lawd said, "When you bow to pray, Satan present himse'f."  Ya see?
      An' right then, he come right in that little. [. I]  I was 
jus' speakin' of him to come in and say, "You were right.  Jus' 
as is, jus' [Just] as is."  See?  I went right on there an' I joined 
the Church and I was baptized, ya know.

AL:   Did you get happy?

BJ:    Oh, yeah!  I got happy.  Of co'se I fe't good an' cried. 
See what I mean?  After I come into it now, I know diffrunt.  It 
ain't no cry, it's joy!   Some say,
"I so happy, I jus' cry."  You're not happy when you cry, in that 
way.  Said the Lawd wipe away the tears; you be joy, 'cause 
you be really glad.  Co'se you kin cry for joy, ya understand, 
but you don't do it all the time, not, not with religion; you be's 
glad.  An', you know, 'cause it jes' tells it goin'.  You're 
free from that.  You -- Why, you're movin' those sorrowful tears away 
'cause you jus' -- there's somethin' more you need to do.  There's 
sumpin' else.
You know, sometimes you be condemned?  Yeah, you know, by a 
thing?  An' you jus' can't he'p but cry 'caue there's sumpin' 
you didn't finish, there's sumpin' you didn't do right.  You 
know you did it, an' somebody didn't know you did it, you know 
what I mean?  An' somebody, maybe, you know, jus' doin' it; 
somebody else may be bearin' the blame of it.  You can't he'p 
but feel indifferent, but cry.  So, that's why I feel like that 
was.  There's sumpin' more I had need to do, but I di dn't know 
it.  So I went on through with that.
