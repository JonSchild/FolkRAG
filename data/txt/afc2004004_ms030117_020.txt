11 

a many times where many people have been strung up on limbs
in the low counties and lynched.  Jes by lookin.  Sometimes.
Some men never done nothin but jes look.  See?  I often 
think of that.  Well, a body's eyes were made to look
right enough, but sometimes it pays a man to keep his 
eyes closed.  That's what the Scripture says. "If thy
right eye offend thee, pluck it out."  Sometimes you see
too much.  Sometimes you see things you have to tell
again about what you seen; an if you haven't see it, 
you wouldn't have to tell nothin bout it.
An I learned again that we ought to learn to travel 
sometimes by ourselves.  There's fortune sometimes in  
people travelling by theirself.
Jes like if you meet people an things are goin on in their 
home.  Ef You wouldn't carry it out, wouldn't be nobody to 
carry it out.  But if you got somebody else wit you they 
goin tell what they seen, an by you bein with them, 
an by them bein with you, will cause a great story 
to be told what could have been kept.  An that's what 
have caused a many enemies among people.  Have stopped
em out from many places that they could have been able to 
go on to.  I always have went along by myself from that 
cause.  Because I never have been no great talker.  I 
love to close in anything that I run across.  You can gain 
a h eap by keepin yo mouth shut.  Don't have to be no 
witness on no cases or anything when you keep yo mouth 
shut.  An yo eyes closed.  That's right.
(At one time yesterday, during our talk, you made 
the statement, you said, "There is no end to my tears."
