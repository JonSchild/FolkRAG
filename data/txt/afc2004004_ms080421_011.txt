RH:  Yessir, come right on down.  (Pause)   And so, uh, now...
over here if you can, I'd like for him to see it, I was tellin' you.
It's about, it's about done sheddin', but, uh, right here is a, is a
 ginseng, if you can see it right here, that's a, that's a bit of â€¦
thar's the berries, the fruit of it, it doesn't shed it off and I thought
there was another one here but I guess it's done died down;  it's late
fer it.  And this is the time of year now you start huntin' it for the
sale of the herbs, is the ginseng right there.  And, uh, and so right over
yonder now, that there paint blossom stuff right there, you see it's
blossom, that's what they call turtlehead herb, turtlehead or snakehead,
now we called it snakehead.  You see its head looks/like it's, its
bloom looks /kinda like a snake, and we gathered that.  And the big tall one
right yander, you see that big tall, right there, right through there
that big tall one with the seed pods on it, right there, that's wild
lettuce.
(Show me that one again.)
HR:  Right there, right through there, that tall one with the brown leaves dryin'
up, it's done went back...           but it's supposed to been good,
that's what we call wild lettuce.  The leaves you pull it off and it
was sold for herb, but I never did know exactly what they used it fer.
And I've got it right out yander is what that they put on your stomach here
back when they used to have a, the worms, and rub 'em back down from
chokin' you to death.  See, one girl my age choked to death with 'em
when they crawled out her nose hole.  And Dad and Mother got that on me
right there on the porch -- saved my life when I was about eight years old --
to run 'em back down and unball 'em.  They ball in your stomach, you
know, them worms, and that's, and they doctor it was a tansy (?).
