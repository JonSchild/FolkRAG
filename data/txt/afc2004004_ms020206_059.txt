Reverend Roe.  Reel 5.  P.4
R: Well, in some cases there was, but seldom. Now even after Surrender
there was some that wouldn't give their colored wives -- sweethearts--
[*Whites recognize Negro kinfolks*]
up, and we had so many boys and girls, some white and some half-white
that [were] is really sisters and brothers down in Louisiana today. And in
some cases, in a kind of a secret way, they kind of recognized your
white brothers will protect you, they won't [harm] own you, but if anybody bother
you, why, of course, they'll talk to them, you know in some way or
another. On several occassions, why, little things that we'd get into 
[now and then] down there, our white kinfolkswould tell them to let us alone, [but] and
[they didn't] they'd do it. I believe sometime that the boys that had our farm down there
were so mean, they would have killed me, I expect, but I believe I
could get everything straightened out down there now and get my farm
back because of the fact that some of those folks are still living,
you know, that know about it. But I [wouldn't] don't want risk my life for a
little black land. I'm doing all right, and I just don't want to
risk my life.
A: It'd be a rough time.
R: Oh yeah. Now if I wanted to go down and be mean and take me some
'45's and things, I could afford maybe to try. But that, of course, in
itself wold keep them off of me, you know, man to man; but knowing that I had
nothing, you know, with which to defend myself, why any one would
come and shoot me down.
A: Right now?
R: Yeah.
A: That's still rough country there.
[*Patterollers*]
R: Oh yes. And when I was a boy coming up there and I'd go out at
night, sometime I'd have to hide on [the] side of the road--I'd see
the mob coming. Well, they wouldn't have hurt me, but I would have had
to go on with [them] um for to do [the devil that night] their devilment. If I hadn't, they'd have give me a good whipping.
A: Well, was that common down there?
