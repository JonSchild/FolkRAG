Dear Dr. Spivacke,
I wonder if you'd ask your staff to
look up anything they can find that will throw
some light on the origin of this strange song---
the text of which is attached. It strikes me as
a sentimental song of the post-civil-war period,
that has been a good deal improved by mishandling
of the folk... The present text comes from
Tennessee and is on an old Vocalion record. We
plan to publish it soon.
My first Decca folk-song album is out.
What do you think of it?
I have started work on my book, also
my Guggenheim. I have borrowed a portable RCA
recording machine and will be making some
records from time to time during the spring---
stuff which belongs in the Archive.... A bit later
I hope to get a really fine machine... Can the
Library send me 100 twelve inch acetates and
a couple of recording needles? Can you also get
dubs back to me within two weeks of the time you
receive them there, since I will need the records
for transcription at once?
What is your rate for dubs now and how
long do you take for delivery?
The news is good from here. What about
you and the Archive?
Regards,
Alan Lomax
