English
A friend of mine has a relative
in the army. He is now overseas
and writes back as much as he
can about the conditions over there.
In one of his accounts, he wrote
of a friendship he had had
with one of the men in his troup.
He and this man have come
from the same city and so
got to know each other. Their
friendship was not to last
long. One night, in some
little town, this friend was
killed. My friend's relative
saw him get killed. A bomb
blew his head off his shoulder!
