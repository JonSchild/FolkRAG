BJ TAPE 6, p. 35

So that's the same it is by the law.   The law is -- Tha's,
tha's the portion of the law wit' God part.  He don't 'rest
you for what you do.   He 'rest you for what ya git caught doin'.

[*MAKING & RUNNING MOONSHINE*]
Tha's all.   'Cause I, I see the law so close to me when I'm
sellin' moonshine [that] it's pitiful -- I mean makin' it -- an' I had no
sense than to sit right there [(an' wait on Chester? -] with a
Winchester.   See?   A sin!  Ya got no better sense to do that.
An' they walkin' up there, jus' knockin' over stills, up over
the hill.  [All come outa the river] Ocamugie River, ya know.   Knockin' over
stills; goin' up over the hill.   Jus' put my [smoke an'] smother my fire down
an' everything [else.  Be right] an' leave it right there.   Saturday mornin'.   Soon
Saturday mornin', lookin' at it.  They didn' -- God didn' let
'em come that way; He wa'n' ready for me.   He have sumpin' for
me to do.Them folks woulda blowed my head off!   Ya see?   I was
right down underneath the hill; they was goin' on.   Folks
was lookin'.  Said, "Lord, Bessie, [how in the world...?] down
in the woods!"
         I said, "Down in the woods."  I just knowed they gonna
hear me down there.   An' so, ah, Nappa come down 'round the
edge of the swamps an' try to git me to hear -- To, you know, 
to, to come out.   An' I wouldn't move, 'cause if I move, I's
afraid they, ya know, they might [hit] [(git?)] hear me.  They, they jus' there
tearin' down (them stills?) upstairs!  God sent 'em on the other way, all
around.   An' then I come out.

[*19-20 CAMP BROOKLYN*]

BJ:     That was on the Okamugie [(?)] River.  Oh, the place ya
mean?   Camp Brooklyn.   Down there, Camp Brooklyn.  That been
years ago.
AL:    I mean, where was this, Georgia?
