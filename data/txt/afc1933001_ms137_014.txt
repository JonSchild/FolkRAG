Dear Alan:

                      Thanks for your letter of Sept. 1 and let me congratulate you on your fine production so far. My previous letter covered the question of finances and the sooner I get your answer, the sooner will you receive your money. 

                       We should have no trouble in arranging for the duplication of records for Dr. Walton. While on the subject of records, do you want the records purchased from Soundscriptions or Radioscriptions? Please let me know immediately as our stock is exhausted. 
               
                        I recommended the payment of $15 to Greene. 

                         I am glad to hear that the machine is working well. Be careful to mark those records made at 33 1/3 R. P. M. It is impossible to insure the machine (we investigated the question) as it seems to be illegal to insure the government property. So sleep with it from now on. 

                         Good luck!
                                                                     
                                                           Sincerely,
                                                                               Harold Spivacke
                                                                               Harold Spivacke
                                                                               Chief, Division of Music
