Keuillin' s Nae Sin:
Keuillin's nae sin, keuillin's nae sin ava,
If it wasna lawful, lawyers wadna allow it.
If it wasna blessed, ministers wadna do it.
If it wasna worth taking, lassies wadna tak' it,
If it wasna plenty, poor folks wadnae get it.

Whistle and I'll Come to ye:
1) O whistle and I'll come to ye, my lad,
O whistle and I'll come to ye, my lad,
Though father and mother and all should go mad,
Just whistle and I'll come to ye, my lad,
2) At kirk or at market where'er ye meet me,
Pass by me as though ye cared not a flea,
Jst gie me a blink o' your bonny black e'e,
And lookit as though ye cared no for me.
3) But warily tent when ye come to court me,
And comena unless the back yard be agee,
Sane up the back style and let nobody see
And come as ye werena coming for me.

The March of the Orange-Men into Glagow - Betsy Miller.
I saw this mesel', Alan.  I went to watch the Orange-Men's walk,
and I never saw a spectacle like it in my life.  Ye know, those big
tenements - and when the first of the procession came forward they
were emptying all sorts amongst them, - chamber pots and everything
plates, girdles, frying pans, anything thatcome to their hand.  Just
tossing them down on top of the mob.
Lomax: What happened to the people?
Besty: They just walked on.  What could they do?  There were
riots!  Scores of policemen there - ambulances, all sorts ...
