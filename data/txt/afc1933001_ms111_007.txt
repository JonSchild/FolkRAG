grow up in.  I'm not sure, but that's one thing to consider. I think you are right
in planting a separate menage not far away from us. So far as actual physical
space is concerned, we do have room for you and the children; but I have always been 
a believer in the theory that children should grow up under their parents' direction 
without interference, intentional or unintentional, of grandparents, uncles, 
aunts, etc. And then the children would hardly feel that this place is their very own, and th girls would not feel free to take over household  tasks, essential to their training. As for houses in this part of the city I can't say whether there 
are many vacancies. Perhaps you know that there are many new small houses in an 
addition[s] off the Garland road, east of Forest Hills. I'm afraid there aren't 
many trees, but I may be mistaken. There are trees in the addition on the part of Buckner Boulevard that extends from Garland Road to Northwest Highway, and I have seen 
some vacancies over in the additions near Virginia's part of town.

These are the ifs and ands that occur to me now. Let me say again that
nothing could make us happier than to have you and the children around. You will
have to decide what plan will make you and the girls happiest during what you guess will be the duration of the war.

I haven't let myself think that Bess is any special danger in spite of
news of air-raid warnings. And I don't think your father is worrying about her. 
Alan wrote us recently that he thought surely he would get away on his South American 
trip by February 1, and he would come by Texas, probably leaving from New Orleans;  
but I'm sure he cannot undertake this journey in these war times.  I have just heard 
over the radio of the passage of the declarationsof war against Germany and Italy.
Alan wired us recently to get recordings of reactions of several "average, colorful" citizrs to t he Japanese Agression. We recorded our neighbor, Mrs. Stilwell and her
80 ye rs of old mother; Dan Ruggles; another neighbor, Mr. Cook, who spoke of Cardinal Hull 
and the Nunited States, - bless his heart- he certainly is a representative American;
Mr. Potts; Dr. James J. Terrill; Mike, whose contribution Alan will enjoy; and Edward Crane.  
I don't know what Mr. MacLeish will think of Ed Crane, who advocates "wiping the
Japs and Huns off the face of the earth". We sent the rcords, as per instructions, 
in a wooden box, air express, cost $4.80. Alan says they want to use them as historical 
records and possibly for radio. He has machines out in various parts of the country 
and I suppose is getting reactions from these partstoo.

I have no news from my sister's boys since Sunday; Terrill will no doubt
be sent with the Hornet into the Pacific, or at least into action soon. Ben Stover expected 
to be married Christmas, but I hope he postpones that, because certainly he ought 
not to start a family and then go off and leave it for some one else  to support under 
these uncertain conditions. My friend, Mrs, Kahn, of Galveston writes that her son;s 
battalion was reported captured on Wake Island. He is in the medical corps; his wife is in 
Hawaii- Honolulu- expecting a baby soon. By the way, we have a new Terrill baby,- young 
Jim's and Catherine's, a cute little round-headed, red-haired girl, named Sallie. 
Dr. Jim says he is thankful that she was thoughtful enough to come on Dec.7, the first 
birthday of his other granddaughter, so that his failing memory will have only one date to [hold] celebrate for his grandchildren.

Have a cup of coffee with us? Your father's new regime calls for 
only one cup before breakfast, any other drink to be taken not at mealtime. Of course 
I have to be sociable and take one with him any time he gets ready for a cup!
I must go now. Bushels of love to you all. Is Willie still with you? Where will she
spend Christmas. Johnny writes his plans, which were governed, I think, largely by what I wrote him about Chris's leave: Dallas on Dec. 22 till Christmas morning, leaving here 
in time for Christmas dinner in Clarksville; return to Dallas Dec. 26; then to Houston 
Dec. 28. I had hoped that Chris would stay over one night so that he could get some 
of your mutual friends together. We shall wait now and see. Chins up!
