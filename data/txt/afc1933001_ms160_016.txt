Dear Miss Scott:

     Please withdraw the picture on the flyer, and use one
of the other good pictures I sent you. In fact, I'll be in 
a position to split the expense of a new edition with you provided
this one is withdrawn from circulation. it seems to me
that you might have sent me gallys on the flyer before you sent
them out and that you may have remembered that I protested myself
about the photograph in Program. I'm quite certain that
I do not like this photograph and I insist that no publicity go o
out from your bureau using this photo.

With best regards,

Alan Lomax
