I once had a boy
A bonny sailor boy
A boy you could call your own!
He ran away and left me
I dinnie ken where
But he left me to wander all alone.

One day as I walked
By the river side
Somebody caught my eye,
It was that boy
The bonny sailor boy
Wi another young girl by his side.

He gave me a look
Of his bonny blue eyes
And a shake of his lily-white hand,
I passed right by
And I never cast an eye
For I hate to be jilted by a boy.

The wind, the wind, the wind blows high
The snow comes falling from the sky
Mary Wood says she'll die
For the want of the golden city.

She is handsome, she is pretty,
She is the girl of the golden city
She is handsome, one, two, three,
Come and tell me who shall be.
