Dear Dr. Lomax

I have waited replying to your letter
until I was able to consult with Professors
Jackson and McIntosh of the Linguistic
Survey of Scotland and also with the
other officials of the Folklore Institute of
Scotland of which I am president.

We are agreed on the following points: -
1. Scotland is not a province of England, 
therefore Scottish folklore cannot be treated
on a regional basis like Corsican or Norman
folklore.

2. It is therefore very desirable that there
should be an album of records devoted
entirely to Scottish folkmusic and folksong.
We do not believe that such an album
would be in any way inferior to an
Irish album.
