Miss Jones adds a great deal of
color and flavor to her songs and
games with her highly colloquial introductions
which ramble through
black history, local incidents on the
Georgia coast where she has lived
most of her life and stories of her
relatives.
Occasionally her introductions
branch out in so many different directions
that she has difficulty
finding her way back to whatever
she was introducing. But this, too, is
a part of the very honest unpretentious
way in which she conveys what
amounts to a bit of living history.

30 Black Musicians Get
Ellington Medal at Yale

By JOHN S. WILSON
Special to The New York Times

NEW HAVEN, Oct. 80--Thirty
outstanding black instrumentalists
and singers last night received the
Ellington Medal from Kingman
Brewster Jr., president of Yale University, 
during a weekend convocation
called "The Conservatory
Without Walls"--a description and
celebration of the Afro-American 
musical legacy.
The medal, struck in honor of
Duke Ellington as part of Yale's Ellington
Fellowship Program, is, Mr.
Brewster told each recipient, "a
symbol of our appreciation of the
great art to which you have contributed."
The first to receive the medal
was Mr. Ellington himself, who was
declared dean of the Conservatory
without Walls by Philip Nelson,
dean of the Yale School of Music.
Others who received the medal
were the 83-year-old Noble Sissle,
an orchestra leader, like Mr. Ellington; 
and the pianists Willie (the 

Lion) Smith, Mary Lou Williams
and Eubie Blake .  .  .  . 
Three of the eight singers chosen
for the award--Paul Robeson,
Roland Hayes and Marian
Anderson--could not be present. 
But William Warfield, Joe Williams,
Marion Williams, Bessie Jones of
the Sea Island Singers and Odetta
accepted their medals in person.
The ceremonies started in an
aura of academic formality before
an audience of 2,500 in Woolsey
Hall.  But they soon became filled
with warmth and emotion as each
recipient hugged Willie Ruff, an associate
professor of music at Yale
who organized the Ellington Fellowship
Program.  And then the
medalists embraced "Dean" Ellington
with two kisses on each 
cheek, his customary form of greeting.
Mr. Brewster presented each
medal with a handshake until he
got to he last three recipients, all of
whom were women.  Marion Williams 
changed the procedure by
kissing Mr. Brewster, and Bessie
Jones followed suit.  By the time
Odetta was presented, Mr. Brewster
had got into the swing of thing.
He kissed her.

Sea Island Singer Preserving the
Songs of Slave Days

By ART HARRIS
Constitution Staff Writer

"You sift-a the meal, you give me the
husk,
You cook-a the bread, you give me the
crust,
You fry the meat, you give me the skin,
And that's where my mama's trouble begin. . ."

ST. SIMONS--Bessie Jones, 73-year-old 
folksinger and granddaughter 

of slaves, rocked back and forth
on the porch of her cement block
house--a converted beauty parlor
painted green--shook her tambourine
and soulfully wailed
"Juba," a song her grandfather
sang as a slave on a Williamsburg
plantation.
It is one of hundreds of songs
this septuagenarian--who doesn't
look a day over 45--has tried to
preserve through her solo work and 
as a member of the Georgia Sea Island
Singers, a highly renowned 
black choral group here.  Bessie
Jones, a Smithville, Ga. native who
grew up in Dawson, later moving to
St. Simons with her husband in
1936, is the only mainlander ever
admitted to the "Singers."
The "Singers," who periodically
perform on Sea Island--like Mrs.
Jones--sing to preserve the musical
traditions of their forebears.  They
were so impressed with Mrs. Jones'
effervescent personality, extensive
repertoire and singing style, they
invited her to join the group.
Singing and the dramatic storytelling
that went along with it, explains
Mrs. Jones, kept her grandparents' 
spirits up, though they
were downtrodden slaves.  "They'd 
make merry together, because they
didn't have anything else," she said.
"Specially when they had to work in
the brickyard."  There, the song,
"Way Down in the Brickyard," was
born.
Out of their experiences, good
and miserable, slaves made up 
songs that were handed down to
their children and grandchildren--
a sort of oral history of their attitudes
to life around them. Often,
explained Mrs. Jones, "the (slave) 
masters thought they was happy
and carryin' on havin' a time, but
the slaves was talkin' to the white 
folks about all their troubles.
"They (slaves) knew they wadn't 

gettin' nothin' for workin' in the
brickyard, so they'd sing about it."
And suddenly, this bounteous, big-smiling
black woman lapses into
"Way Down in The Brickyard."
"Here come Uncle Jesse across
the field. If you want Uncle Jesse to
do what you want him to do, put
some garlic in his shoes: If you
Want a sweetheart, put some salt
and pepper in his shoe.  .  .
"The whole thing," explained
Mrs. Jones, who likes to be called
"Bessie," "is that no matter what
you do, no matter how bad it be,
don't lay down to it."
"Ain't had a headache since
1924," she grinned.  Bessie says she
has never "laid down" to her "troubles."
"But one time I had a terrible
fever.  Don't like to take doctors'
medicines, but if I need a shot, I
take it.  'Course, I don't like it."
Bessie, who travels all over the
country to sing songs of slave days
and other works her ancestors
brought from Africa, prescribes her
own medicine Euell Gibbons
style--herbs. "Such as I need, such
as I get," she says matter-of-factly.
"Rabbit tobacco is good for a cold;
sasafras and pine tree tops mixed
with lemon to make tea will tear up 
a cold.  And for a coughin' cold, you
take rosin from the pine beat up 
with brown sugar for tea and that'll
lick it."
Bessie's good health has kept
her singing without interruption
since she was an only child in Dawson,
where she helped her parents
sharecrop and on the family plot
picked cotton, cane, potatoes and
peanuts.  In the fields, they would
sing--songs handed down to her
parents from their parents who
worked the fields as slaves--and
later play "games," entertainment
that didn't cost a cent.
Some songs and games began in
curious ways. "Juba," for example,
