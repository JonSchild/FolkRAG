Dear Mr. Lomax:
      You remember that we have corresponded 
for a number of years without being
able to make any satisfactory conclusion concerning 
a program of American ballads for
the Contributors' Club at the University of
Maine.
      The Club is now doing some preliminary 
thinking with regard to 1940-1941,
and I am writing to ask whether Alan would be
interested in visiting Orono for a fee of $100,
provided that arrangements could be made for
engagements at the other Maine colleges.
      I hope that all is going well
with you.
Very sincerely yours,
Milton Ellis
