Dear Alan:
I had luncheon today with someone who has been recently at several
New England square dances, and he was so enthused that I feel we
will have to try to find some way to record a set.
He is under the impression that the recent interest in these dances
has grown out of their recreation in New England and that the style
which they are using is the type which would appeal to the country
in general.
In yesterday's mail I received a letter from Steubenville, Ohio,
requesting square dance records. The writer suggests Billy Foster's
Orchestra. He indicates that they want records without calls. However,
all the dances they are doing in New England are with calls.
In a recent letter, you remarked that you had a line on talent to do
recording of this sort; therefore, I have several questions to ask
you. How many musicians are necessary? Are they located in or near
New York City? Should we work out a plan to record them, would you be
willing in assisting us in selecting the material, helping supervise the
recording, and preparing the booklet, accept a cent a record royalty?
Let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.
The friend with whom I lunched today said that Sammy Spring from Otis,
Massachusetts, seems to be the leader of the square dance band in
greatest demand throughout New England. Have you heard of him?
Very sincerely yours,
R.P.  Wetherald
