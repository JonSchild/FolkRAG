Another factory worker in Denver on August 12, made the
statement, "I wonder how much money actually reaches the Government
to be used in prosecution of the war effort from the purchase
of bonds? In my opinion if other companies are handling this
matter like the one that I'm working for I doubt if I want to buy
these bonds for the reason that our company seems to keep the money
on hand in the safe for a long time and I understand that the banks
are keeping it on hand for quite a long while and there is a 
question in my mind as to just when the Government actually 
gets this money so they can use it." 8-12 24
