same thing! I am not passing
idle complaints to you. All
along I have been looking forward
to your Negro programs and
I am disappointed that you are
giving up the type that you
can most truly represent.
Lead Belly at his best, in rags and 
stripes, singing for his freedom,
topped them all. I do not know
what New York has done for
him.
Lovingly always,
Father.
