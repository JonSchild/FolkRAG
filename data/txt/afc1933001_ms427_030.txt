YOUTH
(Manuscript)

(Obtainable Affiliated S chools for Workers, Price 5¢)

Myths of the past
Have love their power,
Time flying fast
Brings a new hour.
Nations despairing
Need a new creed,
Seeking and sharing
Youth, youth must lead.


WE SHALL BE FREE

(Manuscript - Obtainable from
Affiliated Schools for Workers - 5¢)

We shall be free
When we understand
The strength, the power
The glorious hour
That lies in our hand.
That hour will come
With our unity
We'll make the machines that enslaved us
Obey us.
We're free!


HYMN TO WORLD UNITY
(Bach Choral)

To all the nations now we call,
An international world to praise,
That we may make all people free,
Our plea for unity we raise.

We are all one, united here,
Though claiming many lands by birth.
Clear understanding now we seek
With all the nations of the earth.


MISTRESS SHADY

Oh Mistress Shady, She is a lady,
She has a daughter whom I adore....
Each day I court her....I mean the daughter,
Ev'ry Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Afternoon at half past four.
