ploy Spanish Loyalist refugees, but
the old policies which have proven
so disastrous to the cause of democracy 
are still followed.

It is true that the French authorities
admit that some 16,000 Spanish
refugees are now employed in agriculture
or industry in France and that
24,500 are engaged in public works
projects. There was hope throughout
this past summer that a real program
of absorption of the refugees into
French economic life would be followed
by the French Government,
but the outbreak of the war has, for
the time being at least, completely
stopped any such effort. And the conditions
of those refugees who are at
present employed in France are
scarcely better than those of Spaniards
who work in Franco's forced-
labor gangs. Living under military
control, separated from their families,
existing on the skimpy war-time
diet and with most of their wages
taken by the French authorities in
payment of their own maintenance,
the total of 40,500 refugees admitted
by the French to be employed, may
well ask themselves if they would not 
be better off in the concentration
camps.

If this is doubted, the following
service order posted on the bulletin-board
at the camp of Gurs on August
13th, in other words before the
war and its undoubted strain on
French economic and political life
began, will perhaps indicate the situation
of these men.

Gurs Camp        August 13, 1939

SERVICE ORDER
TO BE POSTED IN ALL SPANISH
SECTIONS AND WORK GROUPS

1. In order to enjoy the right of asylum
in France, the Spanish refugees
will be submitted to the oaths
established in the decree law of
April 12, 1939.

These oaths consist, for the most
part, in defining work periods under
military authority, and their
duration is the same as that of
military service imposed on
Frenchmen, that is TWO YEARS.
Necessary legal provisions will be
brought to the attention of all
Spaniards in the camp to permit
them to choose, with full knowledge
of the facts, the wisest decision
to take as to what they wish
done about themselves.

2. By the 20th of August of this year,
the commanders of the "ilots"
will draw up and send to me,

through the military officers of
the camp, a full list of the Spaniards
who volunteer to enter into
work units to be employed on
French territory. Mention should
also be made of the profession of
each of the parties involved.

These volunteers must be only
those refugees who desire to remain
in France, thus asking for
themselves the right of asylum.

3. The attention of Spanish refugees
is drawn to the special regime of
the Work Groups. These are run
on less strict lines than the camps.
Moreover, food will be apportioned
and daily allowances (for
tobacco) as bonuses for good
work will be given. The men of
these companies will enjoy a certain
amount of liberty (the possibility

of receiving permission to 
go to see their families, permission
to go out in the evening after
supper, etc.). This regime can
only improve with time.

What immediate alternatives exist
for the refugees? Obviously it will
be some time before adequate arrangements
can be made for the continuation
of mass immigration to
Latin-American and other countries,
such as was planned before the outbreak
of the present war in Europe.
It is equally certain that any normal
absorption into French economic
life will not be forthcoming immediately.
While, therefore, a program
embodying these two factors should
