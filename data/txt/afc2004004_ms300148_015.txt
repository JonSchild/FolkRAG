My Alan Lomax,
Dear Sir.
I'm writing you in Regarding
our Record Business
in which it has been some time
since I have heard from you.
I thought I would write you 
and see just how you are
getting along with the songs
I sure do hope you can get the
Records started moving real soon
there are many people expecting
to hear the Records on the
air I'm expecting that publishers
contract, and my wife is looking for
the Records you promised her
I hope to hear from you real soon
and some good news too after we
hear from you we probly will
fill a tape and send it to you
for Audition By My Brother and I,
so you please write and tell if the 
songs will be Recorded and Released
or not, hoping you all the Best of 
luck
Yours trulay
Mr Spence Moore
