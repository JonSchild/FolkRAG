Mr. John A. Lomax,
Honorary Curator of the Archives
of American Folk Song,
The Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The Department of Art Education of the National Education Associa-
tion will hold its winter convention, Feb. 26-27, at St. Louis,
Missouri. Our Department is a national group of serious art edu-
cators at all levels of instruction. While our chief interest is
art education in general and the raising of the standards of art
instruction in specific, so that they will be a vital and integral
part of our educative process, we are greatly interested in all
the fine arts and their development and appreciation. As a De-
partment, as you are doubtless aware, we are part of the largest
educational body in America, namely, the National Education Associa-
tion.

At this time I am organizing the program of our convention in St.
Louis. The general theme of the convention is "Art Education To-
day and Tomorrow."

As America's noted student of America Folk songs, I want to ex-
tend to you an invitation to be one of our banquet speakers and
singers, on the evening of Monday, Feb 26, 1940, at the Coronado
Hotel, St. Louis, Missouri. As for a subject, I naturally have in
mind "American Folk Songs". We would be greatly honored to have
you discuss this topic, say, for a half hour, and for another
half either to sing various types of our folk songs or to play re-
cords of them, or both. This would be a source of great interest
to us, you may be certain. I may explain that at our Cleveland
convention, we had the modern dance discussed and demonstrated for
us, and at San Francisco, we had the inter-relations of music and
art considered. Your topic would be completely appropriate.

I wish to explain that as a Department of the N. E. A. and since
are solely a professional education group, we are not allowed to
pay speakers, nor do we have such funds. Perhaps your plans might
include such a trip.
