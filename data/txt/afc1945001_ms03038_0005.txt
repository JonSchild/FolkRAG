1. How are we going to control inflation if the wages on jobs at
Fort Harrison, and not only there, but all over the country, are not
frozen. This is a disgrace to our form of government. Both of my

too, but I wouldn't have it. (Prominent local attorney)

1. The local OPA set-up is a big flop. The Administrator's hands are
tied and he can't even hire his own personnel. Any of his recommendations
or appointments have to be approved by the (Governor) Ford-Wheeler set-up,
and so far I understand they have black-balled anything he suggests. Two
of the attorneys appointed to the legal department have never earned
more than $200.00 a month in their lives, and on receives $1,300.pp and
another $400.00 a year more than our own State Attorney General. I also
talked to another attorney on the staff, and he told me that unless the
point in question is absolutely obvious, they were not to construe or
give out any interpretations, but refer to Denver or Washington.
Look at that, employing three attorneys to do what work would keep one
attorney busy about half time, and at that they can't give out any interpretation that isn't absolutely obvious without advice from Washington
or Denver. (Told to me by a local attorney)
