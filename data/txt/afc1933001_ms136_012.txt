Dear Alan:
Your letter which arrived yesterday contained even better news
about the Fair than you imagine. I returned a week ago Wednesday, a
day or two after you left, and found awaiting me a letter from Olin
Downes. He enclosed a copy of a written report by Krimsky about the
outline I brought to New York. In this report, Krimsky said that it
was clear that you knew your stuff but added that they already
done somethings along the line of your suggestions. Downes took
this to mean that they would have no need for you and seemed terribly
discouraged. I shot a letter back to him taking the exact opposite
point of view and maintained that Krimsky's report was encouraging to
say the least. (I think Downes is disappointed to see the project go
out of his department.) Now I find that you were in New York proving
my contentions at the time my letter arrived! I agree with you that
we should await further developments before taking further steps.

I also asked Downes to make informal inquires about my other 
plans for possible official cooperation with his department. This
will not conflict with any personal arrangements you may make - but
more about this later.

In case the Fair people want you to come back in September, wire
me immediately. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. After all,
you have been authorized for a two months trip and the time may be almost
up when the question arises. If nothing happens along these lines
and the trip should prove successful (as usual) we may be able to extend
it.

I shall await your father's return before doing anything about the
ballad book.
