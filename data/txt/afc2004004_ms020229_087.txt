(ABOUT THE DEVIL STORY)
     So that's just a great text, ya know, if ya understand it.
Ya see?  How the devil can temp' ya, an' git ya into tribulations?
But ya got ta put sumpin' between you an' him.
AL:  Where did you learn that story?
BJ:  I learnt that when I was a little chile.  When, when, when,
Aunt Marg'ret an' Miz Carter used to set down an' talk with us,
you know.  That's my grandmother's first cousin, Aunt
Marg'et is.  An' I call 'er Auntie.  Hah, an' so, anyhow, they
used to set down an' talk that.  Then they'd talk it 'bout how
dey, you know.  An' my grandmother'd, too, talk wit' me.  They
talk about how -- Aunt Marg'ret, the firs' night I ever heard
her say it, an' tell it, ya know, that was my grandmother's
firs' cousin.  She was won'erful.
AL:  How old was she?
BJ:  She was oold lady; she walk wit' a stick, then.  I don' know
how old she was.  Walked bent over.  Stayed in a house with long steps
to it.  We used to go there an' stay, ya know, sometimes when I
don't be to Uncle Seeko's place in town, I stay to Aunt Marg'ret.
An', mos' a the time I be to Uncle Seeko, but when a big show
be in town, I stay to Aunt Marg'ret.  Right 'long side a the
street.  Right on Waln -- Broad Street there in, in Dawson.  That
was when I was little.
AL:  Did it scare you when you heard this story?
BJ:  Oh!!  Ya know it did!  I -- ooow, it scared me so bad!  An'
I tell the chilren 'bout it, ya know?  Oow, that ol' buggy turn
in to a, to a, a road cart an' a hoss turned to a grasshopper.
An' he done got them horns an' he done turnt red an' lookin'
at her, rollin' 'is big eyes!  Oh, I seen it so much.  An' I
seen it so much, I'll never forgit the story, ya know.
