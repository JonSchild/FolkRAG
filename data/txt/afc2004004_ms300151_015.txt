Dear Almeda:

I have a profound apology to make to you. The songs in
the Prestige album were not copyrighted due to a mistake
of my agent. I think that you are protected so far by
the copyright notice on the songs, but this explains
why Prestige has never sent you any royalties. They
were never notified by my agent properly to send them.
We are now in negotiations to see whether they can be
induced to do this.

Your Atlantic material has been transferred by Atlantic
to a company called Hill & Range, which is vast and
powerful. I have written them a couple of times and
now my agent is calling them to get a reply.
You have some money coming to you from them according
to the sales figures.

I would feel worse about all this, my dear friend, if
I were not sure that these records will become extremely
valuable and popular some time within the next few years.
They can't be bettered, and when the country wakes up
to high quality folk music, they will begin to sell
steadily as my albums on Columbia are now doing. It
took them about ten years to catch on.

It's wonderful news that you have gone on to make your
own album for Vanguard, and I am proud that I had some
part in introducing you to the world of folk song.

Yours with love,

Alan Lomax
