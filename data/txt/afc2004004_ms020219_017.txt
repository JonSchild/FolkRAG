[*"BRER RABBIT & THE TREES"*]
         He was ah, goin' through the woods an' he wanted to res'.
An' ah, he was won'erin' -- it was so hot, he [wan'ed] didn' know where to res' at.
[there.] He jus' tipped about an' looked, an' so he 'cided he get
un'neath a great big shade tree an' rest.   He got un'neath this
big, great big, ol' shad[d]y tree; it was so pretty.   An' he looked
up there, a thought come to 'im that he supposed to be wise.   Not
foolish.   An' so he [said] say, he git down on his knees to this, this
live tree.   "There's no tellin' what in the worl' this thing will
do. [This] He, 'live! Like you."
         So he tipped on out from there an' went 'way over across the
field an' he saw this ol' dead tree where the limb was stickin'
out, big ol' limb was out there an' it had a good shade to it.
So he got un'neath that an' [it an] he [standin' ov' there,] went to noddin'. He'd
nod an' he'd nod.   So finally the wind was blowin' good. An'
there's an old limb on there, above that, a little weak, an' it
fell off.   Struck him right 'side the head.   Hit the rabbit aside
the head, when that old limb fell off [the] that dead tree!   Hit him 
right 'side the head.
         He broke an' run.  He said, "There, bless God, it don't do
to trus' [tree] dead nor livin'!"  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  [got un'neath the]
         Couldn't [trust] get un'neath the livin' tree; couldn't trust that.  He
wouldn't trust dead nor livin'.  That jus a joke [goin' --] about 'im
goin' - What he do.

[*"BRER RABBIT IN BRER FOX'S GARDEN"*]

about...No...About the...Where the, the rabbit ah, was ah, was

[Then] Every day he'd go up there an' fool the lil' girl, that was [Brer] Bro' Fox'
daughters.  He'd fool them about the, about the green pea...
about the garden.   So the lil' girl let him in the garden.   You
