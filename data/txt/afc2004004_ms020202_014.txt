This is the report from my work in Coweata County. When you read this
I; hope you willlunderstand some of the problems that the people have
down here [deep in the heart of Dixie. First, I will give you some of the names
of the counties that I have cvocered]. Most of the counties [them] are very small. You have
to look hard to find them on the map, but there are peoples there and very
fine people - some old, and some young. some have went and some have come,
some I remember and some I forgot. In all of these places there are more
Negros than White. The towns are owned and operated by white. Maybe a few
white men in each town own the whole town. Only one person in the 
Negro families ever get a chance to vote. Beleive me that I have
learned a .lot from the people. They liked what I came in there to do.

I contacted the right hand Negro of Coweata before I left the island and
told him all of mu ideals, about what I was coming there for. So his work
was that he was glad to have someone there to wake up the people. He drives
the Negro school bus in Coweata County. Pwople were real helpful everywhere.
Haralson was wherewe were located. These are the name f the places that
I went into to find the ones I was looking for. Senoia, Allerton,
Woodberry, Namchester, Newman, Franklen, Molin, Hampton, and
Gay Geor g ia. On

On Griday Aftenrnon, March 25 we got together a group of people that
sing notes. All of them came from different towns. They also will
get together the second sunday in June at Gay. the third sunday In Oct at
Senioa and have what they call a singing Society. They have never
had a gatherin gin Haralson so I am arranging it so they can.
