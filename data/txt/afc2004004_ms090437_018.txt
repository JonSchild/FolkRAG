What are you tryin to do."
"I'm tryin to carry six rows
And my chillun all carryin two"

I thought I buried you in the sand?"
I be back next [year] spring
When you spadin' up yo land.

"How come yo' head red?---"
"Eatin' all the farmer's cotton,
But he tryin' to kill me dead."

For to git his wife a dress.
Boll weevil says "Now farmer,

                  -----------
Then the farmer went to the merchant then,
For some dippin & chewin'
