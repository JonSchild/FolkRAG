GARY: some ham for eating. My grandmother always was 
the type to ask for things. She says Miss Lollie give me a 
piece of that ham. She says what? Who ever heard of a 
nigger eating ham. How many clothes you got washed out there.
Get you some butter and molasses. She did the wash for that
woman. She says how many clothes you got washed out
there, I tell you, I let you go home. Made the white woman
mad you understand. Cause she asked her for a piece of ham.
LARRY: Did you hear that Lionel?
LIONEL: Yeah.
Larry: Isn't that something. I'm telling you.
GARY: Get you some butter and molasses.
LARRY: She said, WHAT. the very idea.
GARY:Who ever heard of a Negro woman eating ham.
(LAUGHTER) I tell you what happened to me one time. One time I was coming down the street playing guitar.
An old white fellow was sitting out there on his porch. Hey,
stop here and play me and my family a tune. I stopped. I said
you mind give me one of them cigarrettes? He say, Why, does
a nigger [xx] smoke cigarrettes? So I said, Hell yes, I smoke 
cigarrettes. Well you won't get no damn cigarettes from me.
