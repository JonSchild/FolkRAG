(END OF RECORD)
I was a great church man.  That was when I was 'round 19 yrs. old.
('Course that's been a long time, we won't go into that.)  But that 'as,
that-uh I quit the church, 'cause I wasn't-uh-wasn't no way for me to
collect no salary from-uh what I was doing in the church, to make a living.
So I had to go to the farm, work on the plantation, raise cotton 'n corn,
potatoes an' stuff like that to make a livin'. . .So one day I was-uh
called, uh-was axed, could I play a fiddle.  An' I told 'im, "Yes, I
could play a fiddle".  So the-the guy told me he'd give me fifty dollars
to play the fiddle for the dance that night.
