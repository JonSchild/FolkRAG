wouldn't know what the factor is. He comes to collect half
your rents in the country.) She says, "John, the Factor'll
be here today, and his money's there, and you don't give him
the money, but tell him to wait till I come back. I won't be
long. And keep on a big fire."
     And this poor thing was all the company and all that his
mother had. Well, she went away and he was left for an hour or
two by himself. But the factor comes looking for his mother.
The factor says, "Is your mother in, John?/"
And he says, "Naw, my mother's nae in." (That's the way the
country people speaks.) Andthe factor says, "Well, well, I'll
come in."
"Well, come in a while until my mother gets back then. Sit
doon."
      So, of course, the factor was very tired and cold andthere
was a big fire on, a big peat fire, you see - he sits down. And
John sits down. So he sits down and speaks to the factor, till
the factor gets overcome by the heat of the peat fire and falls
asleep. So John was sitting and looking at the sleeping factor,
and suddenly a flea appears on the factor's head - he was
balding. And this fascinated the poor creature, being a bit
simple. And he watched this flea and he watches this flea. And
the more he watched it the more it was fascinating him. But
he says to the flea, him not being right in his normal senses,
nd the poor factor, he was soundly sleeping, he didna know this
was going on, he was that tired. John says, "Come off the
laird's brow, man."/
     'Course, the flea wouldna hear him. "Come off the laird's
brow, man." - But he never come off. But there was a great big
a xe beside him. The axe was for hacking sticks. So this poor
silly creature, he pivks up the axe. "Come off the laird's brow.
Ye willna come off? But ye will! I'll mak' ye come off!" And
the first stroke he lands upon the brow he kills him stone dead.
     So in comes his mother. So when she saw what happened, well,
nturally, all she had was her son, and she would try to save her
son from get tooken away. So the only thing she could do. . . They
had a big billy-goat - its name was the factor, and the
mother went up and killed the goat. So she says, "Come on, John,"
she says, "And help me bury the factor." So he went up and the 
two of them buried the goat. Aye, but then again, you see, he had
to help his mother bury the real factor, the man! So they
buried him a different grave. But one way and another when
he was sleeping, his mother went up and opened the grave where
the billygoat was, and opened the grave up where the man was
buried, and took the man out and put him in the grave where the
goat was. So she disposed of the man in other ways, and puts
the goat in the grave. . . .
     So she goes home and tellt him to look up at the lamp. She
made a pot of porage and milk, and she emptied it down the lamp.
and of course, the poor creature, he looks up at the lamp and
he was gobbling this milk and porage as it come down the lamp.
