Toasts - E. George
Here's hopin you'll live to the
good old [days] age of Adam
and of Eve and your hair
grows long as rake-stales
and drags upon the ground
and in the rising generation 
the folks'll look out of the 
window & say "Who in the 
Hell goes there?"

Here's to the [higher] tallest tree that ever grew
the [fastest] highest bird that ever flew
The swiftest horse that ever run
The fatter the lady the better 
the fun
