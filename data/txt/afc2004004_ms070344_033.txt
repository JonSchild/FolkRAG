grey lake with turfed olive islands,
the trees small green brooms.  The
day is wet & cold - we are driving 
through a cloud, really.  Robin, 
Robin! Lord have mercy on me.

Jan 25th evening - Lovely Tralee - the best steals in Ireland
- the cathedral in the center of town with
a high brown and white tiled tower at
the center and low crouching naves
at the side - two wet grey
doves crouching beside a brown crane - 
like Venice.

Nobody in any gas station st
3 in the evening.  So we waited
and ate the usual lavish steals
with chips, peas, stout coffee & 
dessert.  As the angels bell rang
I looked down the shadowy street
and saw a crowd pouring into the
gateway of the cathedral - no noise
of footsteps, no conversation, the
women hooded against the damp
