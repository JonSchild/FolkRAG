Anecdote
A draftie for the first time was 
walking across the street when he pasted
a Colonel. Instead of standing at attention
 and saluting, he just looked at
him and pasted him by. The Colonel
called out "Hey, Private! Can't you see
what I'm wearing? The Private turned
around and said, "What are you squawking
about, look what they gave me.
