Livingston, Ala.
5/26/1939.

Dear Mr. Spivacke:

1. I am writing today asking
the Washington Express Office
to release the records. It must have
looked to you like an attempted
hold-up.

2. My blank records are
here waiting for me, having been 
forwarded fro Merrivale, La.
My brain got skitting from
too much fast travelling and I
had to get a check-up from
you. My apologies to you for
both slips.
