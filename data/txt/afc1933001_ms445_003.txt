   "This 'lying-song' is widely distributed in the British 
Isles and America. For English and American references see a 
note by G.L. Kittredge, p 173 of the article by Hudson, "Notes 
on a Lying-Song,' JAFL, XXX1X.  Phillips Barry, 'Some Traditional 
Songs,' JAFLX VIII, 51-54, mentions the tradition that George 
Washington sang this song to the children of Chief Justice 
Ellsworth (see Michigan B). Ford (First Series, 18 99) , p. 125, 
suggests that the song was composed in the time of the feudal laws 
by a prisoner who had been condemned to death and who was promised 
a pardon should he compose a song without a grain of truth in it.
