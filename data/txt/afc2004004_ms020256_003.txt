[*STORY OF PINKEY MELTON HEXED, CONT., T. 41*]

BJ:   Went down there in the woods an' meet me then on a, the
tracks, by, at least, me an' Leona.  An' we got this stuff.
Now, Pinkey down the railroad track gittin' her, ah, wood, her
an' the res' a the chillun, an', [kiow] know?  You know, that
thing hurt me so bad.  When I got to the house -- I brought this
the stuff to the house with Topin Melton (?).  I said, "I'm
[gonna] goin' ta take this stuff here an' ah, make it up."  I said, "But
I'm scared to go to Pinkey."  I said, "I want you to make a
belt of it, you know, an' put it on 'er."  Ya see. 'Cause [(if)]
it's devil, devil witches' weed, I, I'm gonna see.  I'm gonna
see what will it do.  I say, "I don' know what it do." I 
said,"But I'm gonna, I'm gonna make a belt a it."

She say, "Bessie," say, "You make a belt," say, "I'll git
it on 'er." Say [Be]"Cause when she take a least nap tonight, I'll jus'
go there an' put it on 'er."

 All right. So they slep' in the same room.  I said, "All
right. Then make some an' boil it, ya know, an' let 'er," an'
you know, "jus Let 'er jus' wash off in some of it," ya know.  Try
to keep them things from worryin' 'er so she jus' hagged to
death.  She looked like the devil 'cause she couldn't sleep, you
know, hardly.  You know. As, up all through the night an' that
fight...She stan' bare face an' just cuss do all
She had a ugly face.  Just cuss.  An' call things "mugkups."  I never
heard of such a name -- mugkups. 
TL:    Call things...?
BJ:    Yeah.
TL:    Mullcups?
BJ:    Yeah. Never heard a such a thing. Yeah.
TL:    She called things that?
