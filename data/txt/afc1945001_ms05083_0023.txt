August 3: In a barber shop I heard the barber talking to
a captain of the air corps. The barber stated
that he had heard of a soldier in the air corps who was
transferred from some place in Texas to Lowry, California
and because of the red tape in the Army, it took the soldier
a month to be sent to Lowry Field, Colorado. The air corps
captain replied, "That is a mistake which is made frequently
because of the abbreviations for the states of California
and Colorado." Denver [*(37)*]
