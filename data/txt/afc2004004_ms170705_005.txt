town at the present time - and that fellows called Adams. Now
when the hobby horse come into the town and saw he, he'd run
miles! Yet he's a born and bred Minehead man. He'd still run!
He'd run like made from the hobby horse, and we've seen it many
years.
Lomax: Why does he run from it?
Alf: They used to play trivks on him years ago, and he hadn't
forgot it. And he'll go -- he will go -- There's no doubt about
that.
Boy: How heavy is the hobby horse?
Alf: Well, it isn't as heavy as the old one was, because the
simple reason for why is this. The old one was replaced by sticks
all the time. If he was broken, instead of taking him completely
to pieces, they'd add a piece on him. Well, I made this one last
year - it's all new sticks. And new sticks take a certain amount
of time to dry because they're green when you cut them. But
they're not supposed to be cut green, -- supposed to be cut when
the sap's out of them because in the making of the hobby horse
a  certain class of stcisk - the withy or an holly, because they've
got no center sap. So that when he's dried out properly, you got
a complete stick and you can bend them. Then those sticks should
be put inplace nearly nine months before you make the hobby horse
and steamed. If you didn't, and you had a stip with sap in it,
it's snap. He must be like a cane that'll buckle and  twist . . . . . .
(He then goes on to describe making of a hobby horse, but it's
very muddled. . . .)
