3974 - Uncle Billy McCrea
Uncle billy was head caller
at log rollings in East Texas.
and was the best songster,
according to his own story.
He followed dancing about 60 years
and "I'm a [for] good footman right
now.  I can do ev'ry kind of
dancing - back step, shuffling,
dance on my head or on my toes.
They sent for me for ev'ry party
in de community[?] to call [dances]
squares[?] for them."



UNCLE BILLY MCCRAE* Jasper, Texas

Excerpt from RTL letter to family:- Oct.14

Did I write you about Uncle Billy, allegedly 117
years old, ex-slave.  He can't enunciate very well,
what with all but two tusk-teeth gone, but there's
plenty of life in the old fellow.  Dr.Jim ought to
meet him; might get some ideas for some of his patients.
Uncle Bill[t]y has a recipe for a bull-nettle tonic,got
from an Indian;guaranteed to restore lost manhood.

He showed John Avery his bottle. "I takes two doses
ev'y two [we] weeks."
