WE'LL NOT BE FOOLS ANY MORE

(Tune: "When Johnny comes marching home"
Page 173 - Old Favorite Songs.)

The battle is on that none can shirk in field or street,
The lines are drawn twixt those who work and those who eat,
Oh, we are many and they are few
Yet we've always done what they told us to
But the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more;
yes, the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more.

Oh, how do they hold the upper hand? The answer runs
They got the gold and they got the land and they got the guns,
"Divide and conquer us" was the trick,
By the gift of gab and the hired dick,
But the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more;
Yes, the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more.

Oh, mighty theengines, rich the fields, from coast to coast,
The spped of our toil, the wealth it yields, is all earth's boast.
And our are the hands on those machines,
Now think for a minute just what that means,
That the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more,
Yes, the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more.

To feed and shelter and clothe the earth, is a simple job,
If once the spirit of Man takes birth, from formless mob,
If from the mills and mines, and huts
We organize, and use our nuts,
Then the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more,
Yes, the time has come when
We'll not be fools any more.
