Sophomore White Female

1. There was a girl that worked at Wright's
and she carried her lunch with her. She
put an apple in one of her pockets and
an orange in her other side pocket; then
she put a banana in her hip pocket. The
girl caught a street car so she could get to
work. When she felt in her two pockets 
her apple and orange were gone so she said "
well I'll just hold on to my banana, so
it wont disappear.
