Extracts from "A collection of Valuable Sermons" by Eminent
Divines in the last 2 centuries: pub. Marcus MacDonald 1814
p. 362:
Whilst thou diest, thou shalt be a damned creature. Whilst thou
livest thou art fed like a beast by common providence and are
a mere stranger to feeding promises. If thou lookest upwards,
God is frowning, and his wrath is revealed from heaven against
thee. If thou lookest downwards, thou mayest see hell gaping
and opening its mouth to swallow thee up quick; many dangers
attend thee every day. Many miseries ever moment; legions
of the devils stand about thee, watching thee, and waiting for
the leave of God to drag thy soul into the lake of fire.
Ah, when thou diest, man, what must thou then do? When
captain death strikes his armies of wolves will fall upon thee.
Look to it and remember thou wert once warned lest thou die
eternally. St. Austin's prayer was "Oh Lord, rack me. hew me, burn
me here but spare me hereafter." As long as thou refusest to
hear Christ's voice thou hast a hell upon earth; it is not the
multitude of companions that go thither which any whit lessen
thy torments but rather encrease them; thy life, that have been
full of worldly joys, shall end in daily woe.
All you, into whose hands this little book shall come, Oh let me
beg you to consider, in those bowels of love you have to put
your own souls how your hearts can endure to think
of being that out of heaven, out of blessedness for ever; ask
your heart these questions: Can I burn? Can I endure the
vengeance/
