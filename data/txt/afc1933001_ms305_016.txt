Lomax to Review
(continued from page one)
trasting the fast, driving songs of
the railroad camp with the slow,
moaning songs of the levee camp
with its mules getting stubborn
under the hot sun and "writing
their initials on the mules behind
them."

Traces Negro Ballad.
The story of mutes and brushes
for trumpets and drums developing
from the yearning of the Negro
for new effects from his musical
instruments was another part of
Mr. Lomax's lecture.  He also
traced the development of the Negro
ballad out of the Anglo-Saxon
originals.
His  audience again caught itself
quietly stamping in time to Mr.
Lomax's voice as he sang the ballad
of "Lazarus" and his execution
for stealing the "commissary" store
payroll.
Besides samples of the Negro
songs with which  he excited his
Tuesday night audience, Mr.Lomax
will  present in his recital tonight
songs from almost every
corner of American life, from the
hill country of the Kentucky 'feuders"
to the prairie lands of the
Western cowboy, and from Southern
Indiana to the homes of the
Georgia "crackers."
