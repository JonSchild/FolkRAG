MRS. DAVIS:
Well its on this hill, and in the newspapers its called Sandhill and its way out in ---------- New Jersey not to far from Lenox Hill New Jersey, I went out there Saturday and Jimmy came along there, he's taking me there, you konw I started getting cold cause its an air conditioned car and I don't like an air conditioned car. Jimmy keep telling me if its too cool let us know, but when you riding in somebody's care you don't like,
you don't want to make excuses. I taken a cold from that air conditioned car, but its a nice little lovely place. John was saying to me yesterday that Rev. Davis said If I get better, I'm going out there and making a guest house. We have it together, a guest house. John say I have a little money so long as you you could make a guest house put up a barbeque in the back outside you know. I didn't say nothing, it was too far. He going to get it fixed up and I think he's going to really bring to fall and going to sell it.
