Dear Mr. Lomax:
     Moses Smith has referred to me his recent
correspondence with you concerning the rights
claimed by your father in certain of the folk
songs recorded by Burl Ives on Okeh records. I 
sincerely regret that you considered my letter
to your dad, which was written in the regular 
course of my duties here, as unfriendly. I have
heard the name Lomax mentioned by various executives 
of this organization on many occasions in
the most friendly way.
   The correspondence indicates that there
are two possible bases upon which your father
might claim rights in the situation, either upon
a legal basis or a moral basis. As to the former,
it is my sincere opinion that there are no 
legal rights in the collector of music which is
in the public domain. Furthermore, it has always
been my understanding that your dad has endeavored
to collect the music in as authentic a manner as
possible without the addition of new arrangements,
etc.
     As to the matter of moral commitment, it
seems to me that this is a matter between you 
and Burl Ives. Promptly upon receipt of your 
dad's letter, I had an interview with Burl Ives.
At that time, he expressly negated any commitment
whatsoever to either you or your dad.
      Apart from any legal consideration, therefore,
there seems to be certain conflicting facts
to be reconciled. It is my suggestion that, upon

[*You wrote me that Ives told you 
that he had telephoned Columbia to arrange 
with us to use the songs.*]
