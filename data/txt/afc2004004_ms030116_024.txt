(HE ISN'T READY YET AND WE TURN OFF MACHINE)

Eliz:  What do you mean when you say God has laid his hands on you?
Rev. D:  I mean He nointed me fur to preach the Gospel.  Thass what I mean.
Eliz:  Did you ever feel that in any absolute literal kind of way -- that
God laid a hand on you?  Or is it just a manner of speaking?
Rev. D:  I'm speakin bout what I know.
Eliz:  How do you know i t, Rev. D?
Rev. D:  Well, by my fruit.  Thass right.  Many souls have been saved under
my preachin.  That's the onliest way anybody will ever know wh at God
has done fur you:  By your fruit.  If a tree don't bring forth no fr uit
there's nothin you can git from th at tree.  Can you?
Eliz:  No.  That's true.
Rev. D:  Must bring fruits of some kind.  It's a plum tree must bear some
plums.  Ain't that right?
Eliz;  Mmmm-hmmm.
Rev D; (not satisfied with this lazy response) Uh?
Eliz:  (still lazy) Yeah.
Rev. Davis:  Thass right!  Come on!  Must bear some plums!  Every vine --
not only tree -- but every vine got to bear the fruit of its kind.
If it's any kind of vine that's not dead.  The Scripture say "Every vine
th at don't bear fruit should be cut down an burned by unquenchable
fir e."  Thass right!  Thass the reason I know that God has laid a hand
on m e to preach the gospel because I know it by my fruit.
I cannot number the people that have been converted under me since I
been preachin the gospel.  An that's what makes me feel mighty good.
. . .Some time I would to God that my wife know me:  But she don't know
me.  The whole ten yeahs I have been takin care of huh she don't know m e
yet.  (This is a strange statement which I do not understand.  I am embarrassed.
Mrs. Davis looks sick.  She says nothing but falls back in
