Words to r. r. songs Houston

Uncle Bud got a daughter, her name is Kate
Got a cut-out of her pussy, like a 
Cadillac 8.

Uncle Bud got gals without no hairs

Yahoo songs - if you sing one of 'em
 around the peckerwoods, you got to
 run --they don't like to have no em - maybe 
if there's just one in the field, he won't mind -
if you want to stay in this country, 
you can't fool with songs like that.
