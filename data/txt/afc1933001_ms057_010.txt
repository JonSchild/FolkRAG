Mr. John A. Lomax
General Delivery
Houston, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Thank you for your letters and please
thank Mrs. Lomax also for her concise
report of your activities. I am sorry that
you had trouble with the machine. We sent it
to be over-hauled and it was returned apparently
in good condition, of course I did not have any
time to test it myself. It is also possible 
that the tubes were broken in shipment. At
any rate, I am glad that it is working again 
and that you are making good records.

I cannot understand why Presto did not
send you the sapphire needles which were included
in the original order. We wired them
and asked them to send it air mail.

I think that I worked our a satisfactory 
formula with the Gamut recording company.
The important thing is for you to make definite
arrangements with the singers whose works are 
to be used commercially. I shall take it up
with the Librarian immediately and expect to
obtain his approval. 

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
