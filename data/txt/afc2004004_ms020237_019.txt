TL: What did he want the stool for when the ham a meat's there?
BJ: He chucked it -- He chuck it at the dawg an' make 'im put
one-laig down...Ya see? The dog came up there an' grabbed that
ham, see? An' run off with it. He jumped up an' grabbed the three-
laigs, throwed the three-laigs at the, at four laigs t' make four-
laigs put one-laig down. Ha, ha. I think that's a-very easy to 
think of, ya know? 'cause it's kind so, so straight: Two laigs
sittin' on three-laigs. Yeah, with one-laig in 'is lap. That is,

ask that thing more times than...YESSIR, ALL THEM kinda thing like that;
it was really funny. "Two-laigs sittin' on three-laigs," hum!

ya see? "Two-up-abouts." Ya git that now? "An' two hook-abouts,"
Ya see? "An' fo' stand-abouts an' one, an' one switch-about."
