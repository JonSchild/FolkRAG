Ask Miss Rogers to look up the address of Kelly Pace, one of the 
singers on the South[?] American set of records, and send said address
to father. He's going to visit Kelly on [?] the next leg of his trip. 
I neglected to say that if I stay in Clarksdale until Wednesday 
of next week I will drive straight on to Washington with only an overnight 
stop in [W??????] Nashville. It seems a pity to do that when I have the 
chance to work a bit with Dr. Jackson and with the head of the music department 
att the University of Kentucky, but I guess it must stay that way. 
My best friend in Texas, Johnny Faulk, who has such physical disabilities(vision) 
that the army won't accept him, has joined the Merchant Marine and will sail
this week out of Galveston. He was my last remaining hope as an active folklorist. 
I guess the thing has died until after the war and of course after the war
the best stuff will be gone in this country. His decision has had a great effect

behind the times as they were when I left town, I am still a bit discouraged. 
Your last letter offers me a number of opportunities for suggesting projects, 
and I shall think them over [b???] I before I come home, but not write them
out until I have time to discuss them with you. Thanks for your letter. 
Regards, 
Alan
