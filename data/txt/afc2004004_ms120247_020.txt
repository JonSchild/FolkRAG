evidently decided that enough Gods had been specifically honored.
The time had come for [xxx] amusement, for local gossip, for
the songs of the Marseille hounfort and the mombo. The songs
that follow, therefore, may all be designated "Point Guinea",
which [xxxxxx] refers to songs of oblique reference that are of the

                  The next is clearly a "point Guinea pour toute loa"
and was sung sufficiently long to be recorded.        A Yen Valou,
