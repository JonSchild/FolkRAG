over the cause of the war was widespread, 
there appeared in England a wave of tales relating
how the English soldiers had been protected
in Battle by supernatural agents, i.e.,
angels, St. George, "ghostly bowmen."  These
shortly disappeared to be replaced by a wave
of rumors telling how the Russians had sent 
vast numbers of troops to aid the British on
the western front.

2. The rumors current at a given time will tend
to follow a common expressive pattern.  Waves of 
wish rumors will follow upon waves of anxiety 
rumors, etc., as public opinion swings from one
extreme to the other.

Example:  Of all the rumors which appeared 
during the first 48 hours of the current war,
only two came to the attention of the writer
which were wishful in affective quality.  The
vast majority were of the anxiety type.  On
the other hand, almost all of the rumors current
in America during the fall of 1939 were 
of the wishful type.

Motivational determinants are our third class.  These 
are the forces exerted by the wishes, hostilities, and 
fears of the people.  They tend to distort the content 
of a rumor toward the expression of these sentiments.
We have already distinguished (a) the wish rumor,
(b) the hostile rumor, (c) the anxiety rumor.  Of the
first two little more need be said.  The anxiety rumor
is, however, not so simple.  Here we have the case in
which people disseminate, without ample evidence, reports
counter to their wishes.  We may indicate possible 
explanations.

a.  They may be expressions of destructive self-punishing
impulses.

Example: In psychopathology, it is not at all
uncommon to find a patient who will deliberately
anticipate the worst.  In common language, he is 
a chronic pessimist.  This is a neurotic pattern
and would appear to account for only an occasional
instance of the anxiety rumor.

b.  It may be that, in a situation of general insecurity,
the definition of the source of danger
has a beneficial effect and positive appeal.

Example:  Given a situation in which the civil
population is threatened by the military action
of the enemy, a rumor that the enemy is actually
approaching may release tension, for then the
