All-Negro Town
To Mark Birthday

        MOUND BAYOU, MISS., (AP)â€”
Mound Bayou is getting dressed
up for its grandest celebration.
        This bustling, all-Negro com-
munity, founded 50 years ago by
ex-slaves, is sparing no effort to
make its birthday party an occa-
sion of which to be proud. 
        Mayor B. A. Green and other
leading citizens are at work o a 
week-long program which begins
Sunday with memorial services in
tribute to the founders. 
Mayor Green, a lawyer, Harvard
graduate and son of one of the
founders, will deliver the me-
morial address. He recently was
elected to his eight consecutive
erm. 
        Monday
Monday's program will bring
Colonel Roscoe Conklin Simmons
of Chicago, Negro author, to
Mound Bayou for the founders'
day address.
        The town, which has no jail and
hasn't had a capital crime in 13
years, will be gay with flags and 
bunting. All week there will be 
barbecues, speechmaking, parades 
and dancing.
        Mound Bayou's citizens claim it
is the only all-Negro community 
in America. Its founders were led
by Isaih T. Montgomery and
Benjamin T. Green. Montgomery,
a former slave of President Jef-
ferson Davis of the Confederacy
was Mound Bayou's first Mayor. 
Green, the father of the present
Mayor, financed the colony at the
founding. 
        One of the town's outstanding
residents is Mary C. Booze, na-
tional Republican committeewom-
an from Mississippi.
        Mound Bayou is located in
Bolivar County in one of the
richest cotton-growing sections of 
the Mississippa delta. The city
proper has a population of ap-
proximately 2,000 and the Mound
Bayou area embraces approxi-
mately 8,000 negroes. 
        The Bolivar Count Training 
School here has an enrollment of 
750 students. The town has six churches
and a kindergarten
