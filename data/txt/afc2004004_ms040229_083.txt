Against the nine paths
" " " tumults
" " " crafty wiles
" nine slender women of fairy
Against the eye of bachelor
" " " of old maid
" " " of old man
" " " of old woman
If it be eye of man
May it flare like pitch
If it be eye of woman
May she want her breast
Flooding? be to her water
And chilling be to her blood
To her cattle to her sheep
To her people to her wealth
--
p.184 Old Highland people believed
that dream caused by "microbes?
small, minute miserable full of sprite
 & mobility"--"marshes,
bacteria, mites, and other animals
--yg people, educated do not believe
in these old lying romances
