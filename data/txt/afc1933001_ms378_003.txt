Rain or Shine
We're alone, dovey gal, in the rain and hail,
Got to drive these dogies down the Trail;
We'll ride the range from sun to sun
For a cowboy's work is never done,
He's up and gone at the break of day
Driving the dogies on their weary way
    ---
A cowboy's life is a dreary thing
For it's rope and brand and ride and sing
For day or night [a night] in the rain or hail
He'll stay with [them] his dogies out on the trail
---
Cho  Its rain or shine, sleet or snow
Me and my dovey gal are on the [go] go
Well travel down that lonesome trail
Where man and his horse seldom 
ever fail

We'll whoop at the sun and yell through the hail
But [As] we drive the poor dogies on down the trail
