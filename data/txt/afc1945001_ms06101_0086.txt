RUMOR REPORT
As suggested by Rumor Directive for BPI, FSA and Correspondence Panel

1. Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 4
"There is no justification for all the expense in maintaining a state agency to promote sales of bonds and stamps. I have been told that the state director's office here has a staff, several of whom receive large salaries. There are thousands of dollars being expended for this purpose that could be used to better advantage. During the last war no such organization was found necessary and the results were highly satisfactory."
