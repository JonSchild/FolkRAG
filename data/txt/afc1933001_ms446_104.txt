CHORUS 

I'm bound for that beautiful city
My Lord has prepared for His own, 
Where all the redeemed of all ages 
Sing, "Glory,"  around the white throne.
Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven, 
And the glories I there shall behold; 
What a joy that will be when my Savior I see
In that beautiful city of gold! 

2 

We'll never pay rent for our mansion, 
The taxes will never come due; 
Our garments will never grow threadbare, 
But always be fadeless and new. 
We'll never be hungry nor thirsty,
Nor languish in poverty there,
For all the rich bounties of heaven, 
His sanctified children will share. 

3 

There'll never be crepe on the door knob, 
No funeral train in the sky. 
No graves on the hillsides of glory, 
For there we shall never more die. 
The old will be young there forever,
Transformed in a moment of time; 
Immortal we'll stand in His likeness,
The stars and the sun to outshine. 

No. 11     Oh!  My Mother 

Since the angels took my mother home to heaven, 
Life has been so very sad and lone to me, 
But I am trusting in the God she loved so well,
And some day my mother's face again I'll see.
