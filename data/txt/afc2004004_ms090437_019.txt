Then the farmer went to the merchant, then,
Gonna get him a basket of lard,
"Can't git nothin', farmer,
Boll weevil got yo' job."
                        -----
Well, the farmer went in his field nex mornin'
Boll weevil flyin' in the air,
Went out there next evenin'
Done moved his fam'ly there.
                         -----
That farmer ax the boll weevil,
"What in the world you tryin' to do?
I'm tryin to carry 6 rows
And my chillun all carryin' two"
                          -----
