His name was Woodward - he was a trombonist.  That's the place that
King Oliver made much fame in the Pacific Coast in.
     So we went along and we made a lot of money together.  Money was
no object.  I had plenty clother, plenty diamonds.  I also came in possession
of a gambling club, next door to the hotel, which was on the corner,
right across from Watts and Burns.  W & B was considered at that time
of the greatest billiard players in the world.  We had become to be very
personal friends and there was a lotta money made in this gambling place.
I had a fellow running the place for me - from New Orleans that had a lotta
confidence in.  He was the first fellow that played the part of Tarzan
in the moving picture a great big black fellow, standing almost 7 feet
high and he must weigh at least 300 pounds, all solid meat.  His name
was Zack Williams.  I trusted Zack to run the dice game for me and, of 
course, Zach was looking out for Zack - he made a lotta money, but,
still and all he always wanted some more money and I ran the club along
and did pretty good until once I taken a trip to Frisco on the train
and I had $2000 bank roll down there that was for him to mostly use for
change and occasionally call a bet when nobody else would call a bet
in order to keep the game goin.  Everything was trusted up to his honesty,
which I found it shouldn't have been because he wasn't trustworthy.  As
a wire reached me before I was to Fresno going towards Frisco -
that the bankroll was lost and I who it was lost to.  It was lost to a 
fellow he palled around with, name Skids.  So, when I came back, I
just got rid of the club.  And that left Zach out in the cold, because
he'd lost his movie job - he was such a big star, he would go to work
anytime he got ready.  So we went along and made a lot of money.  Zack
was a very expensive help to me; every morning he demanded a steak
that would cost a $1.25 raw - (end)
