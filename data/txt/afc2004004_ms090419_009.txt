Old Massa had a nigger named John and he told him, "John,
I been missing hogs every night and the last one I seen in the
pen was you.  I believe you stealing my hogs."

"O no, " says John, " I ain't been stealing your hogs.  Not old
John."

Well, that Saturday night John decided to slip off and take
him a little shoat.  The first shoat he grabbed, Old massa caught 
him at the gate, say, "John, I'm gonna make you eat every damn
bit of this hog, yourself.  You been stealin, now I'm gonna see
you do some eatin."

He had the cook stew that old shoat down in one of these
old wash pots and cook up a big pan of corn bread.  The first
thing old John grabbed was the head, shook it by the ears and et
the head up.  Took the middlins , fold um up just like you do a
flapjack and et them.  Took them there hams, knocked the gristles
off them, et them and then he turned and say,  "Captain, if you'd
give me any more'n this to eat, you'd-a killed me sho!"
