An' turned an' went back town in that devlish place.  Tha's why 
I say I don't work for no party that come from Randolph County, 
'cause I jus', I don't. . .          .   'Course I expect all that crew 
[coulda] died out.
               An' Uncle Gene, after that, ah, killin', then they come an tol' 
Uncle Gene.    Where they'd put 'im.   In that hole.  Right out there in -- I could go to 
that place anytime, now in Cuspeth.   An' Uncle Gene went to the city.  I 
guess there was a lawyer in town, somewhere, an' tol' him about 
it.   See?   [Him an' them] Came in with those same two white boys.  The girl's brothers.  
They [went] was mens.   An' they went over to see about it.   An' make them 
peoples dig 'im up, an' make them peoples get a casket. . .Tha's 
right.   An' him an' these white boys an' the others went an' 
buried 'im.   [An'] Tha's right.  Had wropped 'im  in a buryin sheet,  _______quilted?      buryin' 
sheet. . .
TL:            Well, Bessie, how did he get caught when he got back there?
BJ:             Oh, I heard when he got back there, the dawgs was trailin' 
him, you know, an' then a colored lady -- he was almost back [there] up
to Uncle Gene's -- an' a colored [lady] woman had one a' them __________-- 
what they call bedspreads now, we call 'em counter[pane]pin (counter-
panes). 
She had one a those great, big counterpin on the bed 
when the dawg -- she had it pulled down, an' hid under the bed, 
under her bed, he was hid.   [Because] He tol' 'em he didn' do it; he talked to 
'em an' everything but them dawgs come around anyhow. . .An' so. . .
I talked with [that] a lady, I guess about ten years ago.   She said 
that was her husband's sister, that he was in [her] that house.   She was 
dead then, too.   The lady knowed -- I tol' her why.   I went up to 
Cuspeth to go with a girl to the hospital.   I tol' you I don' like to go there, so I
went with this girl to the hospital, to be treated.   An' so 
I was talkin' to a lady, she say, "Yeah!"   She was glad that I 
was one of 'em, y'know, somebody that know about it.   She say, 
"Yeah!"   She say, "Ya see out on that hill?"   They call it, 
what they call it?  Yeah, the Red Devil Hill; it's a high hill.  
An' she said, "Right there, was it?"   Said, "The pine tree is 
dead now."   An' I said, "But it's still there."   I said I didn't wanna 
see it.  But it's still there.  They got a cross on it. . . So anyway, 
tha's the way it happened. . .
TL:            Do you find that when your family found out. . .?
