"This is a song about little children who are so
hungry all the time they will chew on anything, so they
eat paint that chips off their walls. We found out
about thirty kids died last year in Chicago from eating
illegal lead-based paint. Other children lost
eyesight or suffered brain damage. We got a group of
teen-agers together -- kids from off the block -- and
they began to cover the community taking urine samples
to spot danger in time, and distributing information
about lead poisoning. Then with rallies
they made it a public issue.

"Eventually Mayor Daley put 300 people to work in
the community on the problem, using war-on-poverty
money. Earlier, when this plan had been proposed,
it was turned down." -- Jimmy Collier

CHORUS
Lead poison on the wall,
Kills little guys and little dolls.
It kills 'en big and it kills 'em small,
While we stand by and watch them fall,
And the landlord does a-nothing to stop it all,
That death on the wall,
that death on the wall.
VERSE
There's poison in the paint
enough to make a little child faint
enough to blind his eye,
enough to make him die,
from that lead poison--

There's plaster falling from the ceiling
Plaster falling and plaster peeling,
Doesn't the landlord have any feeling?
Someone's responsible for all that killing
From the lead poison, etc. (Cho)

Urine samples and knockin' on doors
Label of paint in all of the stores
Rally and action and you cannot ignore
There's still children dying, so we've got
to do more on that-- (Cho)

"The Movement's Moving' on'

TUSKEGEE--A traveling group
called the Southern Festival of Song
appeared at Tuskegee Institute last
weekend before Negro and white college
students.

The concert ended with a song that
may symbolize the basic shift in the
attitude of the civil rights movement.

Songfests like this one used to finish
with the stately and patient anthem,
"We Shall Overcome."

Last Friday, a folk singer from
New York City, Len Chandler, said
he had a new civil rights song, to the
tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic"
("Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord"). He
recalled the same tune was used as
"John Brown's Body," and as a
marching hymn in the Civil War, ad
as "Solidarity Forever" in the labor
union movement.

Chandler sang bitterly of "your
jails full of black men" and "your
courts full of white hate," and then
the chorus, "Move on over or we'll
move on over you, For the movement's
movin' on!"

Several students there liked the
song and then left the auditorium
singing it together.

Bateman from Mississippi, appeared
