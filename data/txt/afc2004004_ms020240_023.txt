     The Bible says it does, an' I know it does.  So, but some
peoples just do that.  See, that's them 17 steps to hell, which is,
which is about 13, steps to hell.  You , you see that in Gialations (?)
5:19.  An' um...
AL:  You mean backbiting?
BJ:  Yeah...oh yeah, all those things.  Yeah, that's right, backbiting,
you see.  Underminin' if you wanna say.  An' diffrunt things, of
that kin'.  [But] Co'se backbiting is not underminin' altogether.  It is
in some ways; in some of it, it ain't.  Ya can undermine diffrunt
