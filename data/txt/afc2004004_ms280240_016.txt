know about the, about the Border Country, about this town," he'
says, "This is Mike," to me.  "Well," I says, "Jock," or Willie
it was I called him, I says, "Well now, I know one song that
belongs to this town."  He says, "What's that?"  I says, "I know
two verses, or two verses of a song."  He says, "And what song 
is that?"  I says "The ?Steery Poston          .  So ... I'll
sing it.  So he says, "Well sing it."  So I started ..... I

Stole the flag when they wern sleeping;
Teery Boston, Teery Orden,

A' the borders up in Bawben,
O'er the borders and Awa'."

that's all I could get o' the song.  It was at the High Common
Ridings.  Of course, it's a great day here - we met in  with a lot
of people - ohhoo, we met in with a queer lot of people that
day, and of course we was getting a lot of them drops - a lot
of money, drops.  And he says to me "Man," he says, "There's only
one thing that's not coming up."  And I says, "What's that?"
