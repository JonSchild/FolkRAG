SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD
INTEROFFICE COMMUNICATION

IN REPLY REFER TO 
FILE NO.

TO: Special Service Division,
Bureau of Intelligence,
Office of War Information,
Shreveport, La.,
August 16, 1942.
[*273*]

FROM: Chas. O. Lee, 
Field Recreation Representative,

SUBJECT: Rumors -- Week ending August 15.

During this second week [*I*] have been under the compunction of some rather definite and heavy assignments which gave me little time to "listen in" on conversations. My trips were also made by automobile so I had no opportunity to catch conversations while en route.

During the week in question, I did not hear any rumors which would be classed as such.

Sincerely yours,
Chas. O. Lee
