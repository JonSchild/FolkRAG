From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, New Jersey
Heard of the train between Newark and New Haven Aug 12, 42
Subject: Race Prejudice

"Maybe we think this train is crowded, with
passengers standing up for miles, but I guess we ought
to see the trains on week ends.
"One of my friends told me that the week end train she
went on to Washington was so full of negroes that [*5*]
the smell was terrible and that she was practically
the only white person travelling there."
