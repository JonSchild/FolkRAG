A Private In the Army
1.
There was a private in the army
who was always betting on some
not matter what is was. One 
day the general (1) got tried
of him so he wrote to another
general (2) and told him all
about the private and told
him the he was sending him
to his camp. The minute the 
private arrived in camp the
general (2) call him to his office
and said why do you always
bet on things he said I don't 
know, and then he said I bet
you that you got a mold on
your shoulder. Then the general
says alright I bet you five $
I haven't. So he took off his 
shirt and said look. The private 
you win here's your five $ and then left 
over
