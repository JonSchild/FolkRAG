AL: You think that's a more deadly sin that murder? 
BJ: Oh, yeah. Ah, what, whatcha mean? Shootn' somebody down

BJ: Yeah, he...Yes, in diffrunt forms. You can meet 'im in diffrunt
forms now, a course. But I wouldn't say if that was him or his
imps, 'cause his imps is him also; that's true. But, see...
AL: Were the things that would come and disturb you all when
you were diggin' for money...? 
BJ: Oh yeah. Ah, they wasn't devils; that was them peoples'
spirit... That's right. That's from, same -- Jus' like if you had
money buried an', an' two, three a y'all had buried it together

two, two, three ain't. Well, they come an' run me 'way, if they
can, unlessen you, you know, y'all's spirit get together an' make
