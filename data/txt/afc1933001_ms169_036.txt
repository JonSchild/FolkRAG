Dear Alan:
Thank you for looking after the "rather rabbitty
Mr. Glazer."
Your idea for Todd and Sonkin is very interesting 
and I should love to see them begin with Latin American
survivals in New York City.  I am not quite clear whether 
you are looking for financial assistance through me or 
whether you think it could go by itself.  I'm all for it, 
anyway.
Did I sound as if I thought the Columbia programs
next year could be worked out in a short time?  I know of 
course, that it is a long business.  We are working at top 
speed now.  If I should come down next Tuesday, the 29th, 
could we spend the day working on that material in the L. C.?
With kind regards, believe me
Sincerely yours, 
Carleton
