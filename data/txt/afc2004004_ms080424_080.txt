Roll 54 Stan and Hattie 3

Hat: I guess it was. One time started to (unint.) the creek (unint.)
There was a boy there, said (unint.) was gonna crry me across the creek.
He got right in the middle of the creek and sat me down! I got out and
(unint) and about killed him! And so I went down there to his house the
next day, and his sister said, "You got baptised last night" I said,
"yeah the devil baptised me." That one who baptised me was her brother
you know, and I said "The devil baptised me." Yeah, he made like he
liked me, got right in the middle of the creek and set me down and I got
(unint.)!

AL: Why was it that the women were so skittish about being courted, did they
want to get married?

Hat: No, just plain mean, I guess! I was runnin' from them so long, they's
gonna catch me, I'd give 'em a big right and get 'em in the legs. While
they's get up, I'd get home! .... One time they was after me and I was
runnin', fell in a big mud hole, my face just covered all over with mud.
One of the boys came down, took a handkerchief out and wiped the mud off
my face with it! I run a many a race from them people!

cut to Frank

Lullaby, the kind of tune my father used to do. I learned this one
from him. Called "Baby-O", and it's sung for the older kids too, they never
got tired of it. (plays sings) 'What you gonna do with the baby-o?...."
