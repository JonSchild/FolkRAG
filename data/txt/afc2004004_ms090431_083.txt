Fisk, 15. 5. WILL STARK
dent, the boss, and we was getting lumber for P. F. Stone of Cincinnati,
I think that was what we was cutting, shipping the lumber to.  But
anyhow they'd a lumber inspector there; he was a white man.  He would
come around and tell me sometime he said, "Will, that lumber is just
a little bit too thin; move your pin back a hole further."  Well, I
[set]would tell the block setter and [H]he'd move the hole back further.  Mr.
Bob, he's the superintendent, come around and say, " What the hell did
you move the pin back further?  That [k]lumber's too thinck."  I say, 
"Well, Mr. Lee told me to move th t."  He say, " [Well, Mr. Lee] Put it
back there in that pin."  I say, "Put it back there where he tell you,
Bob, or Paul."  I say, "MR. Lee say that's too thin, a little bit too
light."  He say, "Well, go[g]ddamn it, It's no such thin[.]g.  You tell him
I said so."  I sa[y]id, "No sir, Mr. Barker, Mr. Lee is a white man .
If you want him told, you tell him."  I sid, " Tell him; you ought to
talk to white folks that-a-way."  And he say -- [???] 'cording he's talking
about -- he say, "HEâ€™s a goddamn liar, ain't he?"  I say, " Well, I
ain't talk that way; I wasn't raised that way.  My grandmother raised me
up and taught me to be always obedient to white folks."

[THE YAHOO SONG.] Rowdy Soul
Raise your pl ws, one arm still;
This here plow to Millie.
If I don't make but fufteen sents,
I'm gonna take it back hom[e] to Julie.
Rowdy soul, rowdy soul,
Make no difference if I work or no.

Captain went to church last night,
Set [Right] behind the steeple.
She led afar and
Broke my heart,
Shit (?) all over the people.
Aoro[d]wdy soul, rowdy sol,
Make no difference if I work or no.

Tell my wife when you go to the hills
I got me a job at the Saga mills.
