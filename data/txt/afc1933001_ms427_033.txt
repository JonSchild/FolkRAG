THE JUBILEE OF LABOR

Raise your voices, comrades, in a loud andhearty song
Music is the enemy of tyranny and wrong;
Melody will help us to be resolute and stong,
As we are marching to freedom.

Chorus: Hurrah, hurrah, we'll bring the jubilee,
Hurrah, hurrah, the workers shall be free,
So we'll sing in chorus from the center to the sea,
As we are marching to freedom.

We mean to fight for justice and for equity again
Long the new Grand Army has been gathering its men
Many friends will help us on with ballot, voice, and pen,
As we are marching to freedom.

Chofus:


SONG OF THE WEST VIRGINIA MINERS

We have worked in dark anddanger
We have worked in dark and danger,
We have worked in dark and danger,
Workers in the mine.

Though we work hard we are starving,
Though we work hard we are starving,
Though we work hard we are starving,
Workers in the  mine.

Company holds us all in slavery,
Company holds us all in slavery,
Company holds us all in slavery,
Workers in the  mine.

But we'll rise and gain our freedom,
But we'll rise and gain our freedom,
But we'll rise and gain our freedom,
Workers in the  mine.
