Fisk, 19.  8.

This is Florell Stanford.

I went up-stairs
To say my prayers.
A bullfrog up there
Putting on airs.
Corn bread rough,
biscuit bread tough,
I thank God a man,
I got enough of that stuff.

Hop Rabbit.

Jump, Brother Rabbit,
And It[8]â€™ll be all right.
Asked him where,
Say he all right.
He pulled his tail
Up on his back,
And went on down
To the Marshall track.
Here my hick
A three day, four.
I ain't gonna pick
No cotton at all.
See that house
Up on that hill?
That's where I move,
My belly gonna fill.

Hop, rabbit.
Do your best.
Shake your hip.

Game.

I got a silly brown,
With a hey, hey, hey.
Last one gonna start your brow.

Dear little doctor,
Can you tell
What will make
Miz Harkness well?
Cause she's real sick
And about to die.
That what make
Mr. Harkness cry.

Mr. Frog went a-courtin
With a sway back,
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
The last one got a jelly back,
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
The last one frog is Rubie.

Dear little doctor,
Can you tell
What will make
Miz Carter well?
Cause she's sick
