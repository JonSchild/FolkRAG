Such direct counteraction of a few rumors must be considered
only a small part of the projects program. As it is a
new function, the problems it involves must be clearly recognized.
By direct counteraction is meant the sort of regular
publicity release which presents a rumor and follows it by the
truth. This direct blast at a given rumor is designed to eliminate
the particular item from currency, on the assumption that
if given a choice between a true and false statement, the truth
will always prevail. But to be sure of the desired result the
items that are paired must be clearly labeled truth and falsehood
in some form or another, and in the presentation, care must be
taken that the truth is told as interestingly as the rumor and
can therefore be easily remembered. It is important not to
overstress the Axis source of some rumors. If it is made to
appear that many rumors are Axis born, persons repeat rumors
become suspect and spy hunts in the community might spring up.
Below, an effort will be made to organize some specific suggestions
for direct counteraction programs. This one type of
program is singled out because it represents the newest weapon
in the battle against rumor, the one about which least is generally
known.
IV Education Program--Direct Counteraction
The difference between "truth" and "falsehood must be
to the reader and the good intentions of the information expert
alone are not enough to assure this. Prejudices and emotions
influence the way readers understand things, as do reading habits
