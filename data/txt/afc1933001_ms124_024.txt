Dear Professor Combs,

Do you remember the summer of nineteen thirty-two when John
A. Lomax and I came through Forth Worth and spent an afternoon with
you while you sang us Ground Hog and some [to] other hill ballads?
That version of yours, to a Sharp tune [wne] went in the ballad
book and, while this [*procedure*] may have been unutterably unscientific,
at least the song profited considerably. [I] The project I shall
now broach to you[r however on the] is, on the contrary, rather
unutterably scientific.
[You will recall tha]
The Library, as you know, is in earnest now about building
up an Archive of American folk-song. One of its projects will send me
to Eastern Kentucky for [an e] a two months survey recording trip in
that area in September and October, and I [am] have hoped that you
would be able to supply me with some valuable letters of introduction
and direct me to some virgin territory and some inexhaustible singers
without which and whom the trip would not be half so profitable.
I shall read your volume over [*again*] carefully before I go , but [I hope]
I have thought that perhaps you could [aff] send me some collectors'
information that is not between the covers of your book. [I shall]
At any rate I should greatly appreciate a letter from you with whatever
advice and suggestion you may give me.

With kindest regards, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge
Archive of American Folk Song
