4) And with her I often walked through the borders and green hedges,
When the dewdrops were all sprinkled on the lawn.
Not far from the domain of the late lamented near the
lovely sweet banks of Salonn (?)
For there I often ventured in the stillness of the night,
Through the thicket and the grove where the moon could show no light,
And there I often said to her, "My joy and heart's delight,
You are the charming sweet girl that I love."
5) If my song it were sung in the town where I was born, and where
I shortly shall die,
For it's now I am deserted, forsaken and forlorn,
For the sake of that fair one I am dying.
I do not know her father and I do not know her mother,
I do not know her sister and I scarcely know her brother,
But I swear and do declare to you that I know them altogether
For the sake of the girl that I love.
6) If my song it were sang in it would
soon find it's way to McCroon.
And it's there it would be purchased at fairs and at markets
Where young men and fair maids are going.
Where the songsters they would sing it in voices long & loud,
And who knows but my dear darling might chance to be in the crowd,
For it's then I would sigh and say in a shout,
"How I long for the girl that I love.
