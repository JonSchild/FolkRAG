Detroit, Michigan,
November, 27, 1933.

Mr. Carl Engel,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C..

Dear Mr. Engel:

I am hardly surprised at not hearing from you in Detroit, 
inasmuch as I have just discovered that my last
letter to you consisted of parts of two letters. I apologize 
for this evidence of disorder and hurry. Moreover,
Alan and I have decided to come back by the way of Washington 
and I hope to see you sometime between the fifth and
eight of December. If you have anything to say to me,
naughty or otherwise, my adress through December the
second will be: 60 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

                                                                        Sincerely yours,
                                                                                 John A, Lomax
