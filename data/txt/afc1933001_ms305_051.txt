A Country Calendar

By LUCY CURTIS TEMPLETON

MOST refreshing are immediate results
of the music war between
broadcasters and ASCAP. Long may it
wage!

Just to be guaranteed immunity from
the onslaughts of "Gawd Bless America"
whenever the dial is twirled is cause for
thanksgiving. Exposure to this terrible
tune is one of the minor horrors of the
war. Mr. Berlin himself says it was "too
bad for the World War." In my opinion
it is exactly suited for any war that Hitler
is mixed up in and that still doesn't
make me like it. Even my untutored ear
can detect whole phrases lifted from
"The Sweet By-and-By" and a song popular
when I was a child called "I Don't
Want to Play in Your Yard."

(NOTE: This was written before Mrs.
Roosevelt's reference to the same song
appeared in "My Day.")

It is pleasant to think that we need
have no fear of being sickened by the
smug and sugary strains of "The End of
A Perfect Day" or the "Rosary." It is
encouraging . . . But why go on?

For it is well known that protection
from one evil brings liability to others.
Up to nine o'clock last night there had
gone seven impetuous young lovers leading
with their hearts again and if practice
makes perfect perfection was attained.

There was a noticeable turning to older
tunes and more classical music was
broadcast last (Monday) night on ordinary
programs than I have ever heard before.

Probably my taste is a little peculiar.
I like jazz very much but I also like classical
music and I have a perfect passion
for old ballads and old church music.
One reason for this is because I prefer
music written in a minor key as this music
usually is.

If you share my liking for ballads let
me call to your attention a program
given by the Columbia School of the Air
every Tuesday afternoon at 2:30. It is
directed by Allen Lomax.

By the way if BMI is going to specialize
on old songs they had better learn
their names. Tuesday night I heard
announced "Come Where My Love Lies
Dreaming" and there followed a hot rendition
of "Robin Adair."
