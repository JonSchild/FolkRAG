the BoI of the Office of War Information, which will try to supply necessary
information materials. Sometimes this material will already have
been prepared but not widely enough distributed; or an analysis of
rumors from rumor-control groups may show the need for [preparation

Non-local rumors, for most efficient handling by the
Office of War Information, can be divided as follows:
1. Production: raw materials, agriculture, finished
products, general progress[.]
2. Transportation
3. Manpower: labor, management
4. Economic problems
5. Price control
6. Wage stabilization
7. Rationing, conservation, and salvage
8. War bonds, taxation, inflation
9. Military matters[.]
10. Selective Service
11. Consumer problems
12. Health and welfare
13. Minority[ies]  pon[?]
14. Civilian responsibilities
15. United States Government
