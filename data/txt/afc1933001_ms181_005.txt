Dear Mr. Love:

In reference to your recent letter
concerning Frank Jordan and Jeff Webb, I would
appreciate it if you would inform me of their
counties of residence at the time of their commitment 
to the Mississippi State Penitentiary.

Thank you for your courtesy in this
matter.

Sincerely yours,
