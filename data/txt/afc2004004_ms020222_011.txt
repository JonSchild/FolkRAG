BJ:  They ah . . .Well, they jus' ah, jus' Hard-Shell Baptist.  Ah,
they stiff in belief, jus' like [all the] other peoples, but they is
Baptist, ya know?  They Primitive.  Baptists.  An' so . . .But they
was very good.  They was very strong, too, an' they had meetin'
almost like Holiness now.  Ya know, they had really good, strong
strong meetin's.  Hard-Shelled Peoples.  Much strong, Let me tell
you.  An' um, so . . .
TL:  What's a strong meeting mean?
BJ:  Strong means that they was ah real good Christians.  They had a
good system -- real right kinda systems in their churches.  An' it
mean for all the members to try to -- They, they didn't have ya
in there jus' to be a member;  they wantcha to be livin' something. 
Ya see, you know.  That's what strong mean[s].  Now jus' say, "I 
got a crowd a members," ya know?  But just, just . . .Or whatsoever
you are, be like them, an' be 'em, be right, ya know?  In other
words, they wanted to win (soul?) sumpin' (?) for Jesus like Holiness
people wants to now.  They want to be real, so when you do meet
into the Kingdom of Heaven, ah, when the Lawd should call ya, why, 
ya done did somethin' for Him.  Not jus' drawed up a crowd of
peoples jus' so, ya know.  Ya know, jus' like
You's a school teacher an' you jus' want a crowd of chilren to
come in there an' ain' learn 'em nothin', ya know.  Ain' nothin' 
to it, ya see?  You, you ain't gained anything;  you jus' had a
crowd of chirrun.  They cain't go out an' tell nothin'.   Now, when they
come to the knowledge of understandin' [the good] to do things, then
whatcha go to school for?  Ya see?  So that's what that is.  Ya
want 'em to learn sumpin'; ya want 'em, you want 'em to know
sumpin', learn sumpin' that -- you, you want your work to be benefit,
[that's right.  Yeah.]
