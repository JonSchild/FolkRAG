Washington, D.C.

Dear sir:

Some weeks ago Mr. Davis requested that newspapers refer to
OWI intelligence all rumors which sound dangerous.

Here is one, and it is one in which, I am sorry to say, Frazier
Hunt is given as the authority of the story. I hope he is
not, for the yarn is a bad one.

The Rev. Carl Olson, chief of the Washington county OCD publicity
tells me of a man who is said to have quoted Hunt in a talk
with him and Ed and Jo Simonet.    I have no identification of
the "man".

The story was that Hunt, while in the Twin Cities area visiting
war plants, and making a radio broadcast for General Electric,
told a "private" meeting, that:

1.–– Russia is out of the war so far as being an effective force.

2.–– That the "second front" is out , because of the lesson of
the Dieppe raid.

3.–– That Hitler has an Army of 9,000,000 on the occupied
coasts to forestall an invasion.

Other statements were less dangerous. This "private meeting"
talk on lines diametrically opposed to Mr. Hunt's public
addresses bears every earmark of enemy "line".

Sincerely,
[*Walter T Forbes,*]
Walter T. Forbes.
