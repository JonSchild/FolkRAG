Memorandum to Dr. Spivacke
December 17, 1940

Dear Dr. Spivacke:
     As you know, the project of moving the Archive into its new quarters has been in the prospect for some time, and I think that it should be pushed forward before the first of the year. I am constantly needed to assist Mr. Weisner in business affecting the Archive; the W. P. A. project also could save a great ammount of time if I were near at hand for consultation. Besides, by January 1, if I am not already working on the radio project, I shall be working in collaboration with Mr. Cohen. They,too, are anxious to be established in quarters near to the phono-duplication laboratory. This will mean: 1. moving records into stack space provided for them, 2. setting up the office of the Archive to temporarily service the Radio Project and the Music Project.
     Herewith, I submit the attached floor plan for the division of the office into three parts for the section above mentioned. The cases now used to shelve the Archive records can be used for this purpose. Those remaining, Mr. Weisner needs for his use in the phono-duplicating section. The tables now in the Archive can all be used in the Archive office, and-or by Mr. Weisner in the phono-duplicating division.
     I wish to have my telephone transfered for my own use in the Archive and wish to suggest, specifically, that this not also service the radio project.

                                               Alan lomax
