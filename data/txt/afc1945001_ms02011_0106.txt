"Catholics are getting rich on the war."
"Jews are getting rich on the war."
"Baptists are getting rich on the war."
"Stalin is getting rich on the war." etc.

Such a barrage demonstrates, by its very inclusiveness,
that this is a common kind of rumor, indiscriminately
applied; that the particular rumor is
just another version of another rumor; and that all
rumors of this character are to be mistrusted.
Listing hate-rumors about different groups on masse
helps to expose the basic strategy and fallacy of
hate-rumors.

Advisory Services for Projects

Owing to the complexity and delicacy of the tasks confronting
a rumor-control project, many rumor-control groups have
set up formal local Advisory Boards for their cooperation and
guidance. An Advisory Board can include responsible community
officials; representatives of civic clubs; business, labor and
farm groups; consumer groups; minority groups in the community;
technical experts (from the psychology or sociology department of
local colleges or universities), professional social service
workers (to help deal with community problems) and newspaper and
radio representatives.

An Advisory Board constituted in this way is representative
of all groups in the community. It is technically equipped,
on the basis of the project's collection and analysis of rumors,
