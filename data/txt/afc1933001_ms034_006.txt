Dear Mr. Lester:
Mr. Oliver Strunk, Chief of the Music Division of the Library of 
Congress, has asked me to report to you on the progress I am making on
the work covered by your grant of $ 4,500, dated March 7, 1935. When Mr. 
Strunk's letter came I was on a collecting trip, and I am, therefore, 
only now able to reply. 
This report covers scarcely more that seven months since receiving 
notice of my appointment. During that time my son and I have travelled 
a total of 15, 000 miles in collecting trips. We have forwarded to the 
other records, a total for the time of 261 records. With 300 records
deposited by us in 1934 the total number credited to your patronage 
reaches 561. 
On each of these records songs have been recorded on both sides, one
recording containing from 2 to 8 tunes. A fair average would be five separate
songs for each record, or a total of 2305. Necessarily there are in this number
considerable duplications - where a tune has been variously rendered in different
 localities or where more competent singers have been found after the first
recording. Also among the recordings are interesting examples of the chanting
of Negro ministers, various "hollers" and cattle calls. 
The bulk of the records made this year have come from Georgia, Florida,
and West Texas. A trip to the Bahamas, where a number of records were made,
disclosed the fact that apparently certain American folk tunes originated on
those islands. 
I have drawn $3000 of the amount allotted to this work and have made the following expenditures:
New Machine and supplies                              $450
Repairs                                                                     60
15,000 miles automobile travel at 5 cents       750
Lodging and meals 230 days at $5                   1150
Honorariums to singers                                       111.50
Other incidentals                                                     87.30
                                                                                                      2708.80

Respectfully submitted
