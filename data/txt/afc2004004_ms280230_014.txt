[Miscellaneous songs]

THE DAY WE WENT TO ROTHESAY, O.

One Hogmanay at Glesca Fair, there was me myself and several 
mair,
And we a' went off to haw a tear and spend the nicht in 
Rothesay, O.

We wandered through the Broomilaw,
Throughfrost and rain and hail and snaw,
And at forty minutes after twa
We got the lenght of Rothesay, O.

Chorus:
A dirrum a doo, a dum a day, a dirrum a doo a daddie, O.
A dirrum a doo, a dum a day, the day we went to Rothesay, O.

A sodger lad, named Rhtherglen Will, Wha's regiment's lyin' at 
Barn Hill,
Went off wi' a tanner to have a gill in a public hoose in 
Rothesay, O.
Said he, "I think I'd like to sing."
Says I, "Ye'll no do such a thing."
He said, "Clear the room and mak' a ring
And I'll fecht them a' in Rothesay, O."

In search of lodgings we did slide, to find a place where we 
could bide,
There were eichty twa o' us inside in a single-end in 
Rothesay, O.
We a' lay down to take our ease, when somebody happened for to 
sneeze
And he wakened half a million fleas in that lodging hoose in 
Rothesay, O.

There were several different kinds o' bugs, some had feet like 
dyer's clogs,
And they sat on the bed and they clocked their lungs
and cried, Hurrah for Rothesay, O.
I said, "I think it's time to slope", for the polis wouldna let 
us stop,
So we went and joined the Band of Hope and said farewell to 
Rothesay, O.
