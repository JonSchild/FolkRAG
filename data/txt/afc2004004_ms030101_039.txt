Some did give her a nickle
An' some give her a dime
But I didn't give her a penny.
'Cause she wasn't no piller (pillow) of mine.

Jailer (2) what gonna be my time
Cause my youngest brother in
New Orleans
Spendin' nine, ninety and nine

Jailer (2) how must I sleep
[All around] How [my] must I sleep
All around my bedside.
I see when [Dell] Delia peep.

If I did not shot her
She might have been my wife
But [she] the girl she curse me a very
bad curse
Till I got to take her life
