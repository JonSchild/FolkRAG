The Baptism of the J[?] - Bande Obeisance
- Thomas - habitation Braleton. March 25

Thomas told me that the baptismal
service would be held at five o'clock.
When we arrived, the gate [in]  leading
into the habitation was arched over
with woven palm fronds into which
paper flowers were interlaced. Nobody
had come and nobody came until seven
so we amused ourselves in other ways.

A candle [was lighted] flickered before GuidÃª's cross
in the house of the Braves. On top of the
cross [a new] there was a new baton.
Thomas, the gauga, the master of the 
band, took Baron's bottle of clai[?] which 
has a cross inside it (Baron Samedis 
Baron Cimitiere, Baron de la Croix 's)
and making me lay hold on it
[?] saluted the North of the East

the cross was covered
with a
red mouchoir
