     Two of the stories, nos. 15 and 16, were sent to
MacMillan more than a year ago. They were interested,
but for some reason did not go further. If you think that 
would nullify any further interest by them, then do not 
bother them.
     It occurred to me, though, that they might be interested
in some type of story, say in the donkey tales or
the Prince and Princess stories. If they were, we could
work out further stories of that kind for a small volume.
     I realize that these tales are quite imperfect, but 
they could be polished up quite a bit. Nos. 3 and 7 have
been published, but I can get permission from the publishers
to use them.
     I understand that if you find a publisher, we are to 
complete the project jointly and share equally the royalties.
If you do not find a publisher, I am to receive them back.


Sincerely
J. A. Rickard
