BJ Tape 24, p. 5
is you are wide open, then, you see. And then you[over] over-strainin' 
so much things in you, that you shouldn't do, see?
Other words, ya lettin' your, your, your body give in to that
stuff an' mix with that an' that come from another place an' 
all them things mixes together, that just ain't good for your
body. The Bible even speaks against it. Says a man shouldn't
tech (touch) a woman when she's that way, not even tech 'er;
not on'y go wit' 'er, don't tech 'er, far as that concerned,
see? Ya [g]ot no business ta...An' says she's filthy, see, an' not
ta even touch a woman when she's like that. So. I don't know..
TL: Do most people not touch women when they're like that?
BJ: Oh, sure! A lot of folks--[do'se] I reckon they does. I
see some women's --I heard 'em talkin' about them doin' those
things an' know they was an' know they was in bad shape.. 
So, but rather for any woman that wants to know these things
to write me an let me know An' so, what ail' 'er an' what the trouble
is an' then maybe there's any chance.
There's some people done took medicine when they  young, to
keep from havin' chirrun an' that is done burnt theyse'f up inside,
see? So, all that's all that's in it, ya know. All that's
in it. Then ta git up some size or other, you know, they git up
a good husband or sumpin', then they want chilren. See, well you
know you ain' gonna have none; you done burnt out. See? So all
that's in, in it, ya know. If she's that way, no use a takin'
none, see? Some peoples tuk a whole lof of medicine an' no use a 
was'in' (wasting) time to [turn] bring a dead man ta life [learnt]. Ya
see? Well, it's that way. So you just done done it, done messed
up yourself. Yeah.
