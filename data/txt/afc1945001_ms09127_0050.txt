Rumors 

When I was in the grocery store
last week, the lady standing next to me
said, "Well, we'll be having seven ration
books by April first."  The lady standing
next to her said "Why I sent to
Washington for my canned goods book, 
and they sent me back a clothes 
ration book." The other lady replied, "They
sure do give away their secrets." Why
I heard my husband say that a
man came from Washington to the
factory asking for volunteers to
help make ration books. 
If each lady that heard
all of these things, went home
and talked about it at the supper
table, her children and husband
may make a slip in school or at
work, they're keeping the rumors
moving.
