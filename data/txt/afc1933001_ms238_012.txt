Geographically speaking, Texas has a terrain which
invites differences in musical expressions of personal
adaptation to it. The sea chanteys heard
on the seacoast; the uneven rhythm born of the Aztecs
and adapted by the Spaniards which color the
Mexican border music; the work songs of the
East Texas region passed over the state line from 
the Louisiana "Cajuns" with their French flavor
of a long tale well told in many verses; and the
cowboy songs of the northwest and west, the
one indigenous contribution of the music of [???]
all work into a musical mosaic of which
all Texans may well be proud!
