Dear Dean Benning:

This letter will serve to add my voice in behalf
of my sister Bess Lomax's vacation plans. (1)  My father
is quite old and really needs to see Bess over the vacation.
It would be a terrible deprivation to him if she could not
go to him.  (2)  On the other hand, there is no one else
available who can sing with me on my American School of the
Air program on January 2. The songs to be sung are duets
and in order to give the children an idea of how these were
sung early in the history of this country it will be necessary
to have a girl's voice. My sister and I are accustomed to
singing these songs together. Without her the program will
be only half as valuable as otherwise.

Since this program is agreed on as being of no
little educational importance, and since you undoubtedly realize
my sister is an earnest, extremely sincere person, I hope
you can cooperate by making as light as possible whatever
regular penalties her cuts would entail. She is willing to
return to Bryn Mawr after the 2nd and make up[f]for the hours
she will have lost before Christmas. The whole family will
appreciate your help in this situation.

Very sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
