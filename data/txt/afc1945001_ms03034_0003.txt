Dear Mr. Knapp: 
Thanks for the interesting information about anti-Jewish rumors embodied in your letter of May 15th. 
I am afraid that there are no statistics immediately available to allay these rumors, but we will undertake, if the Army sees fit to release them, to send you whatever figures are available on Jewish selectees and recruits. 
Sincerely yours, 
R. Keith Kane
Assistant Director
In Charge, Bureau of
