February 3, 1942


Dear Mr. Williams:

Yesterday, I saw a letter written to somebody else
by Hugh Carter, 301 St. Mark's Square, Philadelphia,
Pa. Attached to his letter was a two-page carbon
on the subject of war rumors among college women.

I am sending this on to you because I think maybe
Carter might, be the kind of person you are looking
for in the Rumor Clinic set-up â€” or perhaps I am in
the caboose and he is already one of the people you
have been talking to.

                                                  Sincerely yours,

                                                  Cornelius DuBois
                                                  Executive Assistant
                                                  Bureau of Intelligence
