Singing Country: European Heritage 
Lecture 
An eminent/ American musicologist has recently said, "Both in point of geographic 
area covered and in number of people involved, America possesses, along with China, 
India and the USSR one of the fourth largest, most active and most diversified 
musics in the world today."* One of the most remarkable and influential facets
of American music [?] and that which/ix most has interested the scholar
is a rich inheritance of/ ancient British folk song and balladry. A host of medival and 
post-medieval ballads have been found on the tongue [?] of farmers, fishermen,/ and of the 
lively apple-cheeked old old ladies who have made miserable [the reputation of] American [?] 
apple-pie, cornbread and biscuits. [?] The number of these ballads recovered has been watched
as carefully by scholars as the market price of American Telegraph and Telephone
stock by certain interested parties. Less well known, less studied, but no
less interesting [*important*] [?] is the wealth of foreign language songx which is current
throughout America. [?] Stately French ballads [*and*] gay love songs from
[?] Louisiana, French Canada and along the old St. Lawrence-Great Lakes-Mississippi
River trading route; Spanish and Mexican religious plays, love songs and 
corridas in the South-West;/ German [?] folk music in Pennsylvania and/in scattered 
settlements across the face of the whole nation [and] wherever there have been settle-
ments, [of] colorful outcroppings of the native music of national minorities from
all parts of Europe and even Asia. A great deal [*much*] of this material has
never been and possibly never will be [?] absorbed into the main current of
American culture, although America loses something fine and unrecapturable as each 
song goes out of currency. But the English, French, Spanish and German tradition, 
by virtue of long residence in [?] America, have taken on [?] the characteristics
of the land and its life, and will therefore be able to survive in terms, at least 
of their deep influence on American singing, if not in terms of specific songs
and tunes. The same things have happened [?] and are happening to the songs and [*there*]
tunes that Thomas Wolfe/ in his "Old Men of Catawba" xxx [*has described ix*]
