Mr. John A. Laroux,
Library of Congress,
Division of Music,
Washington, D. C.

My dear Mr. Laroux:

I have just received your circular letter requesting for the Library of Congress the words and tunes of songs and ballads current among prisoners, or originating with them.

We have a strong International Club here, composed of all foreign  born women. It is under the leadership of a woman trained in anthropology, Miss Helen Adams.

A good deal of interesting folk song and folk lore material has come to light. Would you be interested in this material in foreign languages, particularly Russian, Portuguese and Lithuanian? We have, too, a few doggerel ballads of the traditional sort.

I am asking one of our internes to get to work collecting this material if you can use it and if I can find a little money to finance this extra work.

Sincerely yours,

Miriam Van Waters

Superintendent.
