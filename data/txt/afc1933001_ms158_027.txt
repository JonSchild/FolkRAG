Mr. Hugh Hodgson, Director
The University of Georgia
Department of Music
Athens, Georgia

Dear Mr. Hodgson:

Thank you for your kind letter of June 16.  I am glad 
to hear that Mr. McGarrity has found a position as I am 
not sure that we could put him on right now.

Mr. Lomax has been out of town for quite a while recently 
but I shall remind him to write you on his return to 
Washington.

We government workers get very little vacation so that 
I expect to be in Washington most of this summer.  Of course 
I shall be away for a week or two some time, so should appreciate 
your letting me know when you expect to be here.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
