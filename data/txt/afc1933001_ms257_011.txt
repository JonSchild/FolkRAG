Dear [Cavanebiu?] —
Hello and how are you
[?...] This will be a 
pleasant surprise to
you to get this little 
note from me —
But as you see my 
friend Alan Lomax is
coming to Mexico so I
am taking this pleasant

advantage to have him
carry this little note to you
and to have him say hello
to you for me and meet
you at the same time —
Lomax as you already know 
is in change of Archive
of American Folk Music
and I know that you are 
much interested in the
same kind of Music
so you both will have 


a goodeal to sing and to
talk about and I am sure
that you will both be glad to 
meet each other and sing
a fold song or two together
I regret that I cannot 
come along with my friend
Lomax so that we could have
a drink of red wine together
and listen to a few songs
at any rate good luck to
you and good health and
my best wishes to the Misses 
[Bufano?]
