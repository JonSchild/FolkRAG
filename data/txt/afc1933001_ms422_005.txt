outlines for teachers of Junior and Juvenile 
classes in Farmers Union Locals, and 
pamphlets on various subjects of interest 
to Farmers Union members, as well as 
those which will further education in 
cooperative philosophy. 

Since the different age groups of the 
Farmers Union membership find it impossible 
to use the same lessons, it is 
the purpose of the Education Service to 
prepare lesson units which will be suitable 
for all age groups in the Union. Since 
the Farmers Union is an educational organization 
and an all family organization,
the entire family should have access 
to its education. 

Study Units with suitable texts are in 
preparation for all age groups of the 
Farmers Union from the tots to the 
adults. 

FREE SERVICES 

The Education Service prints and sends 
to each state, free of charge, the monthly 
program service for Locals, each month. 
Mimeographing, assembling and mailing 
these programs were a considerable burden 
on the office of the State Junior 
Director both as to preparation and as to 
financial considerations. The printed programs 
are much less expensive and mailing 
charges are much less. 

Printed Manuals, printed lesson outlines 
on the National Farmers Union 
Study Topic, Reading Lists, Manuals for 
Junior Reserves and Juveniles are also 
on the free list and are furnished to each 
state in such quantities as the State 
Leader specifies. 

PRINTING SERVICE 

Much of the material which has heretofore 
been mimeographed in the various 
state offices, can be printed much more 
cheaply, if orders are pooled through the 
Education Service. The Education Service   
pays the initial charge for the printing 
and each state is furnished the 
amount of material needed at cost. This 
is a real opportunity to demonstrate co-operation 
and to do away with the 
capitalistic waste of duplication. 

Worthwhile pamphlets will also be 
printed by the Education Service and    
sold through it, at a cost which will 
defray handling charges. 

CAMPS AND SCHOOLS 

Short courses in schools or institutes 
during the winter months will be supervised 
by the Education Service, and district 
camps will also be a part of the 
work of the Service. Correspondence 
Courses in cooperative education will also
be under the direction of the Education 
Service. 

The lesson outlines for the camp classes 
held in the four states will be prepared 
by the Director of the Education Service
