it, the parson was in it, the squire was in it --
everybody was in it, you see. You never knew who
you were dealing with. So far as the King's men
were concerned, they didn't stand an earthly,
unless they brought the soldiers with them and 
caught them red-handed, and then it came to a fight
because if they'd brought that stuff, perhaps in bad
weather, across from the continent and were going to
run it in, perhaps to Bury St. Edmunds or further
north, and they got caught on the beach with it and
they'd gone all that far, you see, they weren't
going to chuck it up then because the soldiers were
there; so they were armed and they put up a fight,
and plenty of them were killed.
Lomax: Sometimes the smugglers won?
Robts: Sometimes, yes, yes. Not  far from where I live, -
about three fields away, there's a church in the 
fields. You can't get to it except by going across
the fields, and there are three graves in that
churchyard, -- little tiny tombstones, they're very
old -- they were found when the church was restored
some fifty years ago, and no name on it. Each one
had a little skull and crossbones. And they were the
graves of local lads who were smugglers. But you know,
people in those days were very religiously minded, and
although they were killed smuggling stuff in at the
Cat House, that's the next reach up from where I live,
landing stuff there, killed on a skirmish with the
king's men, the relatives and parents pleaded with the 
local clergyman not to just bury them in unconsecrated
ground -- that was worse than being a smuggler, and 
persuading him that they could be buried in a churchyard.
Alright, he said, but no names. So they were
buried in a churchyard and their relatives were happy.
Lomax: Let's put your Smuggler Boy in here at this point. Any
time you like.
1) One cloudy morning abroad I did roam,
For the sea breaketh white on the beaches with foam,
When I heard a poor boy who in sorrow did weep,
"Alas, my poor father lies out in the deep."
2) "My father and mother so happy did dwell
In a trim little cottage by the River Orwell,
But my father would venture out on the salt sea,
For a keg of good brandy from the land of the free.
