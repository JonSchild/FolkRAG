The most striking regional differences are as follows:

1.   New England:   This region is conspicuous for the great number of anti-British and anti-Semitic rumors current, while those directed against the administration and the Army and Navy are fewer than elsewhere.  Stories of the abuse of men in the service are unusually prominent as are stories of excessive casualties.

2.   Atlantic Seaboard:   Anti-British and anti-Semitic rumors are prominent.  Stories of excessive casualties, insanity, plagues, etc. in the armed forces are likewise high.  Stories of spy activity, rumors attacking the administration, and atrocity stories are less numerous than elsewhere.

3.   South:   This region is conspicuous for the high frequency of fear-inspired rumors.  Stories of spy and Fifth Column activities are unusually high.  Anti-negro rumors are almost exclusively confined to this area, while rationing rumors have singular prominence.

4.   Middlewest:   Wedge-driving rumours are higher in the Middlewest than anywhere else in the country, particularly those directed against the administration.  Criticism of Army and Navy leaders, and stories of the inadequacy of Army equipment are particularly high.  Excepting atrocity stories, fear rumors are comparatively few.

5.   Far West:   The far west shows a high frequency of wedge-driving rumors.  Particularly rumors directed against both business and labor.  Excepting for atrocity stories, fear inspired rumors are notably scarce.
