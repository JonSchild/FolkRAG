THE PLANTER AND THE SHARECROPPER
(Comment for the song ---) (Type that can be easily read without glasses ....)
This song is real. I mean it's a humdinger. If you dont believe it, turn into your old family bible and read the 4th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, where it shows what you got to do to first become a Christian, "Them that had houses and lands and other property sold them and throwed all of the money, and houses, and lands into one big treasure, and nobody said, I own this, or I own that, but everybody owned everything equal and alike, and there wasn't no rich folks, and there wasn't no poor folks, and every-body had everything they needed it was because --- everybody owned everything alike". These rich landlords harp about being church members and Christians .... and they call us infidels and unbelievers, and ..... they are liars and the Truth ain't in 'em.
