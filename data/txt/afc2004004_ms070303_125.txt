A minister [named Mccauley] in deal pay. Hows
- Campbell was his name & nearly 
did the job - but he managed 
to get to Skye. He was never 
liked after that so he had to 
fly out of the island -

I was born up there on the
hill.  I tried to leave but I 
didn't.  The Mc Ne were famous 
raiders, no body going to sea 
would beat them.  There was one 
time they plundered a ship 
between Bara & N. Ireland & 
they looted the best of the cargo 
& they didn't do any damage 
to the men - [took] sent them 
home.
Morven raid - They came abreast of Iona 
& walked into the cemetary - they stole 
nine of the tomb stones rather than 
come back empty handed. -
