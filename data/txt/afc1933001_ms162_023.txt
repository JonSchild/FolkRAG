Mr. Alan Lomax
Music Division, Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am interested in American folk-song and folk-lore and
would like to apply for a position in the Folk-song section
of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. 

I am a young, just graduated from New York University, 
June 1940, where I have taken courses in the above subjects;
and where, in the spring of 1939 while Miss Barnicle was away
in England, I had the pleasure of your stimulating instruction.  
This last summer I spent in a remote community in
Breathitt County, Kentucky, living with the people, learning 
their ways and gathering some of their songs. 

An academic approach to folk material seems to me unproductive, 
and I would rather learn by working with collections, 
going out on field trips, and allowing my readings to
follow my interest and investigations. For these reasons, 
the Folk-song section of Music Division with its
extensive activities directed toward this method seems a 
more appropriate institution for me to work in with my
particular approach than graduate courses with higher
degrees.

I should value your advice; and if you wish to see me at
any time, I could come to Washington at your convenience. 

Respectfully yours,
Gertrude Zwenig
