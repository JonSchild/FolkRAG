Registration and Fees

Those wishing to receive transferable credit should apply for admission:
undergraduate students to Dr. Frank R. Elliott, Director of
Admissions, and graduate students to Dean Fernandus Payne. If possible
this should be attended to well in advance. The graduate courses
offered in the Institute (numbered 300) carry three semester-hours of
credit; the undergraduate (numbered 200), two hours.

Students desiring University credit will pay the regular University
fee for the half semester. The fee for eight hours for a student
who is a resident of the State of Indiana is $27.50. The fee for eight
hours for a student who is not a resident of the State is $39.18. Fees
for students carrying more than or less than eight hours will be adjusted
according to the number of hours involved.

Members of the Institute not desiring credit should sign with the
University Registrar as an "auditor," and pay a fee of $2 per credit
hour for those courses he plans to audit.

No charge is made for visitors to the Institute for a period of ten
days or less.
