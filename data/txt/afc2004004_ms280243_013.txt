Robertson: That ws a fact. It was quite true. Anybody in Fyvie
would've told ye. If you asked any of the old people in Fyvie, they'd
have told you the whole story about it. It was a true fact. They
broke her back, because she said, "If you strike me, I will cry,
and gentlemen will hear me." But at the very same time Lord Fyvie
rode past the door and her back was broken before he came in; and
that's what he said, "The fairest flower was cut down by him, that
ever sprung in Fyvie." You see- "the place where the burn runs
clear through the Isle - "I've often gaen to meet my love, my ain
true Andrew Lammie." There's a thing putten up there for them, and
there's two turtle doves. And a lot of old people believe that
they're still to be seen there.
Lomax: That the ghosts come back?
Robertson: Well, they beleiev it anyway. But it's true facts - it's
no fiction. When Andrew Lammie came home he was stricken with
grief and sorrow. Well, from that day that he came back to her and 
got her dead and getting buried, he disappeared, and nobody ever
knew what came of him. So therefore --- about two hundred years - and
more, two hundred and thirty years after it - into a secret passage
belonging to Lord Fyvie at his castle - a secret passage - a skeleton --
the exact pipes and things and a trumpet was round the skeleton's
neck - so they always said he must have murdered him through jealousy.
A lot of people said that the grave just opened and swallowed him.
That was just rubbish. It was lord Fyvie that murdered him, because
she was killed, you see. If Andrew Lammie had not come into things,
she might have took Lord Fyvie, you see. But it's a true story. And
Jean's been up to her grave.
On Alan's request, she sings: -
Her father struck her with a sword, and also did her mother.
Her brother broke her back e'er they held o'er, for the loving o'
Andrew Lammie.
"For if you strike, I will cry,
And gentlemen will hear me.
Lord Fyvie, he'll be riding by and he'll come in and save me."

The Reel of Torragorran: Jean Robertson.
Cme, gie us a song, Montgomery cried,
To wear your disputes all aside,
It's nonsense for a man to chide
For what's been done afore them.
Let Whig and Tory all agree,
Whig and Tory, Whig and Tory,
Let Whig and Tory all agree.
And dance this reel.
Let Whig and Tory all agree and come and dance this reel with me,
The reel of Torragoran.
