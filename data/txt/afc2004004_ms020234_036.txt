Don't care how much money -- if he had a thousand dollars, if he
had it, an' I spent it up today, he'd never say nothin' about it.
Never ask ya what ya do with it or nothin'.   All he say, he wanted 
sumpin' to wear an' sumpin' to eat, an tha's all.   An' he know
I'm gonna git that for him.   See, I was that way; I was...be sure
he had his clean clothes an' his good clothes an' his good food.

TL:         The anger is his, huh?
