the elementary school system in Louisiana.  And that turn
about was a long time coming, but it was, I think, a natural
thing that came fron the inside.  And yet, as I said in the,
in the beginning, it, it was a natural movement that came
from the inside and yet had help from the outside.  The
national folk festival, for example, in 1936, was already
inviting Cajun musicians out.  In, in the '60s the Newport
Folk Festival, '64, '65 to '66, '67, invited Cajun musicians
up there and they sang alongside Joan Baez and Buffy
St. Marie and Peter, Paul and Mary, and those types of folks.
And, and they felt really good about it.  They, [CLEARS
THROAT] the, the newspapers hear in Louisiana were, were
reporting back then when the talent scouts from Newport were
here that what, what a ludicrous idea it is for talent
scouts to be looking for talent among Cajun musicians.  I
mean the two terms didn't have, didn't have anything to do
with each other, you know.
LOMAX  The, the thing was [true] on the
Newport board.  I, when I suggested that they invite Cajun
music one year and [UNCLEAR] music the next year that,
nobody on the board had ever heard of either one, including
Peter Seger.  But we sent some people down who soon found
out that this was one of the richest veins in the whole
tradition.
