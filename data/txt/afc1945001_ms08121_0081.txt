What Some People
Will Start
Well it all started one day 
when a lady said that she had
used her old sugar book up and
that she had sent into the government
for a new one, and by mistake
they had sent her a ration book
for clothes. She then said that
they were only going to be allowed
$38.50 for a year. Well this rumor
spread and spread and spread
until about a month later it 
reached the government. The
government said that if anyone
could bring the book in they
would give them $200.00 reward, but
know one showed up.
This is just to show you 
what some people will will start
in times of War.
