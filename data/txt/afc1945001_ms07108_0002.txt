August 6 - The following was brought out in a casual conversation with
another employment representative, who said: "There is a strong feeling against 
the Jews in this area, especially Omaha, I think because that is where most of
them are located, and many times, I am inclined to believe they are to blame for
this feeling, themselves. I find many people even prefer the Negro to the Jew
and while we have out down discrimination in the State, many employers
still have a very strong feeling of resentment against them and won't hire them at all."
While there is no doubt that a certain resentment against the Jewish people does
exist, there are no open or noticeable conflicts on the Negro or Jewish question
in this area. The Martin Bomber Plant, for instance, does not discriminate and
at the present time, approximately 200 Negroes are employed on the grounds and
in the plant, in fact, I am told one of their best welders is a young Negress.
While there are still some organizations who refuse to hire the colored people,
generally speaking, there are no racial conflicts in this area at this time. [*[Omaha] Nebr.*]
