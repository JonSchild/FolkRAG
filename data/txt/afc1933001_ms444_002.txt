Mr. John A. Lomax
Mr. Alan Lomax

My dear Messrs. Lomax,

I trust I may be forgiven for sending you identical
letters, the original to father, and the copy to son.

I enclose a copy of an agreement which this Company
has made in connection with the use of "Alla En El Rancho Grande"
for your information. I likewise enclose a copy of Mr. Taft's 
letter of May first to me which is self explanatory, and I 
further attach the affidavits referred to in Mr. Taft's letter.
I think you will find it in order for each of you to sign these.
I shall appreciate it if you will kindly do so and return them
to me.

Sincerely yours,
George P. Brett Sr
