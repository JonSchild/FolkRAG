Rumor Report -- Week of August 3, 1942

E. Rumors Concerning Jews
1. A drug salesman who comes into my store told me that Leon [*6}
Henderson is a Jew. He said he knows his family, and they are half
Jewish. That's the reason there are so many Jews in the O.P.A. They're
not going to let the war hurt their business.
Shamokin -- 8/8/42. Druggist. Has store for 30 years. Community
leader.

2. The Jews are getting all the important jobs in O.P.A. and [*6*]
W.P.B., so you don't expect them to do anything that would hurt their
business, do you?
Harrisburg -- 8/7/42. Insurance salesman. Above average intelligence.

3. The Jews are running this war. Look at the thousands of [*6*]
them in Washington and the war agencies scattered throughout the
country. Leon Henderson is a Jew. Then there is Gruenberg, down
there in Philadelphia, in charge of the Rent Control Board of O.P.A.,
and a lot of others. When this war is over, I'm telling you this
country will be ruled by the Jews.
Kulpmont -- 8/8/42. Successful middle class business man. Well
know around the coal region.

4. You don't see the Jews going into the Army, do you? I
know why, too. A lot of them are doing what this Mt. Carmel Jew did. [*6*]
Sold or gave his son his business, and then the son, who should have
been classified I-A, said he supported his father and mother -- they
then became his dependents.
Ashland -- 8/8/42. County official and business man. Above average
intelligence. His opinion counts in this area.

5. The Jews want this war. Look at the big Government contracts
they're getting. Before the war is over, the Jews will have [*6*]
all the money. Bernard Baruch is a Jew, and he'll see to it that
the Jews control the rubber market before the war is over.
Harrisburg -- 8/7/42. Young trucking company executive. Has definite
anti-Jewish complex.

6. The Jews are being kept out of all officers' positions [*6*]
in the Navy. They don't have a chance to get a commission or rating.
Philadelphia -- 8/8/42. Jewish business man. Appeared to have some
college training.
