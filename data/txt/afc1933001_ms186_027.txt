Dear Alan Lomax:
I don't recollect any version 
of The Wife of Usher's Well as
being mine. Who sang it? It's 
all right, of course, to use it.
I had written H Spivacke 
who suggested Camp Shows, Inc.
Surely he didn't see the recent
Sat. Eve. Post article! Horton + I
would be fish out of water in vaudeville.
Could you enlarge a little on your suggestion
that we "get into work" in our "own locality"
"and establish" ourselves here? Last year was
my first with this particular program. The
only out-state engagement was at Pittsburgh
where things went particularly well.

The scope of the Society's work includes the collecting, editing, publishing, and active teaching
of all the musical traditions of English-speaking peoples: songs, ballads, carols, and folk hymns;
American folk-games and square sets, English and American country dances, English sword dances
and morris dances.
