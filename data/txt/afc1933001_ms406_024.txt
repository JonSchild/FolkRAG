GODAMIGHTY DRAG

     His nickname was Track Horse, and he's dead now. His body was
a thick wedge of strength that could tie a rainbow round his shoulder*
all day under the hot broiling sun, and he had the voice of a lead
man for both work songs and spirituals. The lead man has to have a 
strong carrying voice, but most of all he has to dare to thrust out
ahead of the rhythm with his verse lines so that the refrain burst 
out of the gang like beer out of a bung-hole.
     In his "Godamighty Drag" -- "drag" here meaning a hot, syncopated
tempo--each prisoner tells his own story. When one leader slacks
his singing, another prisoner speaks his individual mind, and the 
group roars assent--"Wo, lawdy!"--as if to say, "That's true for you
and the same damn thing happened to me."
     "I" and "me" in the Negro work songs, blues, and hollars are 
always thus expressions of the feeling of the Negro community as
well as of the individual who is singing. The first person singular
means, "I, the Negro woman or man"--not self-consciously so, but 
because, as the song passes from one singer to another with its burden
of common experience, it can invisibly and immediately belong
to the individual singer. The melodic and literary forms involved
are so universally familiar that the material can be remolded with
facility by each victim of "the blues." The root of this communal
quality, whenever these songs voice a complaint, is the community
tragedy of the life of the Southern Negro.
          If anybody asks you who compose this song,
          Tell 'em it's Three Part Devil, done been here an' gone.
