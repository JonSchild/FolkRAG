DID BESSIE SMITH BLEED TO DEATH WHILE
WAITING FOR MEDICAL AID?

By John Hammond

Bessie Smith was killed during the last week in September, and
perhaps the greatest and least appreciated artist in American jazz is gone.
My own admiration for her has been expressed too often to warrant repeating
here again, but I feel like kicking myself for not having done more to make
her art known to thousands who might really have appreciated her and had they
only had the opportunity.

A particularly disagreeable story as to the details of her death 
has just been received from members of Chick Webb's orchestra, who were in
Memphis soon after the disaster. It seems that Bessie was riding in a car
which crashed into a truck parked along the side of the road. One of her
arms was nearly severed, but aside from that there was no other serious injury,
according to these informants. Some time elapsed before a doctor was
summoned to the scene, but finally she was picked up by a medico and driven
to the leading Memphis hospital. On the way this car was involved in some
minor mishap, which further delayed medical attention. When finally she did
arrive at the hospital she was refused medical treatment because of her color and
bled to death while waiting for attention.

Realizing that such tales can be magnified greatly in the telling,
I would like to get confirmation from some Memphis citizens who were at the
spot at the time. If the story is true it is but another example of disgraceful
conditions in a certain section of our country already responsible
for Scottsboro, the Shoemaker flogging, and the killing and maiming of
legitimate union organizers.
