"The Pearls"
All Piano
Full of all Jelly's technical tricks [&]
manipulation - runs, arpeggios,
breaks in the treble register, trills -
particularly lovely passage in second
strain on 2nd side -
A very removed, objective breed of music
All of this of Jelly's --technically proficient -
and cold - the beat rather monotonous
[&] metronome like - no drive, not great
heart - brilliance but little heart or
passion.  Narcissist.
