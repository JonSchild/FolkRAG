this [scholarship] fellowship for [two] three years. Through it I was able to travel in every state west of the Mississippi River in my search for the rough ballads of the West, for I not only found cowboy songs but the songs of the Mexican vaquero, miners' songs, lumber-jack songs, songs of the Forty-Niners', Mormons' songs, tramp songs, and occasionally a beautifully rhythmic tune that had its origin with [black] Negro labor.
     To secure the music of these songs I took with me an old-fashioned Edison phonograph with a simple recording apparatus [with] and a large horn for picking up the voices of my singers.  I often had great difficulty in getting men to sing into it.  Occasionally a liberal use of stimulants helped with a group of cowboys.  I carried the heavy cumbersome machine sometimes on horseback, at times afoot.  I visited local ranches and roundups.  I attended frontier celebrations, frequented saloons, interviewed wandering gypsy singers.  A folk song is [very] elusive; always the best version is known by another singer far away, over the hills, in the next county, in the next state, perhaps hundreds of miles distant.  Sometimes I would travel for a day or two in the pursuit of one tune only to find that my information was inaccurate or that the owner of the tune had 
traveled on into some unknown country.
    The first results of my travel (up till today I estimate a total of 250,000 miles) was embodied in a volume of 400 pages, published in 1910 and under the title of Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads.  No leading publisher wanted the book.  It was finally 
brought out by a small publishing house long since defunct.  The
