Ethel Gibson 4th                          English

Sergeant: "Say private when did you
shave last?"
Private: "This morning, sir, why?"
Sergeant: "Next time you shave, get closer to your razor."

Once there was a little boy and
he had a little dog. Now the boy and
his dog went for a walk. When they
passed by the butcher shop, the little
boy picked up his dog and ran, as
the butcher was standing in the
doorway with a knife in his hand,
and the butcher shop was empty.
