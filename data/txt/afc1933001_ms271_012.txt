WHEN I'M GONE, SALLY DON'T YOU GRIEVE   (4)

1) I just got my Army call, 
I run down to the Army Hall,
Sally come a running like a cannon ball,
And I told her not to grieve after me.

Chorus: It's when I'm gone, Sally don't you grieve,
It's when I'm gone, Sally don't you grieve,
It's when I'm gone, Sally don't you grieve,
And I told her not to grieve after me.

2) I'm a gonna cross that ocean wide,
Army rifle by my side,
When Hitler's beat, you can be my bride,
I told her not to grieve after me.

[(chorus)]
3) I'm a gonna jump in a flying machine,
Load it full of this T.N.T.,
Stop old Hitler, what I mean!
I told her not to grieve after me.
[(chorus)]

4) Sally, get a job and save your pay,
Work your best for the U.S.A.,
Buy you a war bond every day,
I told her not to grieve after me.
[(chorus)]
