Mr. Robert H. Knapp, Chairman
Division of Propaganda Research
Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety
18 Tremont Street
Boston, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Knapp: 

We have quizzed the War Department on the question 
set forth in your letter of May 15th and regret to report to 
you that the facts available to the War Department about Army 
personnel do not include data which will make it possible to 
answer your question. 

It has been suggested that steps be taken, through 
a private organization, to investigate the ratio of Jewish 
selectees and enlistees to the Jewish population and to the 
normal representation in the armed forces. It is possible 
that at some future date, through such a private investigation, 
we may be able to forward to you a definitive answer 
to your problem. 

I wonder if, in the meantime, we can ask a favor 
of you. 

We would like to know the range of work carried on 
by your Division of the Massachusetts Committee on Public 
Safety.  Are you conducting any investigations related to 
public attitudes toward the war effort, and, if so, may we 
have copies of them? 

Thanking you in advance for your interest, I am

Sincerely yours, 
(Signed) R. Keith Kane
