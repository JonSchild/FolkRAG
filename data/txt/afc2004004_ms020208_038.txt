Reverend Roe.  Reel 13.  P. 5

so any man can be saved under any condition, and that condition is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

A:  Reverend, what do you hope to see when you pass on out of this world?

R:  I hope to go to a better world.  I have that confidence in God's word, and there is a land, there is a place prepared for the faithful.  I believe that

A:  What do you think it will be like there?

R:  Well, I tell you, my honestly belief is it'll be this world, at least a great part of my life after death will be right here.  And the Bible teaches that, that you'll reign with Christ here a thousand years, and it said the pants shall judge the nations.  They'd set on thrones with Christ in Jerusalem.  That's the Bible.  Well, that's gonna happen; it's coming to pass.  I believe that because the Bible teaches it as God's word, and I believe that the righteous will set on thrones and they'll judge the world.  And I believe that if you're saved, if you've been a man that thought you was better than I and have mistreated me because of that idea, I believe you'll be just as far below me in that day as I am you now.  If you liked it and wanted it to be carried on and use your influence in that way I believe you'll reap what you sow.  -- Yeah -- I don't wish it so, but if it's so, it's just true.  I wish no man no harm - no - I'm very well satisfied at the humble place that I occupy in the world.  I've adjusted myself to conditions because adjust himself to the conditions around him.  I don't see myself as part of it; I see myself as one trying to make it better.  I'm leading out of that atmosphere: it doesn't touch me, the prejudice and all a that is something aside from me; I'm satisfied with God.

I would go off here on that and get into a cave on the hillside and have my food and my clothes and stay out there; that's just the way I feel.  I'd like to meet you, and I'd like to talk with you and I'd like to
