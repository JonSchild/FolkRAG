On August 7, a young woman shopper was heard telling two other
young  women that a relative of hers employed at Fort Jackson had seen
fresh bread and "perfectly good meats" being thrown away on many occasions
when "he would have been very glad to take the food home for the family."
The young women to whom this statement was made said that they had heard
similar reports and that it was disgraceful for "the army to be wasting
food" when many civilians were "doing without" because food prices were
so high in Colombia.
