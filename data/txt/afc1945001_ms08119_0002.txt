            One day last week a group pf
friends and I were talking about
the war situation. One of the girls
said that if Hitler was dead the war
would soon end. Another one of the
girls' replied that Hitler was dead and
that he died by the hands of his own
Gestapo. She went on to say that several
of his friends were planning a raid
on New York and Boston to avenge
Hitler's death. Everything is planned
for the raid and they will come
over in 100,000 large bombers.
