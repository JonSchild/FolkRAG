There was one request that he made when he died
He wanted to ride                 ???
Old Muggins to his grave.
It's lay mu spurs upon my breast,
My rope and old saddle tree,
And while the boys are lowering me to rest,
Go turn my horse free.
Chorus

Give my respects to Bud Burdett
Old Larry he did cry
And raise me up and let me see
Old Blue Dog ere I die
He was so weak he could scarcely speak
In a moment he was dead .
Oh let's go in and carve the beef
Were the very last words he said.

If either of these songs
has fallen into the net cast by you and your
father- and I can't believe that you didn't
find them all-- I assume that the records will
be in the Library of Congress. But if you can
help me with any other information, especially
the words of the "Ogallally song," it will be
very greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
Helena H. Smith
