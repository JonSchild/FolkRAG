Once upon a time there was a little
boy who owned a chameleon. He had been
told that the little animal would
change to whatever color of material
he was placed upon. The little boy
put the chameleon on a piece of red
cloth and he turned red, he placed
him on a green piece of cloth and he
turned green. Finally the little boy
put him on a piece of checkered cloth,
and he died of apoplexy.

During K. P. duty the "rookie" wasn't
making much progress. A general
happened to pass the door and said,
"Hurry up and finish, peel 'em'," the rookie
replied, "But these potatoes are just like
peas sir." "Shell em", replied the
general.
