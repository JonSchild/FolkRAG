He returned to the factory on the next night
To investigate the glass
There was no glass anywhere to be seen
Immediately he thought of the Frank lass

Frank was there all the time
And he let Bob know by a falling crane
Carol, the bosses daughter screamed and
he thought for a moment
That she had gone insane

Well as for Frank, he was caught
And Bob was rewarded.
And for Carol the intended bride
All other boys were discarded.
