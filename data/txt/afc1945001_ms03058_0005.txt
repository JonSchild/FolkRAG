From: Wisconsin Field Representative
Richard C. Wilson
Subject: Rumor Report due October 10, 1942

All of the rumors in this report were obtained in the 
City of Milwaukee.  The persons who assisted us in gathering
them were cooperative, and anxious to help.  However,
they had difficulty differentiating between opinions and
rumors, and many times wrote down opinions that had been
expressed to them, failing to jot down the source.  Thus,
what may appear to be opinions in this report, in reality
is rumors.  At no time were opinions of our rumor-gathering
assistants included.

Members of the Milwaukee Police Department are not permitted
to report rumors to anyone but their superiors.  Therefore,
it was necessary for us to obtain the rumors heard by policemen
through the chief.  He was most cooperative, and assigned
the job of rumor reporting to a representative officer in each
of the seven districts in the city, thereby giving a cross-
section of what Milwaukee people are saying about the war.  He
explained he did not want to report rumors for just one part
of the city.

The drugstore from which we obtained rumor reports is in an
apartment house district on the near east side of Milwaukee.
Most of its customers are middle class and work in downtown 
offices and shops.  The neighborhood has no predominate nationality
