7.  Mirth and music would there be found
Stringed fiddles played at every place
Bagpipes fingered - and that was the music
Which would raise the minds of the youths very high
Every deft, brown-haired young maiden
Would have a kind lad by the hand
Springing like a roe through the moor
Dancing in the room of the lawcourt!
8.  Were there a case of bad repute
There would be found for it equity and law;
Able and celebrated men
That would manage each case as it ought
The beloved Laird of Achallader
That would not see a poor man hurt;
The Laird of Glenure - so sagacious! -
These decided all cases at court.

"It was joy was in the creature's heart: the joy o' hell, I
daursay; joy whatever. Monay a time I have askit mysel'
why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls (whilk are their
maist dear possession) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl't wives or
auld, feckless, doddered men; and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik
dancing a' thae hours by his lane in the black glory of his heart.
Nae doubt they burn for it in muckle hell but they have a grand
time of it whatever! And the Lord forgie us!"
