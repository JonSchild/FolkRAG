Apr. 20. Friday Durham -

Yesterday talk with a fine
blooming Englishman, Alan Bush
about going East. He has grown
big since I saw him, which
shows what working hard for
the right side will do.

Then a long drive through
a rather lovely, mild, middle
western English countryside to
Durham. Town square church
spire gren black in a night sky
and a picture to be lifted
with a French jack. The first
night's sleep I've had in months
brought me out of a gloomy fog
of weariness to almost human-
ness again. One must be liked,
not tentatively or flirtatiously
liked, but with the whole heart.
And unselfishly.
