Gentlemen,
In response to your announcement requesting the name or information
of some one who knows and can sing old Ballards, I will mention the name of Edith
Padgett of Tellico Plains, Tenn.
She was written up in a recent edition of Time Magazine under radio. 
She is also well known as a wild boar hunter, having had quite a bit of publicity
regarding that.
Shas a number of quite old songs and sings well.  Her mother sings w it
an accordion.  They have lived for several generations in the Tennessee mountains
and until last fall when she had her first trip to Nashville she had never seen
a traffic light or talked over a telephone.  She is quite intelligent and reads
a great deal, just never had been out of her mountains.
I am writing this with her permission.

Thanking you
Very truly yours,
Margaret Shaub
