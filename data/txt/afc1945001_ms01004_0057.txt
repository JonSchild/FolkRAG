Report on nature and prevalence of rumors

Replying to your query of July 3rd, I believe that
we will be in a much better position to comment on the prevalence
of rumors when we have utilized the OGR Field Staff to report
same.  He will then be in a position from week to week to note
the ebb and flow of rumors and their local and regional nature.

Evidence at our command now is so spotty in character
and disconnected chronologically as to make possible only the 
broadest generalizations.

If you believe the matter not so urgent as to require
an immediate report, I suggest that you hold us responsible
for a report on rumors about six weeks from now.
