There are several simple rules which the [project] rumor-control groups can help
to publicize as [its major and] a major and permanent campaign. These rules are:

1. Never repeat a rumor
2. Do not repeat a rumor verbally, even to deny it.
3. If you know the facts which can spike a rumor, cite
the facts promptly.
4. If you do not know the facts which can stop a rumor,
ask the rumor-teller where he got his facts.
5. Don't give a rumor a break.

It is worth noticing that there is a disadvantage in using
the word "rumor" too often. "Rumor" tends to dignify what might be
better designated in a deflating or ironic word--such as "phony". Most
rumors are phonies, and the flavor and pungency of the word "phony" can
serve as a potent weapon in fighting rumors.

The rumor-control project 
can help to reduce anxiety about certain kinds of rumors (especially
horror stories) by impressing people with the fact that
(a) certain rumors always spring up during the war and have no basis in
fact, (b) certain rumors flourished in earlier wars and were just as phony then as  now.
The rumor-control [project] groups will find it valuable to point out
whenever possible, that certain rumors are exactly like rumors which 
were also circulated (and were also false) during the last war, the 
Franco-Prussian War, the Civil War, etc.  End of IP
