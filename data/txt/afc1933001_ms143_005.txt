Dear Dr. Lomax: 
My associates and I are still doing some work on the Amish hymns 
and hymn tunes. We have just heard of a group in Iowa which may be 
willing to sing sixteen or seventeen tunes for us. I am writing to 
Professor Morris, Editor of the Southern Folklore Quarterly, to send 
me the issue which you suggested that I get in order to inform myself 
how we may be able to borrow a machine from your archive. 
Within the past few weeks our young friend at Northwestern University 
has learned of several new groups which may be willing to help us with 
some recordings. You may be interested to know that Professor J. W. 
Yoder, of Juniata College, at Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, has been notating 
some tunes in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, and that he hopes to have 
a number of them ready for publication in a small book within the next 
year. It may interest you to know that our friends who sang for you 
last April do not refuse to sing on account of any distrust of you, but 
because they were disciplined by the church for assisting in recording 
the tunes. 
We have made good use of the duplicate record which you sent me to be 
used at New York during the holidays. The head of our music department 
has notated them and I presume they will appear in the Journal of 
American Folklore in connection with my article on the Amish and [of]
their hymn tunes. 
Very sincerely yours, 
John Umble
