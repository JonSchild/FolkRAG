Cause I mean she jes [fell] feel mo of mysef than anything in the world
I mean she's me anyway.
I always said I don't think Huddie could-a took my death like I
could his'n.  He always said he couldn't.  He always said, "Well, I don't
wanna die first.  I wanna see after you.  But [O] I couldn't stand it.  I
think you could stand my death better'n I could stand yo'se.  I would
never live.  I know I wouldn't." I always said I don't think he could have
stood it either cause I know how he carried on when I was very sick.
An I'm sho if he takes sickness, jes low-sick, that hard, he'd take death
much harder.  When I was sick that time (in '43 when Martha almost died)
they had to leave him go from the Vangu[a]ard.  He couldn't stay there.
Everytime he'd start to playin he'd start to cryin.  So he jes had to
quit.  He quit for a whole week.  I was really sick, honey. I was jes dead
thass all.  It's one nurse was there in that place, in the ward, I forgit
huh name, everytime I go to de hospital I saw huh the other day, she
said, "I'll nevah, as long as I live, forgit your face.  You can walk in
this place twenty years from now an I'll now you like I know mysef.
You were the sickest human [n] ever I seed in my life[.] an still walkin
around."
