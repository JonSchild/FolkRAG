Tape: 891 Cont. Nimrod
AL: Do you sing any songs about feuds, or faction fights
in the mountains, feuding songs, do you know any of those-
like the Hatfields? Or didn't they have any of those when 
you were growing up?
Nimrod: No, they didn't... (cut) (then camera back on)
I took more people from New York around to that grave on
Island creek... It's in Rowan county... you can turn to
the right and it's... or that left road going down to
... mines? Now he's buried right there, 1/2 mile or more
near Sterrup (?) mines. I knew him, I knew them all.
And I know old Randall McCoy, back when they were having that
difference back in... Mountains. Them and their two boys,
dug a mudhole, the two boys got down in it. Looked right
at that... old Randall looked right at old Chap, said Chap
Hatfield, you might shoot me, but you'll shoot me right up
here. Said you'll not shoot me down in no mudhole, I
don't bother with beast nor man. Old Randall said boys,
take your guns up off 'em and give them a chance to get
their guns. It won't do to kill a man with that much
nerve, and him unarmed. I let 'em go... if he'd gotten
down on those boys, he kill'em... they both run...
(a few more lines of unusable stuff)
AL: Why do you suppose the mountain got into all this shooting?
