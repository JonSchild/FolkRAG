Perhaps you have wondered why I have aid so little, and that indefinite
and vague, about Haiti.  I have simply had to censor
my letters.  I am being watched here.  A misstep and I would land in the
nearest jail and go home on the quickest boat.  It is not impossible
that I shall be spied upon during my whole stay here.  All visitors,
especially mericans, are suspect because of the way Haiti had been
done up in yellow journalism.  The athorities live in fear and dread
that someone ill write another book about the Haitian voodoo cult.  Anyone
who expresses an opinion about the government or even about his personal
political belief is likely to be deported.  A Cummunist is next thing to
Devil.  I have been able to do absolutely nothing since my arrival
in the way of recording Haitian music.  In fact I have spent the whole of
eight days in negociations with the officials of this place, and you
know about how well I love to negotiate.  There are two classes in
Haiti.  The rich and their hangers-on; these people are generally mulatoes,
conkey joes or high browns; they have all the money, all the food, all the
priveledge, and feel free to treat the poor black peasant much more roughly
and pay him far worse wages than any Southern cracker ever dared to.
I saw a conkey joe slap a young Negro man this morning,
right out in the public thoroughfare, with a pop that reechoed for fifteen
yards.  The poor people are black, eighty percent illiterate, living close
to the earth like lizards, in mortal terror of the gendarmerie.  The upper
classes never have and never will do anything for this toiling feund mass.
Naturally they are nervous.  There is brewing now in this corrupt little
republic, whose fiscal affairs are straight for the first time in its history
because they are administered by and for the benefit of the National
City Bank of New York City which demands only a legitimate profit on
money lent and doesn't simply run off with the whole treasury at once as
the Haitians are accustomed to doing, there is brewing the prettiest
little Fascist revolution you ever saw.  It has the support of the intelligencia,
the efficient gendarmerie, and most of the officiant people
in Pourt-au-Prince.  I have been stumbling along half-blind in a next of lies
unaware most of the time that I was being watched.  The only person I have
said too much too is Polines and may the Lord help me if the police ever
get him in  the Haitian third degree room where not rubber hoses but good
substantial clubs are used and heads are unashamedly broken.  Zora is hard
enough to fathom all by herself and as uncertain and potentially violent
as she can be.  At first I was completely dependent on her and on top of that
was afraid she was in love with me.  Nothing has happened so far and now I
have made some friends of my own and am not so completely dependent on her
as I was at first.  But Godd I'll be glad when I breathe my last breath of
Port-au-Prince air and get out into the country where there is a little
more physical danger involved, but where the issue is simpler -- do the
people trust and like you or not?. . . I think my account is exaggerated.
but I am writing only what I am told and I want to impress upon you the
necessity of not talking about what I have written you and of being careful
about your letters, when and if you write.  Please tell Harold and my
other friends to tone their letters down to the most lily white they can
contrive. 
After almost four fours of writing I fell considerably better about you.
I really am sure inside myself that you love me and that what you wrote
me once, quoting an ancient, has not come to pass: "Love is
among those qualities which while more complete and full and at
