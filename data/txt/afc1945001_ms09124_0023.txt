Rumors

During times of war, when, no doubt, everything 
may mean a lot, certain people called spies can 
be very harmful to their enemy. A few words could 
be spoken, & spreaded, and later break up the 
morale of the people. Such things as " I heard 
that a ______ ship was sunk in the Paciffic; last
night," or "The American people are starving; lack
of food is their main problem." Some of these spies
went so far as to say "We kidnapped MacArthur."
A friend of yours might have been on that false
ship; mourning would have been unessential.
It is not a sin to believe, but have a good judgement
of things.
