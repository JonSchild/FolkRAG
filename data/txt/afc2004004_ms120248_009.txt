Damballa, an important Rada god whose symbol is the serpent,
is said to bring rain because they sing "Damaballa nan l'eau--Damalla in
the water."  The sacred color of this deity, worn by devotées under possession, 
is white, and the full initiates wear white necklaces as well as
white clothing.  This god, identified with St. Patric[k], is especially worshipped
on Thursdays, and shares the white fig-tree with Erzilie and Gran'
Siligbo.  Damballa "eats" sacrifices of white chickens and pigeons, rice,
milk, eggs, pineapples, and fig-bananas; and "drinks" kola and sweetened
coffee.  Damballa forms the rainbow, and this is called an arc d'alliance
between him and Aida Wedo, his wife, whose characteristic dress is black
and white.  Sobo, who in Dahomey is the god of thunder, is also believed
in Haiti to give thunder, though he is not thought to live in the sky.
As in Africa, his symbol is the ram.  Aizan lives in the water, and is a
favored deity because he gives his devotées the power of healing and of
divining.

Erizilie, a loa of considerable importance, is envisaged as a
pale, trembling woman who also inhabits the water.  She constantly changes
her dresses, of which she has many.  All agree that she is a fabulously
wealthy woman, who wears golden chains about her neck and has many rings,
a characterization derived from her identification with Mater Dolorosa,
whose chromolithographs depict her with many rich ornaments.  As a Rada loa
she "eats" the same food as Damballa, and wears white, like this other god,
but has Friday as her sacred day.  In her less pleasant manifestation of
Erzilie Gé Rouge, the red-eyed one, a member of the Pétro "squad", she is
held to be the wife of Simbi d'l'eau, with whom she is believed to get on
especially well, since they "eat" different foods.  Simbi, who is worshipped
on Tuesdays and inhabits the mango and calabash trees, is said to drink
