Dear Alan: 
I hope your neck is better, and I'm sorry for having put an extra pain 
in it by being so late with these contracts. 
As you well know, there are ten thousand details. 
I hope they are satisfactory. If you wish any changes made, call me 
at ALpine 4-8284 here in Asheville. 
We are delighted that you are going to be with us, and if you have any 
available publicity material and pictures, please be good enough to 
send us as many as you can spare. 
Thank you again for all your help. 
Yours sincerely, 
Jim
