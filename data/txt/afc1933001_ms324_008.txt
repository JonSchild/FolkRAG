THE OLD BRASS WAGON
A Southern Playparty Game

Tune:
(Recorded from Miss Anna Ball of Richmond by Richard Chase.)

Verses:
1.  Jolting up and down in the old brass wagon (3 times)
Early in the morning. (4th line is the same for all verses.)
2. Right to your partner and left to the next one.......
3. Rights and lefts in the old brass wagon...........
4. One wheel off and the other one a-draggin'........
5.  Reel all around in the old brass wagon............
(The reeling couple should have finished by this time)
6. We'll all run away in the old brass wagon.........

Formation:
Longways for 5, 6, or 7 couples. (See figure below)

TOP       0  0  0  0  0  0  (girls)      BOTTOM
               X  X  X  X  X  X  (boys)

Figures: (Easy-going WALKING STEP for all but verses 1 & 6.)
1.  First couple join hands straight across and go sideways ("Sashay")
down the middle, 8 counts, to the bottom where, on counts 7 & 8
they make a half-swing clockwise; and slip back to the top (8),
keeping changed places so that they are on "wrong" sides to start
the reel.
2.  THE REEL: 1st couple swing each other with a right elbow swing.
3. Then the boy goes straight to the next girl in line and swings
4. her with a left elbow swing while the 1st girl swings the next
5. boy also with a left elbow swing; then they swing each other again
RIGHT, and the next in line LEFT..... and so on until they swing
each one in the line and come to the bottom. When this reeling
couple gets to the bottom place they join hands straight across
and raise an arch between them, each now standing on the proper
side.
6. The couple left at the top, facing up, now turn away from each 
other and "cast off," the boy to his LEFT and the girl to her
RIGHT, and each line following, meet partners below the arch,
and return to places with a new couple at the top.
