CALVIN TOWNSHIP
Cass County

Settled in the last century by freed and escaped southern
slaves, the population of Calvin township in Cass county, Michigan,
remains almost exclusively negro.

Today most of the people are engaged in farming -- for themselves.
Respected, property owning folk, their manner of life is
a far cry from the degraded, servile existence led by their ancestors
during pre-Civil-war days.

In the spring of 1836, a Quaker preacher, Henry H. Way,
brought with him from Ohio, a fugitive slave by the name of Lawson.
As far as is known this was the first instance of a colored man
seeking asylum in Michigan from the persecution that runaway slaves
were subjected to, in the states further south. In 1838 a Guinea
negro, named Jesse Scott, arrived in Calvin township. The white
settlers, who were already in the township and in Penn township
just to the north, were largely of the Wuaker faith.

They were very much opposed to slavery and to the return of
fugitives to their masters. They encouraged and helped fugitives
and some of their homes became stations for the so-called "Underground
Railway" to Canada. Such sympathetic neighbors and the
fertile, cheap lands naturally turned the eyes of fugitives and
freed slaves, who were looking for a place to settle in a free
state, toward Calvin township.
