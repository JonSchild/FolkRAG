Adventures-Sheldon 6

The flames from the fireplace and one coal oil lamp furnished all the light,
a light that flickered and trembled from the wind creeping throught the cracks between the 
logs, perhaps from the music that throbbed through the cabin and seemed to sway the branches 
outside. It was a happy evening, and up in Washington Elmo Newcomer's music and calls 
live for other generations. I list the name of some of his tunes:

Cotton Eye Joe
Mabel -(-a Schottische)
Turkey in the Straw
Blue-eyed Susy
Rye Whiskey--"with capers"..(otherwise known as "The Drunken Hiccups")
Eph Caught a Rabbit
Wagner

So------- I found some compensation to offset ill-concealed sneers.

Admiral Byrd found "Home on the Range" cheering during his long, cheerless vigil
at the South Pole. I [pirated] printed the phrase "Git along, little dogies," immortalized and
unacknowledged in the deservedly popular "Last Round-Up."

But best of all,- a librarian once told me that he had bought forty copies of
Cowboy Songs: "The high-school boys stick them under their jackets and forget to bring
'em back."
