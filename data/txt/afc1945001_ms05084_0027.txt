"This selective service rule of single men first is a lot of
hooey. Why, a fellow in my office who is married and has three little kids
got his notice to appear for a physical, the other day. And I know a lot
of young single fellows who are still out, and they don't have any dependents
either. A couple of them work at the Remington plant, but they could be
replaced in a minute. Their jobs aren't technical." Salt Lake City 8-6 21
