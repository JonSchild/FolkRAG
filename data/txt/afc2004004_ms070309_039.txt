Old Time Religion
About 9 or 10 the first service
I remember. Denominations not so important. 
Entirely Negro church - Negro preacher -
a little country church - "box church" -
on the edge of the woods - it was a 
more purer hearted service , wasn't
all this note to sing, grammar not
so important - only some of the ministers
 could read - In Tunica an old 90 yr. 
minister, Preston Johnson, in '69 who
didn't know a letter in the book,
but could quote the scriptures exactly -
he'd have the Bible open, but he
couldn't read a note - we'd pray for 
the saving of their soul - not concerned
with the body - freedom not discussed -
