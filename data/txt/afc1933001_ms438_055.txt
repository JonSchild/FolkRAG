[Chorus] Chorus:*[*]
Take me back, babe,
Take me back,
I won' do nothin'
You don' like.**

Well, I went down,
O de T.P. line,
Jus' beggin' dat woman
Won't she be mine?

She said she would, babe,
If I'd be good. [babe]
She said she would,--
Treat her de bes' I could.

I went down
De T.P. line,
Tryin' to change
Dat woman's min'.

O she turned aroun'
Some two, three times.
"I love you, woman,
Don' you want to be mine?"

"Take[n] me back, babe,
Take me back,
I won' do nothin'
You don' like."


** [Insert] Sing the chorus, Lead belly suggests just as often as you feel
like it.
*Pronounced nearly [as "lak".] "lack."
