Dear Mr. Lomax:

I wrote to you some time ago about a collection of
workers songs that we are compiling. It is to include both
old and new songs in the various fields of:

Folk Songs
Labor Songs
Anti-War Songs
Political Songs

I am writing to you in the hope that you are able
to make such songs available to us or you know where they
could be obtained. Also, the background, different versions
of the same song, or other related information will help
greatly in compiling them in a more intelligent manner.

Your co-operation in permitting us to use the songs
that you have (especially your own) or information as to wehre
we can get such material, will certainly be appreciated.

Very truly yours,
Joseph Arnstein
