year has been made possible through
the cooperation and support
of the Historical Records Survey,
under the direction of
Dr. Luther Evans; and of the Federal
Writers Project headed
by Mr. Henry G. Alsberg. In

for these two Federal Surveys
I was permitted to stop occasionally
and make records
The grateful thanks of the Music Division are tendered them.
[I spent my entire vacation
in this service for the Archive.]
