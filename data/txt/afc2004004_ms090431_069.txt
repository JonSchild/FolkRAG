Fisk, 14. 5. WILL STARK.

Loving wife, kind,
Kind and always be,
What man is that in the bedthere
Where I used to be?

You fool, you blind,
Blind and never could see;
It's nothin at all but a doll-baby
[*l:] Y[o]ur mammy sent to me. [:l*]

I travelled ten tho sand miles,
Travelled ten thousand mo;
I never befo seen a doll-baby
With whiskers on befo.

A: What was the end of that [S]story? Did he shoot her or not?
S: I don't know.
A: Who did you learn that from?
S: I think I learned that from banjo-pickers a long time ago.

USE OF DOPE IN LUMBER CAMPS
I say, "Who all use cocaine on this job?" We went to Lambeth once; 
if you want to know, you just buy some and get it there. They buy 
from you; they buy allthey can get.
I said, "How does it take effe[f]ct on you? Does it take like whiskey?"
He said, " Yes, it makes you fell better'n whiskey." (laughter). And 
he said all the people here on this yard excusing three or four fellows
that just come here lately. And I never did see none but once when I
was working with them. He said he was goin to find out whoe used it.
And he bought it in Lambeth and showed it to me, carried it out on the
job. But I never did see nobody use it; I seen folks acting funny.
They say the fellows wou[d]ld get drunk and they couldn't smell any whiskey.
A: Well, did these people have trouble quitting it [after] if they wanted 
to?
S: They said they couldn't quit it; after you get started, it was a
habit, and you couldn't quit it. You'd go crazy if they couldn't get
it.
