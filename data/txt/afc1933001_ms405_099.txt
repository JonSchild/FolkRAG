ALEX MOORE*

1. Come all young boys and listen to my tale,
I'll tell you bout travellin' up the Lone Star Trail.

Chorus
Singin' ti yi youpy, youpy ya, ya, ya.
Singin' ti yi youpy, youpy ya.

2. I was comin' cross the ridge in a cowboy's rush.
It went like a hurricane a-goin' through the brush.

Chorus

3. I waved my lasso round over my head,
The horses all poor and the cattle all dead.

4. The horses all poor and the cattle all dyin'
Just a comin' down the road a-taggin' and a-flyin'.

5. I'll hang up my old saddle, bridle and rope:
The horses all so poor they can't strike a lope.
(Making a short lose--a botch or break
in a song.)

OLD JOE CLARK, ALEX MOORE

Old Joe Clarks the meanest man that ever was made,
Stole a yaller gal from the South and followed the Yankee trade.

Chorus
Walk, walk old Joe Clark
Hoora Betty Brown
Walk, walk old Joe Clark
I'm goin' to leave this town.

I went down to old Joe Clark's,
He was sick and in the bed.
Run my finger down his throat,
Pulled out a chicken head.

*Ain't no number to it. It
just keeps a-goin' on. Said
of stanza in Old Chisholm Trail
