1) Sir John Cope rode the North right far
Yet ne'er a rebel he come nor,
Until he landed at Dunbar
Richt early in the morning.
Chorus:
Hey Johnny Cope are ye walking yet
Or are your drums a-beating yet?
O why do you fly like a frighted crow
That's awa to it's nest in the morning.
2) Cope wrote a challenge frae Dunbar
Saying fight me Charlie, gang ye dar,
If it be no but the chance of war
I'll gie ye merry mourning.
3) When Chairlie looked the letter upon
He drew his sword the scabbard from,
Come follow me, my merry, merry men,
And we'll meet Johnny Cope in the morning.
4) Noo, Johnny, be as gaed's your word,
Come, let us try baith fire and sword,
And dinna run like a frichted bird
That's chased from it's neat in the morning.
5) When Johnny Cope he heard O' this,
We thought it wouldna be amiss
Tae have a horse in readiness
Tae flee awa' in the morning.
6) Fie now, Johnny, get up and run
Our hieland bagpipes make a din,
It's best tae sleep wi' a hale good skin
For 'twill be a bloody morning.
7) Cope swore wi' mony a bleedy word
That he would fight them gun and sword,
But he flew frae his nest like a frichted bird
Aye, Johnny he did wing in the morning.
8) When Johnny saw the hieland lads
Wi'  tartan trews and white cockades,
Wi' swords and guns and rings and gourds
O, Johnny he took winh in the morning.
9) Sir John Cope into Barwick rade
Just as the de'il had been his guide,
Gie him the world, he wouldn've stayed
To've fought the boys in the morning.
