In order to win this war
everyone should do his part.
There is a lot of things that
everyone could do to win this
war. You should buy a lot of
War bonds and stamps, do not
hord any kind of food, do not
buy things that you don't need,
do not buy more than what you 
need and do not spend your money
foolish because you can be buying
War bonds and stamps. You should
not waste any food material, or
greece. Because if you waste anything
you will be helping our enemies.
You should save as much greece as
you can because that will help
us build more ships and planes.
So lets all try to do our best to
win this war.
