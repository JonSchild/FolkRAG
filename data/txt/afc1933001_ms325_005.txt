You and the Next Administration
Continued from page 13

tion of Labor, at their winter meeting
in Miami, issued a statement that indicated
their realization that slack times
are directly related to mounting taxes.
Here is a remarkable table that confirms
their apprehensions so far as the building
trades are concerned. Utica, New
York, is a typical city of 100,000. Note
how the building of new houses has gone
down as the tax rate has gone up:

Year               Tax Rate      New Houses
1929                 $24.38              110
1930                    31.48                 87
1931                    31.04                 80
1934                    31.41                  27
1936                   33.38                    26
1937                     33.65                32
1938                    36.38                  14

   In justice to the New Dealers it should 
be said that the local-tax burden was
becoming a menace to the homeowner
even in the "good old days." For the past
twenty-five years we Americans have 
sailed along in the sublime assurance
that this is "the richest country in the
world," that there is no limit to the public
luxuries it can afford. Each new 
administration of a city or state has
promised more "improvements"; every
township has competed with its neighbors
as to which will have the finest high
school, the biggest city hall, the grandest 
post office, the most miles of new 
roads. The New Deal did not invent 
governmental extravagance. It merely
took a widespread American disease and
made it a thousand times worse.

Figures that Mean Failure

   The federal budget for 1940, as transmitted
to Congress by the President in 
January, weighs four pounds and eleven
ounces. This is only seven ounces more
than the weight of the 1933 budge, but
the increase of 7 ounces in seven years
represents about $714,287,142 an ounce.
In those hundreds of pages of figures is
written the failure of the philosophy of
spending. Spending has not primed the 
pump of private enterprise to the point
of prosperous operation. It has not reduced
notably the number of the unemployed.
It has not raised the price of 
farm products. It has not achieved any
of the objectives that were claimed for
it. But it has cut nearly in half the interest 
on your savings account.
   It has practically wiped out the dividend
on your insurance policy.
   It has made your home a poorer investment,
harder to sell.
   It has built up on a debt that is not only 
a first lien on your future earnings, but
is taking its toll of every dollar you earn 
or spend today.
   Now let us see what will happen to 
you under the next President who, according
to the best political judgment at 
the moment, will be either Mr. Roosevelt
or a Republican.
   Mr. Roosevelt will continue to spend
and increase the national debt. This he
has announced. He is trying to allay
your fears by adopting two ingenious 
arguments.
   First, he says that no matter how big
the debt becomes it is not a menace because
it is owned by Americans, and 
they will be paying the interest on it to
each other. That is the same as saying
that if you and I are fellow residents of
Dubuque, and you owe me $1,000, you
shouldn't worry because we both live in
the same town. But the fact remains 
that I am collecting the interest, and
you are paying the interest, and eventually
you will have to pay the principal.

   Every ruler in history who has run his
country into debt has resorted to clever
sophistries. Finally, however, the debt
has become too heavy for the debtors
to bear. They have had to default on
the interest, whereupon the bonds have
tumbled in price, the government credit
has collapsed, and chaos has descended.
   All citizens suffer under such a calamity,
but the weak and poor suffer most. 
The United States is a rich country. Its hour
of retribution will, therefore, be 
delayed, perhaps for many years; but no
amount of charming fireside talk can 
postpone it forever.
   Second, we are offered the beguiling
expedient of the so-called "double
budget." The argument is that the regular
governmental expenses should be
put in one column, and the expenditures
for new post offices, courthouses, sewer
systems, and the rest should not be considered
as constituting a deficit, since 
these are "permanent improvements."
Can the government sell a post office, a
courthouse, or a sewer system and use
the proceeds to retire the bonds that 
were issued to construct it? Obviously
not. The bonds must ultimately be met
by taxation. And whether you carry
them in a "normal budget" or an "investment
budget," they are debt and 
nothing but debt, and paying them off 
will just be as hard.
   When responsible government officials,
who spent the first five years of
their administration deploring deficits
and promising a balanced budget, turn
a complete somersault and begin to defend
deficits and think up engaging 
reasons to convince the voters that they
are not really deficits at all, the beware.
You may know that the time is
not far off when they may levy on the
principal of your savings, just as their
policies have already levied on the interest.
   Now turn the picture around. Suppose
the miracle happens. Suppose, in
spite of all the money that will be
available in the campaign, and all the 
pleas put forth by the most attractive
and persuasive radio voice in political
history, the common sense of the voters
rebels and a Republican President is 
elected. What will the new administration 
do? And how will you fare
under it?
   My belief is that a Republican administration,
if it is to do you any
permanent good, must completely reverse
the traditional pattern of our political
history. Almost universally the

{{column break}}

rule has been that an administration is
most popular in its first six months, the
so-called "honeymoon," and proceeds to 
grow increasingly unpopular until it is
turned out by accumulated resentment
and the desire for change. The Republican
administration of 1941 ought to
make itself increasingly unpopular in
the first eighteen months. It must have 
the courage to tell unpleasant truths,
enact unpopular legislation, and say
"No, No, No." Every act and every No
will make somebody sore, including 
many of its own supporters.

Some Unpleasant Jobs

    Without going into detail, let us list 
a few of the unpleasant truths it ought 
to tell, and the unpopular actions it
ought to take:
   Our tax system is all wrong. The government
is now collecting sixty-one
cents in tax revenue for every dollar of
expenditure. Ten cents of the sixty-one
cents is in the form of income taxes,
which are paid by only four per cent of
the people. This four per cent is
acutely conscious of the effects of governmental
extravagance. The other
fifty-one cents of national revenue is
taken away from the rest of the people
in the form of indirect or hidden taxes,
of which they are not so conscious. The
next administration ought to move 
courageously to repeal deterrent and indirect
taxes, and to broaden the income-
tax base and lower the exemptions, as
many students of national economy
have suggested. This will make many
millions conscious of the cost of government,
and it will temporarily, at least,
make them resentful.
   The farm program is subject to all the
criticisms that were leveled at Mr. Hoover's
little half-billion-dollar Farm
Board; only in the present instance the
cost of failure totals many billions.
There are more farmers than the nation
needs. The most efficient should be
allowed to raise food as economically as
possible and sell it to the people in the 
cities at the lowest prices consistent
with a reasonable profit. The less successful
producers on a marginal lands
should be helped to find their way into
reforestation, flood control, or any one
of a dozen activities that would contribute
to the national welfare.
   Specifically, the cotton situation is
getting steadily worse. Foreign markets
had begun to shrink even before the
New Deal; but New Deal policies of
