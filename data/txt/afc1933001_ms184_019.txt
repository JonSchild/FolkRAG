Chief of the Music Division
To the Librarian

July 9, 1942

The proposed schedule of allotments for 1942-1943 contains an item
of $2,000 for the Archive of American Folk-Song. In 1941-1942, the Music
Division was allotted $15,000 for recording in general so that the pro-
posed allotment would practically eliminate recording from the Division's
list of activities. I believe this cut to be excessive and shall attempt to
justify this belief by a description of the types of recording activities
which seem to me important during the war period.

1.  The recording of radio speeches by high government officials as 
well as certain war broadcasts is an exceedingly important form of
historic documentation. As far as I can tell, no government agency is
attempting to record this material in systematic fashion. The National
Archives is prevented by law from making any original recordings and must
rely entirely on gifts from radio stations, a procedure which will
hardly produce a representative collection.

2.  During the past six months, it has become increasingly apparent
that the men in the armed services are creating a significant body of
songs of a folk and popular nature which is not receiving the attention
it deserves. It has been any hope that the Library would play an important
role in the preservation of such material by sending recording expedi-
tions to the military and naval posts. These records would not only be of
historical significance but the Army might be interested in disseminating
copies of them for purposes of morale.

3.  I am not inclined to allow the Archive of American Folk-Song to
adhere to its past policy in organising recording expeditions for the dura-
tion of the war. Such expeditions should now be limited to the acquisi-
tion of material directly connected with war projects. For instance, we
expect another appropriation from the Inter-Departmental Committee for
the preparation of albums of phonograph records for exchange with Latin-
American institutions and although we already have enough material for
dozens of albums, it may prove advisable to record a few new ones for this
purpose.

For the purposes outlined above, I recommend that the allotment for
recording be increased from $2000 to $12,000 if at all possible. Such
an allotment seems modest for the projects described in this memorandum.

Respectfully submitted,

Harold Spivacke
