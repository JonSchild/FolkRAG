Reverend Roe.  Reel 5.  P. 5
R: Common, just as common. 
A: You mean, they were always running after the [Negroes] colored folks down there..
R: Oh yeah, they was always something [they did going on] - they'd go round. Then [had] heard a
colored person, you know, doing anything wrong or practicing any-
thing, they'd go round with that crowd and they'd [caught] call him out and warn him and
tell [him what] do him what they [gaming] wanted to do, and give him a warning, and then look
in sometime.
A: Was that the Ku Klux? They didn't wear robes?
R: No, they called [them] um Ku Klux, but they werent nothing by mobs..
A: They didn't wear ay disguise; they did it right out in the open.
R: No, no disguise.
A: Was there a time there when the Negroes voted right a fter the
Civil War?
R: Oh yeas, we voted, yes sir, yes sir! [They] We voted, [up until the] went to the
[*Negro voters*]
election many time, and those fellows would be looking and raising
Cain [than] a little and they'd be hollering this, that, and the other, and all the
colored people were Republican. If you told a colored
fellow, you was a Democrat, it meant afight. I remember on one
occasion there was an old man at my home -- he wasa terrible man
with his fists -- he would knock the bark off of a tree with his
fists. And his name was Scribe, Old Man Scribe, and Old Man Nero
[*All Republicans*]
was his [name] neighbor. One occasion after the election Old Man Nero came
by Old Man Scribe's house. He was mad, but we didn't know what
about. So he called him, [he] called Old Man Scribe, [and this] Here's Old
Man Nero, [said] "says" Come out here. I want to see you." He walked out.
"What do you want?" He says, "I heard you told the folks round here
I voted the Democratic ticket [for middle the] a middling of meat.." [But he] And I didn't
say it."
