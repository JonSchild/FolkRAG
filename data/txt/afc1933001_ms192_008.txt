My dear Alan:-

Your letter made me very happy.
My idea, when I make a little gift, 
is to give because I want to, and 
enjoy doing it, and not because I want 
or expect anything in return. I buy
and sell yarns for knitting, so the cost 
in money was nothing to amount to anything,
and it made me happy to do it 
for you because you and your friends
had been so nice to me. I suppose it 
is laughable, when one thinks of it, that 
I should feel happier and more at [hope] home
at the Library of Congress, right in the 
Nations Capital, than in the sitting room
of my neighbor, but so it is.

I have some nets out among 
relatives from Dan to Beersheba,
