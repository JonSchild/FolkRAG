The Bishop of the Church of God 
whose tabernacle stands on Jefferson 
St., is a [so] mounful walrusy yellow old
man - wears white shirt and low 
white collar & black frock coat
as do his other ministers. Said that
he was worried about my questions because a
German spy had been around a few
months ago.
The pianist is a big lolloping yellow
Negro - prof Saggs - principal of local
high school - entertained us all afternoon 
with tales of Church of God & its
branches. Holiness movement spontaneous
generalized revolt of Baptist ministers
in various places in the '90's that
coalesced as the Church of God - Negro &
white: Doctrine of real or actual sin. You
really had to give up sin [as well] instead of 
just saying so. Numerous splits. Church

Bishop Mason, now the largest Holiness
