Dear Irene,
It is sometime since we have corresponded. In
the interim I understand you have arranged for the publication
of your study of Acadian songs. I hope this
rumor turns out to be true and I should like to know
more about the venture. Since I wrote you last, I have 
been on an extensive field trip to Michigan( where, by
the way, I recorded a lot of fine Canadian-French material),
have spent a half-year of graduate study in Columbia
University and am now helping father finish another
ballad book. 
In it we plan to print ten or fifteen Cajun
ballads and among these "J'ai m'ai fait une maitresse
trois jours, mais c'est pas longtemps." I suppose you
recall that this ballad was not complete on the record, 
the last words being ---
Je me mettrai mari, mari----.
I have not been able to find this ending in any of the
books I have seen and wondered whether you had ever
found the conclusion for it. If so, would it be too much
to ask that you send me the reference or the quotation,
itself? Have you ever seen Elida or her father, Julien
Hofpauir? ... I should add that if you can give
me the date, publisher, title of your thesis I should 
like to plug it in the book. I have mentioned it
already in my note but without title. My best regards to
