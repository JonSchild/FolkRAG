COMPANY "D" MARCHING SONG
(Far, Far Away)

Around her hair she wore a purple ribbon,
She wore it in the springtime and in the month of May
And if you ask her why the hell she wore it--
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
Far away (Far away) -- Far away (Far away)
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.

Around her thigh she wore a purple garter;
She wore it in the springtime and in the month of May.
And if you ask her why the hell she wore it--
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
Far away (far away) Far Away (far away)
She wore it for a Raider man who's far, far away.

Around the block she pushed a baby carriage;
She pushed it in the springtime and in the month of May.
And if you ask her why the Hell she pushed it--
She pushed it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
Far away (far away) Far away (far away)
She pushed it for a Raider man who's far, far away.
