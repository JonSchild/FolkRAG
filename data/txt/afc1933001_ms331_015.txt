I got up the next morne
to catch another train a
pint of licker under each
arm no spirte to restrain
I got dead drunk and ful
a shep some filler broke
my you I rode that day
and they punched me [?]
rite back in state of
Ark-saw.

No I am down in
Florida no cone break are
no chills They dont feed on
sasafrace tea nor old
corn doger meals if you
ever see me there again
I will offer you my
paw But it will be a 
through telescope from
here to ark saw.
