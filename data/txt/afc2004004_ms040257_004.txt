(Skye. contd.)

CALUM MACLEAN (contd.)

people came up from London to photograph - spent 
days photographing him.  They began to wonder then - 
there must have been something in the stories by Angus
MacMillan - telling stories.  I remember someone 
telling me that an old woman disappeared one night.
She went to the well to get a pail of water.  It was 
seven o'clock on a winter evening.  By midnight she 
had n't reappeared. So a search party was sent out.
They found her in the house where Angus MacMillan was 
telling a story.  That was something quite usual. 
Often when Angus MacMillan came into a house at night
people waited there all night.  People came in to see
him for two or three minutes and waited there all that 
day until early the following morning.  Sometimes 
search parties were sent out for them.  Well, all 
these stories have been recorded I think. 

LOMAX:  What about [happened] when he would start stories 
late at night? 

CALUM MACLEAN: Yes, too late at night sometimes he would start
threatening that he was going to start a story at 
midnight...so it was very difficult to...If you 
go there, Alan, go there early in the morning, not 
late at night.
