[over] Texas Christian University at 
Ft Worth. Prospects at one or two 
places though I wont know until 
next week. Tomorrow I 
am going to Austin to see what 
may be done [there]a at the University, 
returning perhaps via A. & M. I'd
like to see you tackle that 
grand bunch of wild yahoos.

I hope you wont get irritated
at my frequent notes.
Let me indulge my fancy 
if you can.

Even Johnny with a bran 
new business on his hands and 
also an engrossing love experience fails 
[of] in his accustomed regularity. Mrs
Josiah Combs, that charming French 
lady wished to be remembered to you.
Affectionately, 
Father.
