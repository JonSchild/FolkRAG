Mr. Charles B. Elam,
2709 Sherman Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Elam:
You may be wondering what has become of the
records you sent me some time ago.
I have been away from New York and therefore
have not been able to return them to the Library as soon as I
had hoped. I have prepared four of the six programmes and I
am leaving in a few hours to catch an airplane to South America
and it will be another month before I will be back and able to
complete the series. There is one advantage in this: I will
be able to hear from  London as to the songs they liked best
and may be able to repeat their favourites in the last two programmes.
I will quite understand, however, if you would
like to have the records back. They are at present being most
carefully looked after in special containers and no possible
damage can come to them, but it may be possible that the Library
feels that I have had them long enough. If that is so, I will
be only too glad to return them. There are eighteen that I was
planning to use in the last two programmes which I will prepare
as soon as I return from South America at the end of December.
Will you be kind enough therefore, to let me know: (A) Whether
you require all of the records back now? (B) Whether you would
like the records I have already made use of returned and only
those retained that I shall make use of in the last two programmes,
or (C) Whether I may retain all the records for another few weeks?
I hope this may be possible without inconvenience to you as it will
enable me - as I said above - to know the numbers which British listeners
particularly enjoyed.
I am writing this letter to you in accordance with
the arrangement that I was to keep you informed about these records
during Mr. Lomax's absence. If Mr. Lomax is back now (or his son)
perhaps you would be kind enough to show him this letter and let him
know what the position is. Perhaps you would be kind enough to write
