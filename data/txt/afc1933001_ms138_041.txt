Dear Mr. Lomax,
My addressing you will not
seem much crazier, I fear, than

& claim to have heard it. When a child 
have asked for a copy if I find 
it. One man gave me the enclosed
which I am sure is not
correct, but may serve as a clue
to the tale. Some versions I 
have heard give The conversation
as taking place between the
old woman and the
dead man -- but the enclosed
is the only version that I have
been able to get that gives more
