6.
Now in Scarbory church yard where this couple now lay,
And on the tombstone these words there do say,
"Come all you feeling lovers, as you pass by this way,
Look down on this poor couple, together now lay."

That's Scarborough town.
D. Kennedy: That's very nice.
Kennedy: What was the name of the ship, Harry?
Cox: Never heard that. Scarborough town, an' that's all I know of it.
That's where they were buried. They tell me you can see it on the
stone today. These blokes here what go a-fishin'. That is true. I've
heard 'em say it is on the stone there; I don't know whether
it's right.
Kennedy: Well, it sounds as though it was made on a true story.
doesn't it?
Cox: Yeah. Well, that's how that - that's how that go.
D. Kennedy: They were cast ashore on Robin Hood's - on a lee shore
on Robin Hood's Bay.
Cox: Yeah. They were sailin' on Robin Hood's Bay, A gale come
down upon them, an' dismal was the day.
Kennedy: Good gracious.
Cox: I don't know whether it's true or not. I heard - I've heard
talk about it - they might have put a lie at me perhaps.
D. Kennedy: It's a terrible place in a storm.
Kennedy: Gosh, you carry some wrecks in your head.
Cox: (laughs)
Kennedy: That's a terrible story, isn't it?
