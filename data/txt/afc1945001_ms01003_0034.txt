RUMOR ANALYSIS    2.

1. The Rumors
To report them in their vernacular form or forms, to 
find out who is circulating them, reporters or listening 
posts are indicated. There are probably more rumors in big 
cities of mixed populations than in smaller cities. New 
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington probably hatch and 
spread more rumors than other cities.

An interview technique must be devised which will lead 
the respondent to produce the rumor without asking him for
it and which, in addition, will indicate who told it to the
respondent. Interviews in one or several cities should be
planned among representative samples in accordance with the 
population of each city in which the investigation is undertaken.

Your suggestion on the investigatory procedures best 
suited to the solution of this aspect of the problem are 
earnestly requested.

2. The People: How are their opinions affected by rumors?

Tying the problem down to the people and their opinion 
formation as a result of rumors they have heard suggests some 
type of panel technique which will permit continuous or repeated 
observation of the same individuals checking their 
alterations in attitude again known rumor circulation to 
which they have been exposed. The purpose of such an investigation 
(as differentiated from the investigation of the rumors 
suggested above) would be to determine what types were susceptible 
to rumors, what types are not; what types of rumor most 
influenced opinion, what types least. This second phase of 
the problem may not be worth going into, or may possibly be 
combined with the investigation of the rumors themselves. 
Again, the suggestions and advice of Drs. Stanton, Cottrell 
and Franzen are requested.
