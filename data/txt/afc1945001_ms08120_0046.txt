Jokes...One day some friends had gathered
at my house. When to our surpise three
sailor friends of ours came over. We wasn't 
expecting them until Sunday. We talked about
different things and played cards. then
one of the sailors said My I use your
head. I looked at him funny and said
are you kidding. then he said excuse
me. May I use your toilet.
