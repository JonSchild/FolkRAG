Two Germans were driving along
a road and they ran over a little 
dog. They stopped and the one 
went into the farmhouse.
When he came back out again,
his arms were loaded down 
with cheese, bread, and all
sorts of food. When the German
who had remained in the car asked where the other one
got these things; he replied, that he went up to the door and said, "Heil Hitler! The
dog is dead," and they gave the things to him. 

Favorite saying of the Americans is "The Rising Sun is shinking fast."
