Rumor

A rumor is a report of something that is not true.
One is, The Peoples in the United States are starving. They are dying by thousands  every day.  The
President of the United States is dead.  We sent
all the soldiers to others countries to fight.  We
are not preparing for the war.  We do not care
about the war.  We are not buying war stamps.  We
are not rations any things.  Every thing is still like
it was before the war.
