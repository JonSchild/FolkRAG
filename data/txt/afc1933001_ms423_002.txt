                                                               SONGS
LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING                    
                                                                                Or dark or light, or wrong or right,
Lift every voice and sing                                     The world is made, is made by you.
Till earth and heaven ring                                   Or dark or light, or wrong or right,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty.                 The world is made, is made by you.
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies,                                   Thon rise as you no'er rose before,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.           nor hoped before, nor dared before,
Sing a song, full of the faith that                  And show as no'er was shown before
         the dark past has taught us.                    The power that lies, that lies in you.
Sing a song full of the hope that the                 
         present has taught us.                                 Stand all as one, see justice done,
Facing the rising sun                                           Believe and dare, and dare and do.
Of a new day begun,                                              Stand all as one, see justice done!
Let us march on till victory is won.                   Believe and dare, and dare and do!

Stony the road we trod,                                              ____________________________

You hold the whole world in your hand,        Chorus:
See to it what you do, you do.
