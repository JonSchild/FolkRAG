Tape: #227 Sacred Harp p.4

[*Music Lesson +++*]
(Mr.R.): a balanced key, we like it. Uncle Tom Denson always
said "If you don't like this type of music you better
keep away from it, because if you hang around it too
much it'll get a hold of you and you can't get away
from it" That was one of his pet slogans. [*14:56 min*]
Now this part here is the tenor, and that is the third
staff from the top. This is treble, it's the first
staff. This is also, the second staff, and this is
bass. These two parts are sung by male and female.
This gives you an extra octave. This man here is
singing in one octave, and she's singing in another
octave. And the same way in treble. Here we got male
and female and we automatically got two octaves.
This gives us a six-part harmony, whereas in church
music or in conventional music you got all ladies
singing soprano, all men singing baritone, bass..and 
alto by girls, and bass by boys..or men: that way you
only got 4-part harmony, because you don't have your
parts doubled. We're gonna start off with some leaders
that hadn't been leading before. Where's Philip? He
told me he wanted to be the first leader...you come and
first.... Remember that your time is beat down, and up --
and not a winding or snatching time -- it's beat down,
regularly and distinct in common time and compound time;
in triple time it's down, down and up. OK, page 111.
"Journey Home." Now your time always starts with your
hand up: then you go down, and up, down, and up.

All Sing: "Fa, sol, la,...."

Mr.R: Alright, when you get ready to sing your words, let 'em
know that you're ready, say "Words!" Here we go!
