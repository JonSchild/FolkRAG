F.N. Female

Why is it that the Negroe solieder 
who does something great in the fighting
for our country never is made known.

When a White soldier does something 
his name is always put in headlines
in the paper and usually his picture
in the newsreel in the moving 
picture but a Negroe soldier does not 
get any publicity whatever? Because 
of predjudices.

Why is it that we are trying to 
fight against Hitlerism and we 
do not fight against Jim Crowism? 

Why is it that a White person always 
looks at the bad side of Negroes and
does not look at the good side of 
him? 

Why is it that a White solieder  
does not want to salute to a high
ranking officer of the Negroe race?

Why is it that everybody regardless of 
race, creed, or color can't eat in 
anywhere they want to?
