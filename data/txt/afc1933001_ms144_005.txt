     The reason I have not sent you any catalogues
with marked numbers has been that the more catalogues
I have looked at the more I have felt that we should
get everything that we can lay our hands on.  The out-
put of the commercial companies in the field of folk and
semi-folk music has been for the past fifteen years
simply amazing.  Further I thought at the time I wrote you
last that, bu going through the records completely
I could at the one time a) estimate accurately what the
companies had already done b) order our material on
the basis of some selective categories (rather than pure-
ly by title) c) tell both Hammond, Taylor and Wallerstein
what they could further do both on the air and in re-
cording trips.  I had established the first few couple
of hundred cards of a catalogue system, by artist, ad
expected with NYA help to collate with a title index
and all the biographical and geographical material I 
could dig out of the files.  I had also planned to get
as much material on sales figures, bu year, by type,
by content and by singer along the way so that the basis
would be laid for a really intelligent study of American
[tasts] taste.
     My visit to Bridgeport naturally discouraged me
a good deal and when I learned that there were as many
as 76 active companies producing records in America in
the twenties and that at one time their annual output
was something like three hundred millions platters a 
year, I decided that [I was] my plan was a little ambitious.
      What I plan to do, therefore, is to play through
the current catalogues of Decca, Vocalion and Bluebird (if
you can arrange a trip to Camden for me later) and supple-
ment this with visits to Hammond's collection and those
next to be done.  If, however, you want to write Wallerstien
at once, my opinion is that the commercial recording comp-
anies have done a broader and more interesting job of
recording American folk music that the folk lorists and
that every single item of recorded American, rural, race
and popular material that they have in their current lists
and plan to release in the future should be in our files.
     Next week I will call on Jack Capps of Decca and
try to get an answer from him in regard to placing the
Music Division on the mailing list.  In addition I shall
b3e ready to ask Musicraft to give us their material ---
and they have some very fine stuff.  I should also like to
go to Bloomfield's and see what they have of their formerly
large stock of Paramount releases.  As you may know, Para-
mount was the first big 'race' company in the country and
since its emise ther has never been such another group 
of 'race' recordings.
