Home On The Range

Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam,
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where never is heard a discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Home, home on the range, 
Where the deer and the antelope play,
Where never is heard a discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

How often at night when the heavens are bright,
With the light of the glittering stars,
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed,
If their glory exceeds that of ours.
