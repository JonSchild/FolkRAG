No.  18  When the Saints Go Marching In 

When the sun refuses to shine, 
When the sun refuses to shine; 
Dear Lord, I want to be in that number, 
When the sun refuses to shine. 

CHORUS 

When the saints go marching in, 
When the saints go marching in; 
Dear Lord, I want to be in that number,
When the saints go marching in. 

2 

When the moon turns into blood,
When the moon turns into blood; 
Dear Lord, I want to be in that number, 
When the moon turns into blood. 

3 

When they crown Him King of kings, 
When they crown Him King of kings; 
Dear Lord, I want to be in that number, 
When they crown Him King of kings. 

4 

When they gather around the throne, 
When they gather around the throne; 
Dear Lord, I want to be in that number, 
When they gather around the throne.

5 

While the happy ages roll, 
While the happy ages roll; 
Dear Lord, I want to be in that number, 
While the happy ages roll.
