(Hat)  take that scrubber and wash off,  and then we'd sweep her over on the
dirt yard out there,  and that was the only kind of broom we had to do 
anything with back then.  And over here is one of those toys that we had
to play with,  it's not   (unint.)  I don't know... And right here's the
whimmy diddle ...  (tchnecial) ...  and here's  the whimmydiddle now
and this is the was you play with it  (plays)  (technical).... And here's 
the whistle.   When you need help, you get this whistle out of your pocket,

(she blows it).  And here's a cat yoke,  what they yoked up the cats with.

Stan:   Now this is what they'd put on the cats,  you know,  they'd put this

he'd give us a pretty good whoopin' off of it.

time,  so that's what we used then.      (technical)... (OK,  other ones...)
Hat:  This is a  "jumpin' jig",  it's a little old man,  he jumps.. ladders.
