Dear Ben:

I have been trying to get up to Washington for some
time and now it looks like I am going to make it next week.
As might be expected, I want to spend a lot of time in the
Archive. Will it get into your hair too much if I drop
by on Tuesday morning, February 1st, for a talk?

I will see you then,

Best wishes,
Bess
