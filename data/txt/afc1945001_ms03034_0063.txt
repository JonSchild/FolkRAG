the O. W. I. has recently instituted. The basic logic of this
approach is that if facts are available and complete, rumors
will have no room to thrive. The second type of program
deals with rumor and gossip generally. These may be adapted
to dramatic presentation and can serve to illustrate the
ridiculousness, dangers, and menace of rumor in time of war.
Considerable caution, however, must be exercised to exclude
the possibility that rumors may actually be spread by broadcasting
them over the radio. For this reason, the O. W. I.
councils against "rumor clinics" on the air.

(6) Speaking staff.

Since April of this year, the Massachusetts Committee on
Public Safety has included among its speakers persons qualified
to talk on rumor and propaganda. These speakers appear
before all manner of organizations, discuss current rumors,
illustrate the dangers of rumor, and admonish audience
against spreading rumors. Although such a speakers bureau
reaches only a small audience, it is more effective than many
other devices enumerated here.

(7) Morale Wardens, Neighborhood Consultants, etc.

Morale Warden is the designation given to a group of
about 300 representative citizens in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts appointed by the Division of Propaganda Research
to aid in its work. Their prime duty is to report
all rumors. In this capacity they constitute a listening network
which is invaluable. In addition they serve as a public
opinion panel and aid in the distribution of pamphlets and
posters designed to combat rumor. Somewhat similar are the
so-called Neighborhood Consultants of the city of Cambridge.
These selected persons were given an intensive course by
Harvard psychologists and then organized to serve a variety of
functions, including the reporting and squelching of rumors.

(8) Feature stories.

This type of publicity is illustrated by the article
appearing in the Reader's Digest of September 1942 entitled
Boston Makes War on Rumor. Other articles and stories could
well take up the subject of wartime rumor, the relation of
rumor to propaganda, etc.

(9) Films.

Only one good film on rumor and its effect on morale has
appeared so far to the knowledge of the writer. This film is
Mr. Blabbermouth, produced by M G M, and it an excellent,
although dated, piece of anti-rumor propaganda. Its basic
theme is the caricature and ridicule of the typical rumor
spreader.
