RACE DISCRIMINATION-NEGROES

C. Mrs. Roosevelt is also partly responsible.

11. "Statement was made that white and negro racial trouble is
inevitable; that it is caused by pampering of negroes by 
various Government agencies; and that it is getting to a 
point where it is almost impossible to discuss the negro
question without the name of Mrs. Roosevlet as their champion
being brought into the matter." (Florida)

12. "Washington is fearful of race riots in that city. Feeling
has become especially bitter since Mrs. Roosevelt's luncheon
for a group of negro women at a swank hotel and they're
afraid it's going to get clear out ofhand. Some white war
workers are leaving Washington because negroes are becoming
so offensive." (Nebraska)

13. "The papers say there were race riots last night in Dallas,
New Orleans and Atlanta. Mrs. Roosevelt has sure started 
something." (Washington, D.C.)

14. "Mrs. Roosevelt was thrown out of the Hermitage (Nashville
Hotel) because she wanted negroes to stop in the hotel too."
(Alabama). 

15. "These Negroes are being provoked by enemy aliens who hand
out propaganda. It's terrible to get help nowadays. Out 
at the Beach (Virginia Beach) my friends' maids have all 
joined the Eleanor Club. They say the aim of the club is 
to have all white women doing their own work by October first."
(Virginia)

16. "Negro women in Pensacola have organized a group which they
have named "The Eleanor Society." Their principal objective 
is understood by white people to be aimed at declining
household work in order to force white ladies into their 
kitchens." (West Florida)

17. "I understand the negro women have formed Eleanor Roosevelt
clubs and have chapters all over the country."
(Alabama)

D. The domestic servant situation is terrible.

18. If the government doesn't stop giving relief and old age
pensions, we won't be able to get any help. I've trained
five cooks in 6 weeks--and I don't have one now. There are
plenty of jobs for those able to work without government
spending money feeding them. (Georgia)
