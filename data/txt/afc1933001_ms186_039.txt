Dear Alan:
I thought quite well of your idea, and
still do, to store my records in the Library;
but there are some difficulties at present. In 
the first place it might be best to keep them
out of Washington until the war is over. In the 
second place I have not made my final check of
the first hundred. I transcribed the words last 
winder, and sent the duplicate discs to a specialist
to complete the tune transcriptions so that
I could make my final check, using the original
discs when necessary; but the musician who is doing
the job has not as yet finished. I shall transcribe
the words of the second hundred discs this
winter, and then place the word transcriptions 
and the duplicate discs in the hands of other tune
specialists. But I cannot make my final checks
and prepare the MS for the press until I have the
reports from my tune experts. The work is under
way and will be pushed as fast as possible. I
need also help in typing in preparing my MS from
the discs, and also in preparing my other folklore
materials. As things are now, one might say,
and not go very far wrong, that I am keeping a
bad shop.
I have yet several short trips to make this
fall and winter, finishing up the section I was in
this summer; and shall be in the field again next
year, July 1943-1944. I need $1000.00 for a year's
work of ten weeks in the field and the week-end trips 
I make throughout the year. I expect to make from 300
to 500 recordings during the year, from old people,
not from young people of the new fashion. I need also
$500.00 for help in the office, in getting my papers 
in better shape and in preparing for the press. I 
shall appreciate your best wishes. 
I trust you have a pleasant summer at Indiana
and elsewhere. We were glad to have you in our home,
and hope that you will come to us again.

Sincerely,
L. Chappell
