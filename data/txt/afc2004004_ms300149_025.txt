Dear Friend,
An additional number by the "Mountain
Ramblers" is going to be released 
within the next two months as part
of a new folk music series put out by
Prestige, Inc. I have, therefore,
sent James Lindsay, your manager, a
check in the amount of $26.00, which 
covers the fee for the part of the
"Mountain Ramblers" on this particu-
lar number.
Yours cordially,
Alan Lomax
