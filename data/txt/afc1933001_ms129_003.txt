Well, I never was very
good at letter writing, and
I don't guess this letter is 
any exception.
So I will close inviting
you to visit me again
if you are ever in KY,
and to write when you
feel inclined. I will
always answer some
may time or [?]

Yours truly
Clay Walters
address my mail to: Hendricks, KY.

I hope you enjoyed
a nice Christmas. The
weather here was very
warm. And the ground
was muddy.
I would like for 
you to make another
visit. I suppose you 
will visit other states
and get songs, and sure
wish you lots of success.
