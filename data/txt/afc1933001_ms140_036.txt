Mr. John Hammond
175 Sullivan Street
New York, New York

Dear Mr. Hammond:

The stimulating evening that I spent with you in New
York last summer was really a turning point for me. It
won me over clearly and finally to the camp of the jazz
enthusiasts and I want to thank you for the part you played
in the episode.

When I was in Chicago, I dropped in to see Albert
Ammons, among others, and now that I understand you are
sponsoring a regular jamboree of boogie-woogie-ists in Carnegie
Hall, I am anxious to attend. Is it still possible
to obtain tickets for the evening? And by the way, are recordings
going to be made of the entire session? From what
I have heard, I imagine that this will be the most imporant
of the Carnegie Hall concerts of popular music and as
an historical event, it should be recorded and a permanent
set of these records be deposited in the Archive.

During our pleasant evening together, I recall asking
you whether the Library might not have a set of the swing
records that you had made for your own enjoyment. Your
response was in the affirmative and I should like to hold
you to your promise. Several of these recordings were, as
I remember them, the most exquisite swing music I have so
far heard.

May I expect to hear from you in regard to these several
questions as soon as possible?

Sincerely yours,


Assistant in Charge
