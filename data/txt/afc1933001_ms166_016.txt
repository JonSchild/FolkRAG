Dear Dr. Evans:
John A. Lomax, Honorary Curatoe of Folk Song of the 
Library of Congress is working at the Library at the moment,
writing up his experiences and field notes over his years of 
collecting.  This material will form one of the most valuable
parts of the Archive collection and will be an indespensible
supplement to the records themselves, andnI believe, one of 
the most important human documents in the Library itself. Enclosed,
are two samples of the work now pouring out from his pen.
Mrs. Lomax is devoting her full time to writing up field notes, 
transcribing texts and coordinating the whole with the records. 
The volume of work to be completed is, however, so large
that stenographic help is vitally necessary. Mr. Lomax is, at the
moment, employing two part-time secretarys out of his own pocket
for the job. It seems to me that, in view of the contribution 
which Mr. Lomax has made to the Library of Congress collections
during the past seven years, the Library should provide stenographic 
facilities for him during his stay here. 
Sincerely yours, 
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
Library of Congress
