[*Rumors*]
November 4, 1942

Dear Mrs. Morrison:

I am writing at the request of Mrs. Roosevelt to
thank you for your letter with its inspiriting words of appreciation 
for her and its evidence of patriotism and determination.

We appreciate your calling our attention to the rumor
about "our hospitals bulging with wounded." You are quite right
in feeling that every responsible citizen must do his best to
check such rumors wherever he meets them. The Government, also,
is on the alert and is making every effort not only to prevent
the spread of specific rumors but to create a state of public
opinion so healthy that the rumor-virus does not flourish in it.

It is, of course, impossible to deal with each of
the thousands of rumors abroad in the land. We have found,
moreover, that direct dental is not necessarily the most effective
method of scotching rumors. Their appeal is apt to be to the 
emotions rather than the intellect, and the factual refutation
often falls short of the mark.

In the case of the rumor you mention, we question
whether a letter denying the statement would prove as effective
as might be hoped. If you wish to make the attempt, you might
try approaching the local public relations officer of the Army,
as this sort of information can be given out only by the War
Department.

Be assured that my suggestions do not indicate a
lack of realization of the gravity of the rumor problem and
that your own interest in the matter is much appreciated. Experience 
has convinced us, however, that it is best to concentrate 
our energy, not on fighting rumors that have sprung up
but rather on building a strong body of enlightened public opinion 
which is the best defense against divisionist and defeatist
misstatements.


Sincerely yours,

R. Keith Kane,
Chief, Bureau of Intelligence
