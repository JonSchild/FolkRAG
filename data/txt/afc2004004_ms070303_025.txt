June 21
Thursday night Doctor MacLean's house. The
company very middle class & respectable looking.
The men all in coats - the women all worked
& suited - comfortable. They are
all middle-aged. They've sung
before & are sure of themselves -
Ironically a (balay?) bcast by
Scots BBC came on at 10 and
we listened, they sang all
choruses, completely drowning 
N. Vist out.

McPhee from Benbecula - fat, round
faced, plus fours of terrific checked brown
tweed, directs all the singing 

The acc playing was fine - but 
mostly it was children & rather quavery.
There was a recitation about a dispute
over a tractor & it turned out the plow 
was lost.

These people are great  song
leaders. .they come in
