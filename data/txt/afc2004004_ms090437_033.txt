Fisk, 15.  5. WILL STARK

dent, the boss.  And we was cutting lumber for P.F. Stone of Cincinnati,
I think that was what we was [cutting,] shipping the lumber to.  But
anyhow they'd a lumber inspector there; he was a white man & he would
come around and tell me sometime, he said, "Will, that lumber is just
a little too thin; move your pin back a hole further."  Well, I'd
tell the block setter and he'd move the hole back further.  Mr.
Bob, he's the superintendent, he's say - uh "What the hell, Will, did
you move the pin back further?  That lumber's too thick."  I say, 
"Well, Mr. Lee told me to move that."  He say, "  You put it
back there in that pin."  I say, "Put it back there where he tell you,
Paul."  & say, "Mr. Lee say that's too thin, just little bit too
light."  He say, "Well, its' no such goddam thing.  You tell him. I say- leave it in the hole where I set it.  It ain't too thin....You tell him 
I said so."  "No sir, Mr. Bob, Mr. Lee is a white man.
If you want him told, you tell him."  I sid, " I wasn't taught to 
talk to white folks that-a-way."  And he say --  something he gits to talking
about -- he say, "HE's a goddamn liar, ain't he?"  I say, "Well, I
ain't talk that way, I wasn't raised that way.  My grandmother partly raised me
up and taught me to be always obedient to white folks."

                                     Rowdy Soul [THE YAHOO SONG.]

Last year I plowed a one-horn oxen
This year I plow the muley
If I don't make but fifteen cents,
I'm gonna take it back home to Julie.

[Ref]   I'm a Rowdy soul, rowdy soul,
Make no difference whether I work or no.

My gal went to church last night,
Set [right] behind the steeple.  
She led a [afar and] fart and 
Broke my heart,
Shit all over the people.
         
I'm a rowdy soul, rowdy sol,
Make no difference if I work or no.

Tell my wife when you go to the hills
 I got me a job at the sorghum mills.
