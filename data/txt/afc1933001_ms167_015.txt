Alan Lomax                            Dr. Spivacke - Music


February 6, 1941

Dear Dr. Spivacke:

The re-shelving of original records is becoming a
very serious problem and I wish that you would make some
arrangements about this soon to insure the originals against
injury.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
