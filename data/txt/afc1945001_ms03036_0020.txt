Defense workers are more interested in their jobx than in doing
things to win the war. They are spending their money in beer parlors. [*7a*]

The farm bloc is political. There is no reason why butter should
have gone up 4Â¢ last week. It's politics.
Grocer, St. Paul, 8/10

We feel there is no reason why butter, eggs, cheese and other
things that are on the surplus commodities list should go up so much,
if there is a surplus of these things something is wrong when they go up
so high.
Grocer, St. Paul, 8/10

The Jews control the money, that's why they are hated all over. [*6*]

The Jews are responsible for the war. [*6*]

The Jewish buyers come along and they buy up hogs and the scrap
and they are making money out of the war. [*6*]

Some fathers try to get their sons into defense work so they [*1*]
won't have to be drafted.
Clerk, Minneapolis, 8/11

There is not a fair drawing in the draft. I know three sons in
a family of eight and nobody is taken. I know two families where the sons [*1*]
are not taken and other families where they need the boys on the farm but
they are taken away.
