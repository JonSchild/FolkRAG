Miss Dorothy Gebeaur
University of Texas
Austin, Texas

Dear Miss Gebeaur:

    Alan Lomax is to be on a program of The Texas Folk
Lore Society Meeting the first week in May. He wants to
put on a show at the university with his guitar and his un-
doubted ability to sing American Folk Songs. He would charm
a university audience, in my judgment, and I say this without
any apologies, whatever. If any of the organizations there
could take the matter up directly with Alan,c/o Music Division,
Library of Congress, I believe all parties will be satisfied.
He wants a fee of $100.00 and there should be a considerable
amount left for the organization. Please speak to some of your
people if you can find the time and let me know what you think.
Miss Terrill continues to be the charming and admirable person
that the good Lord made her- only more so,

    Sincerely yours,
    John A. Lomax
    Honorary Curator and Consultant
    Archive of American Folk Song
    Library of Congress
