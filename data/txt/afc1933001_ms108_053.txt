Miss Bess Brown Lomax
Rose Hall
Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania

Dear Bess: 

I broke several hearts with your letter from
Czechoslovakia but assure you that this has not proven
very successful. One positive suggestion that has been 
made is that you advertise for the lady in the various
foreign newspapers (Czechoslovak and liberal German-
American) that are printed in the United States. Some 
Czech paper might even be willing to run the letter entire
and some honest widower's heart might be broken 
with practical results for Miss LÃ¶winger. 

Nick and I are going out into Maryland for a week 
of work on the play I told you about beginning this
afternoon and you can expect to hear from me only after
we come up for air next Monday. Have you forgotten that
Jean ought to be writing a story about your Austrian
boy in McGee, Arkansas?

When you have read this paragraph, seal you lips
forever and burn the letter. In other words, this is
confidential. Spivacke and I this week have spent in
imagination $38,000 on a new Archive. (P.S. I don't
think se'll get it!). That is all the news I can think
of now except that you're generally regarded here as thr
white hope of the generation and everyone, including myself,
is very fond of you. Please convey my greetings 
to Eddy and if you have anything to be looked up in the
catalogue, write the Librarian.

Love,
