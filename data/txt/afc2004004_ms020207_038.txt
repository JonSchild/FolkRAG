Reverend Roe.  Reel 10.  P. 1
A: You say you can't use a wh at?
R: [A unkyer-see] An anxious seat, a mourner's bench like you used to . If ypu call a sinner,
if he come to your service, and you call him up there tonight why he won't be back; he say you bothering
him. You've just got to preach to him on that bench, and if you can't
win him that way, why, you just lost him. And if you try to bring
[*Don't use mourner's bench*]
him up there, why, he just goes off and don't come back. So we decided
 it would be best for us to let him kinda 'tend the church, and we preach
to him [when] let him he sit back there in the back, just so's we can get the

Reverend?
[*Diffs. between denominations are foolish.*]
R: I'm sure it would. Yessir.
A: Do you think that the points that they difference on are not very important? 
R: Not very imporant for the most of them. They's some of them is just out-
right ridiculous but some of them, they're so near together till there
ain't anything that would make them differ[ent] but prejdice . One
wants the crowd and [is] he's afraid the other [will] 'll get it.
A: Do you believe in preaching Hell-fire these days as much as you used
to?
R: I do. I believe the Gospel is the same and 'll always be. As long as we
find in the Bible a Hell and a Heaven, it ought to be preached [according] because
