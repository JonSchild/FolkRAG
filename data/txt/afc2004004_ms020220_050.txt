[*(ATTITUDES RE GETTING ALOnG WITH PEOPLE)*]

'Cause that's the reason I often tell[s] people, I never 
had no trouble in Georgia.  We jus' run some kinda way, in the,
in the, in the deep stream.  Ya know,  tha's all, I say.  An' ah,
an' I was livin' with people.  An' Papa an' them was the same 
way.  They didn't never [deal] live with nobody that, that they couldn't
git along with. 'Cause, 'cause he'll move any time. Move right
the. He'll leave the field. That -- To go. Tha's all. An'
somebody else'll hire 'im 'cause he's a great worker. Ya see?
Great farmer. They be glad to know that, you know, as some
have. They's come an' get 'im. Yeah.

by myself, me an' my cousin. Yeah, I was done grown then. My
land, way up grown! I had a big, grown daughter. I lived with
Mama an' them all the time, until '24. You know, what you might
say all the time, [meanin'] in an' out. I was, I was ah, in
Fitzgerald a while, but that wasn't so long. Ya know? But I
don't kinda (count that?) be long, 'cause I go back an' fo'th
