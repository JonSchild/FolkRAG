2. One afternoon Hitler and his companions were
     riding down a street in Berlin. Theyer (sic) car
     hit and killed a dog. Hitler told his compion (sic)
     to go to the woman who owned the dog
     and tell her he was [dog] dead. When he
     came back he told Hitler that the woman
     jumped with joy. Hitler asked him what
     he had said. He told him he had said: - 
     "Heil Hitler, the dog is dead."
3.  Hitler saw a skunk go in a hole one day
     and he told his companion to go in & see
     what it was. The companion came out
     and said "But it stinks in there." So Hitler
     went in and the skunk came out and
     said "Pu! It stinks in there."
