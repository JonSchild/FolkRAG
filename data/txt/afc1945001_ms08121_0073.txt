Anecdotes

Here is an outline of how our
war started with Japan. It all
happened when Japan sent two of
her men over to talk peace with
us. While the Ambassador Nomura
and Envoy Kurusu were keeping
us busy with their talk
of peace, little did we know of what
Safo[?] was preparing for us. Until
finally we realized what she
was up to on December 7, 1941,
when she stroke us from behind.
