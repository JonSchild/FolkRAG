Tape:  #893  cont.  Nimrod Workman   7
(Everything Republican)
Nimrod:  No, it was Republicans and they sold it, everything
was Republican, the coal company backed the Republicans, and 
you had to vote for the Rep. or you didn't have a job.  He'd
tell you who to vote for.  No such thing, not even a constable,
was a democrat, it was republicans.  You had to do that.  And
if you quit, or they fire you, you go up to this man, and they'd
say, yes, we need a man. . .Like he'd say to me, Mr. Workman,
you move into house # so and so, we need a man.  All right
then.  Then when he got ready to book you, he'd say, I'll call
the big boss and tell him you'll be out in the morning.  He'd
go and call the big boss, and if you wrote down like I did
Hard Collar(?) Coal Co.,
(Workman Troublemaker)
they'd ring down there, hello there
Hard Collar coal co., did Nimrod Workman work down there for
you.  Yeah.  Did you have trouble with him?  Yeah, he
wouldn't do what we told him and we fired him.  And he'd say
By the way, Mr. Workman, I just called them mines up at the
top of the hill, and the boss said that right now he's full,
but he'd keep you in mind.  And by the way, I called down to
where you come from at that mine and they said that if you come
back down there and apologize to him, you still have your house
and your job back.  You was burnt from one to another.  You
had to do what he said, brother. . . . . .Lord, after reading (?)
that I said Jesus Christ almighty. . . .Before Lewis(?) come
out, I had two fellas and they were scared to death. . . . . . .
