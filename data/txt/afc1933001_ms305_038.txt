NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER'S
autobiography, Across the Busy
Years, is the product of eager adherence
to the formula for autobiography 
designed by the topmost circle 
of the owning class which defines
what can and what cannot be told,
what conduces to the security of the
owning class and what, even remotely,
threatens it. The formula has
been so revised and improved that
it is now possible to appear to go
off the reservation without doing so.
As everyone might have known,
Nicholas Miraculous lacks the courage
and ability to do even that.

His role in the Republican Party
has been so intimate that it is impossible
for his apologists-if such there
be-to allege that he was kept in
ignorance of the pillage and hypocrisy
by which American democracy
has been traduced. The impudence
with which he deploys polite anecdotes
to distract public attention
from the heart of a matter is the arrogance
of a lackey who knows what
and when the master approves. He
hopes to attain some small place in
history by leaving his private correspondence
to the library of Columbia 
University. I venture the opinion
that he has destroyed or deleted
everything that would convict him
and his betters of their crimes. How,
otherwise, could he now condone,
evade and dismiss such egregious
scandals, for example, as those of
the Harding administration?

Butler says Harding told him that
he, Harding, was not fit for the Presidency
and should never have had it.
This is part and parcel of the "official"
explanation of capitalist murder
and theft under the White House
poker player. Genial, kindly Harding
was deceived by his friends.
Phooey! He was nominated because
he had proven for twenty years that
he could take orders-any orders. It
is regrettable that Samuel Hopkins
Adams promotes this "official" obfuscation
in his The Incredible Era: The
Life and Times of Warren Gamaliel
Harding. For Mr. Adams has collected
a lot of solid information about
the brazen riot of plunder perpetuated
by the highest government officials
and the most respectable American
capitalists. Mr. Adams is ignorant
of the causes of such social degeneracy,
but his book is a fairly 
complete record of the
kind of events which the
owning class seeks to
erase from the memory of
the living and from the 
eyes of the future. Read
it. And in order to refute
the capitalist assertion
that the Federal government
is corrupt only once
in a while, read Kenneth
G. Crawford's The Plunder
Boys, a superficial but 
honest account of the control
of democratic processes
via lobbies.

While this corruption
goes on at the top of life,
honest thinkers down below
steadfastly labor to
improve the lot of human
beings, to solve the problems
which nature presents,
and to make life
in the future more secure,
rational, interesting.
Three new books reflect
some of this labor and

striving. Each of them has deficiencies,
but from each I have obtained
much information about life
today. Henry Pratt Fairchild's
People: The Quality and Quantity
of Population is a model of how complex
material can be simplified and
lucidly arranged. His views on
eugenics and genetics are not as non-
speculative as they should be, but he
doesn't use the for reactionary purposes.
And he does explain the sociology
of populations and their rates
of change. Corrington Gill's Wasted
Manpower: The Challenge of Unemployment
describes the surface facts
of a social situation which has resulted
in the loss of 130 billion dollars'
worth of national income in the
last ten years. His suggestion for the
cure of unemployment is absurd and
his comments on unemployment in the
USSR are almost intentionally casual.
But he makes accessible significant
factual material and proves that
under capitalism unemployment is
permanent. And Christy Borth's
Pioneers of Plenty: The Story of
Chemurgy, though unfortunately
tainted by technocratic and Henry
Fordian ignorances, popularized little
known information about plastics and
other products ensuing from the 
union of farm and industry in the
presence of the great catalyst, chemical
engineering.

There are two new books in the
field of literature which reflect this
same industrious and talented pur-
