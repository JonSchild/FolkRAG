job; I've a lib. of 2600 spirituals, in consequence
If you have any special interest in my
records (no profit to me, but no further
cost), drop me a line here about it--may
be I'll come down if there seems a chance
of getting them decently preserved.
Just listened to your "American Shantey
song" over W.A.B.C, Tues, 9:15 a.m.
Pretty good job. I enjoyed it tremendously
anyhow, till after the first part of Converse's
piece. I'm looking forward to
more work of yours on kindred subjects.
Good luck!
