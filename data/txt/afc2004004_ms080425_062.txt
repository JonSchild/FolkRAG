#223 cont    Tape:  Sacred Harp Interviews    14

AL:     You sang for the pope too, didn't you?

Hugh:    We had a group coming back from New England, and
flew 10 more up and sang just before the Pope come on before
1/2 million people on the mall.  We had 28 microphones-- you
talk about a sound, we really had a sound.

AL:    And tell us, what's this singing going to be like over
at Holly Springs?

Hugh:    Well, Holly Springs is one of the best. . .  you never
heard Sacred Harp singing until you go to Holly Springs.
And when you go there and witness the singing this weekend,
you can go back and saythat you truly been in a Sacred Harp
singing.   It'll be the biggest one that's ever been held.

AL:    I wonder how many people know that?

Hugh:    I wish more did.  You know, Alan, the Sacred Harp
is kind of diminishing some since the late 20's and 30's.
Seems like people have lots more things to keep them busy,
young people don't attend singing schools like they did when
there wasn't anything else to do.  But ther's more people
singing Sacred Harp now than ever before, but there scattered
all over the United States.  They're not the rural originals
. . . . . . .  I keep a record of everyting I ship, North Carolina,
New York, Minn, San Diego, Tennessee, California, Canada,
vermont, Philadelphia, Boston,  . . . . . .I ship numbers of books
to Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and these people
