It is a marvellous tribute to the patience, tolerance,
patriotism, and good sense of colored people, on the whole
that they have been restrained, civil, long-suffering, and
non-resistent to the pressures exerted in the past few months
to exclude them from gainful employment or decent participation
in the war effort.  This has been in a large measure overcome
by the sensible action of local government, state government,
white employers and private citizens, who recognize that we

struggle for every American.

It is to their everlasting credit, that at a time when all
transportation facilities are as crowded as the New York subways,
and under these conditions they have to go to and from their work,

and the spirit of the Jim-Crow laws, while causing such a few

for whom they are now fighting, suffering, and dying upon the
battlefields of the world."

I have talked with a news reporter who has tried to investigate
this rumor around Richmond and he was of the opinion that these
rumors against the Negroes are started by the white people.  He said
there definitely was resentment because domestic workers were asking
for more money at this time and also there was resentment that
