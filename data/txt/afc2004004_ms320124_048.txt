you have the same thing.  Imagine like Dennis McGee's
[UNCLEAR], the Cowboy Waltz.
:  Yeah.
ANCELET  You have a decendant of Irish, 
Scotch-Irish immigrants who intermarried with the Arcadians
singing about a cowboy in French to an old world mazurka
tune.  This is the most amazing cultural gumbo you ever
heard of in your life.
:  And with all that mixture it turned out
all right.
ANCELET  [LAUGHS]  And that's why Cajun
music doesn't sound like Quebec music from Quebec or New
Brunswick or, or France or any other place where they speak
French.  It's, that's what, that's one of the essential
ingredients.  One of the, one of the strongest differences
is the blues.  The, the kind of music that we learned from
our black neighbors.
LOMAX  Do you like the blues yourself?
:  I do.
LOMAX  Do you, do you feel the strength
of the black tradition?
:  No.  I love it.  I love it.  It's a 
slow going thing but it's, it's well put [up].  You got that
[mar, mechanic] in his way of doing things, you know, when
he do it right, you know.  I love it.
