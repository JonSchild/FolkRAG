THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A WORKER   (?)
(To the tun of "There's Something
About a Solider.")

There's something about a worker
There's something about a worker
There's something about a worker
That is fine, fine, fine.
There's something in his bearing
Something in what he's wearing
Something about his features all a
shine, shine, shine.
He may be a little inspector
He may be a big die-maker
He may be a common worker on the line,
line, line.
But the worker's healthy chest
Seems to suit the ladies best
There's something about a worker that 
is fine, fine, fine!

THE FISHER STRIKE  [checkmark]
(Tune: The Martins and the Coys)

Gather round me and I'll tell you all 
a story,
Of the Fisher Body Factory Number One,
When the dies they started moving.
The Union Men they had a meeting, 
To decide right then and there what
must be done.

Chorus:
These 4000 Union Boys,
Oh, they sure made lots of noise,
They decided then and there to shut down
tight.
In the office they got snooty,
So we started picket duty
Now the Fisher Body Shop is on a strike.

Now this strike it started one bright 
Wednesday evening,
When they loaded up a box car full of dies.
When the union boys they stopped them,
And the Railroad Workers backed them, 
The officials in the office were surprised.

Repeat Chorus...

Now the   really started out to
strike in earnest.
They took possession of the gates
and buildings too.
They placed a guard in either 
clockhouse,
Just to keep the non-union men out, 
And they took the keys and locked the gates up too.

Repeat Chorus...

CHEVY BATTLE SONG
(Tune: "Trail of the Lonesome Pine")

There was a great big fight on Monday
in front of Chevy nine.
Where the gas shells were exploding
in the good old picket line.

Where the policemen's clubs were
swinging, but we paid them no 
mind.

And we'll give the women credit for 
holding that picket line.

After long, long years of slaving
We'll all have  dough in our jeans

When the wages are sufficient to buy
more than pork and beans!

There'll be lots of flight and picketing
until our dreams all come true.

For we've shown the General Motors
what the Union Boys can do!
