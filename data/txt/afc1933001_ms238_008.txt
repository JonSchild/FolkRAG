the past two months she has sent
us jointly one postal card. No
more. I had very much
hoped that she could be here
for Johnny's wedding, though
that can't be if her degree is
imperilled by further interruptions
of her studies. I have
no information at present,
only a general notion that when
we saw her she was behind
with some of her themes. I am
making no complaint through
you.
I asked Jerry to send me a
list of the songs on all the cylinder
records and copies of any appended notes,
for possible use in my Adventures.
You might speed him along with
a judicious inquiry.
