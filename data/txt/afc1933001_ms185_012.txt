Burlington, N.C.

Dear Mr. Collins:

Dr. H.C. Archibald of Brown University
has requested that we copy for him Archive
record number 3786* a version of "Lady Isabel
and the Elf Knight" recorded by you in 
1939. Upon my informing him that it could
not be duplicated without your express permission,
he requested that we obtain this
permission if possible. He is anxious to
purchase copies of all our versions of this
ballad "to exemplify the store of material
which may be procured from your Library."
He intends them for the Mary Mellish Archibald
Memorial Library, Mount Allison University,
Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada, which he
describes as "the best place in Canada for
study of songs and Ballads in the English
Language. All records are for the purposes
of study and research. . . . I assure you
that there will never be any other use of
records than what I have indicated above."

If you wish to correspond with Dr.
Archibald, his address is Brown University,
Providence, Rhode Island. If, however, you
decide to permit duplication of this song,
please notify us directly to that effect.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant
Archive of American Folk Song
