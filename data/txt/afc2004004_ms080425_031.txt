AL giving instructions to camera men for Raymond Hambrick 
interview.
AL:   this is Raymond Hambrick, who is probably the most 
active composer in the Sacred Harp tradition.  Up until. . .
oh, all through the nineteenth century, the talented 
people of the southern back woods were writing "fuguing" 
tunes in four parts to be published in the Sacred Harp and 
other parts of the shape note literature.   And Mr. Hambrick, 
here, is one of the people I understand, still actively 
practicing composition in that field.  I heard about you 
from Hugh McGraw.
