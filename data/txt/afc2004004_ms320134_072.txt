LOMAX-SCRATCH 3   -14

LOMAX  This continued, and of course in
Canada where hundreds of ancient French ballads have been
recovered and in Louisiana where I found, my father, my
father and I found ancient ballads still surviving in songs
of girls who were raped by mounted knights and songs of
shepherdesses and meeting. . .[TELEPHONE]. . .in the lonely
mountain, meeting their lover in the lonely mountain glade.
At least half the funny songs in west European and southern
American tradition are satires on male ineptitude of one
sort or another.  Women taking out their, taking out the,
their feelings of annoyance on the men.  And but the peak of
all these is the, in the songs the tiny husband, that's the
most popular ballad of, that used to be the most popular
ballad in old time Cajun country.  [Le petit marie], man so
small that when the girl married him she lost him in the
straw mattress and went looking for him with a candle.  The
mattress caught fire and he was burnt to a crisp.  She took
him to his funeral in a little white saucer.
     :  All right, I think the thing, you don't
want to really tell a story, do you?
LOMAX  Well. . .these mic mac trained
hunters of Nova Scotia, these experienced marsh dwellers of
[Watou] loved the, the Louisiana low lands country where
they landed.  Here was, were swamps 10,000 times greater
than anything they've seen in, in France or, or Nova Scotia.
