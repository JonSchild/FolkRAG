Am I asking too much? In any case let me know what you think, and
particularly whether you are likely to be up this way soon.
     I have been trying to check up about the complimentary copies
of OUR SINGING COUNTRY, and, unfortunately, our records are not very
clear. It seems that we did agree after the contract was signed to
supply ten copies of the book instead of the original six, but since 
the contract was signed by your father alone these were all sent on
to him. In any case, I am having a copy sent to Mr. Robbins of New
York University, as you request, and one copy t you.

Cordially yours,


Mr. Alan Lomax
Division of Music
The Library of Congress
