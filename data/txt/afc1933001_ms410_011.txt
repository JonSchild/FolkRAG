My dear Mr. Lomax:

I am delighted to know that you will
issue a revised edition of your Cowboy
Songs.  I shall be very glad to have
you include the three songs you wish to
use from Singing Cowboy.

I have been in New Mexico because of
my father's death, and so did not receive
your letter at once.   Consequently I
have been a long time answering you.

Cordially,
Margaret Larkin
