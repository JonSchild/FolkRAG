Lindos, Rhodes
Sept. 11--

Dear Hamish --

There will be three or four programs in
which Scots material will figure.  Aside
from the introductory program, in which
I would like the most appealing Lowlands
song you have.  There is a program
which runs from Cornwall -- North to
the borders.  I'd like to end this
with a bit of good ballad singing,
with chorus singing of the refrain
from S.W. Scotland.  Another program
runs from Norfolk to Newcastle -
maybe ending in a bit of Scots song.
The next program in which you will
principally figure is Borders to Shetland
& Orkney -- should be largely English
language with maybe one bit of Gaelic
from Glenshee or Easter Ross to show
it's there.  Next program will be done
