such types of songs, songs of the lumberjacks,
miners' songs,  railroad songs, songs of the Forty-Niners, songs
of the Great Lake[s], song of the Erie Canal, [and] Negro [?] Songs.
      
Some of these songs have been of such merit as to live, 
and it is these that we are now able to preserve. The ballad making
of the Negro goes on today and his beautiful spirituals are unique
in the literature of the world. His secular songs when better known
will doubtless win an equal place in the esteem of mankind. Not
all by an means are case in a heroic or sad mood. There are love
songs, even play songs for children, and many tender and beautiful
lullabies, besides the cheerful and singing songs of labor.
  
Before separating for the night a thousand miners in Utah
stand about the mine pit and sing "Joe Bowers"; in hundred of lumber
camps voices chant the redoubtable exploits of Silver Jake; at
cowboy reunions you can still hear the real cowboys, in cowboy
manner and phrasing, tell the stories of "The Dying Cowboy," "The
Old Chisholm Trial" and of the "Little Doggies"; in remote districts
of the South black labor in gangs yet picture the surge and heave
of labor~~the clang of hammers on steel bolts, the ring of the cane
knife, the swish of the hoes cutting grass roots, the slow movement of
lazy mules up and down the banks of a levee~~through the medium of
song with graphic words fitted into unique and [little known] unusual musical
[forms] combinations.
