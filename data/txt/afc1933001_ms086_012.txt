Dear John

It is good to have your letter come to hand just as I
was getting ready to write you. I am writing Alan that
I shall leave open the first two weeks of March for him
to do with as best he can. I enjoy your comments and
enclosures about the lad, He is intensely American and
flagrantly and vagrantly modern, somewhat of my own trend
except that I could never being to catch him in certain
areas of sheer metal efficiency. Whatever jails he may
land in I am still for him as a character witness. And
if he should also perform so that remote generations
would remember him as having the brightness of a traffic
light I would say okay by me and it is no surprise.
I like the tone of yourletter, its report of the human
drifts you are working in, and the progress of your soul.
One certainty is that neither of us will ever become
wholly sanctified so long as we have this yen for
pursuing the elusive folk song in a way that sometimes
puts us right inside the skin and frame of the sinner.
Hoping to hear you talk about new finds, and to exchange
annual reports, I shall see you when crossing Texas next
winter -

Faithfully yours,
