One day we held our mike up to the barred door of
the Florida State Penitentiary and recorded one of the lements
of a poor tubercular prisoner who knew he was going to die.

Mamma, Mamma, make me a garment,
And make it long, white, and narrow.

Mamma, Mamma, look on my pillow
And you will find some money.

Get along, boys, and gather 'round me,
Come pay my fine, come and get me.

My true love died the other day
I believe I'll die tomorrow.
