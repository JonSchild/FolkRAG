About bothies.
But in the evenings, all they had to do was to sit and look
in the fire. Sometimes, later on, of course, a melodeon
came in, and they used that for amusement. And there's no
doubt about it that your bothy ballads originated in the 
older days when their only entertainment was what they
could make themselves.
