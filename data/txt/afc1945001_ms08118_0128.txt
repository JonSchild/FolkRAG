               You have taken the sugar from
              my tea and coffee
               The coffee out of the cup
               The meat out of my pot
               You left my care bare foot
               The shoes have been taken
               What in the world do you 
               want next.
                Although I am not mad
               I will give up every thing to
               slap [thoes] those dirt in gap.
                        [By]  Buy War bonds and
                                         Stamps
