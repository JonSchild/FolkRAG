Old Rafe would poke me with his thumb and
wink and we all laugh and carry on......
Sunday morning folks would pass him on the
way to church, says, Rafe, come on go to church with us....
He’d say: “No, I won’t go. You all just give God my love..”
And he'd sing.....
Railtoad Bill, railroad Bill
He never work and he never will
Ride on, railroad Bill
Railroad Bill, comin down the hill
Lightin his seegars with a five dollar bill
Ride on Railroad Bill....
Of course the strongest influence on Nora’s life came
from the church.....
She told me about the preacher who brought her into the church.
He was a sho-nuff good pastor..... He would preach so till you
could take his coat off and wring water out of it. They say
they keep the windows and doors close near the pulpit otherwise
he just jump out. They say he busted somethin preachin too hard
and doctors say he couldn’t preach no more. But he'd be plowin 
and a preachin spell would hit him, he’d throw his hat down
throw up his hands, tear across the field with his wife swinging
onto trying to stop him but he say I’m gonna preach till I die
And that’s just what he did. He preached till he died and he died
smilin.... I remember how he used to tell us to comfort us...

‘When I look out on his Creation, I see white deers, black
deers and all different colors. I see the same in cows. I see
the same in hogs. Then I look out on the earth and I see the
earth that He made and I see flowers comin—some red, some blue,
some white—-all comin up on the same ground. It’s a mystery to
me but it’s God. . And [?] He must mean for us to live together
He must have meant so........
There’s a white flower and a blue flower and they keeps
their seed apart and every one produce their own kind and
that could be the same with us. But if you want a beautiful 
bouquet you must get flowers of all colors and bring them
together and that makes a bouquet beautiful. ‘.......
That’s a short version, Dave
of the preacher in my book who was called to preach
and did.   LOMAX TO DAVE
fortunately for me, long enough to be recorded.....
