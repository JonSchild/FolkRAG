Didi Chandler--best drummer.  Player with Robichaux a while.
Could play any kind of drums.

Robichaux did high class work.  All the millionaires took him 
and he played in the theaters.

Lorenzo Tio--good clarinet player.  His father taught all the best
clarinet players to come out of New Orleans.  Lorenzo now dead.
Was running on a river boat from New York to Albany.  Drank a lot
of whiskey, caught cold and died in New York.  Lorenzo was a swell
guy, was a Creole, easy going.  He wore his high-top shoes until
he died.  Lorenzo taught the guys in New York all they knew.  He
would use a reed sometimes two or three years.  Could fix up any
old clarinet.  Simian and Nicholas taught by old man Tio.

A blues is a slow, lazy tune.

Vibrato promotes nothing but discord. [*Nothing but an imitation of a jack hollering*]
All right for one instrument.
I claim it is the worse thing that ever happened.  What most of 
them use is a flutter tone.

Lot of imitations of animal sounds.  Used a lot of two bar breaks;
sometimes used an eight bar break.  A break is a surprise.  They
didn't come in until I created the idea of jazz.  Never heard of 
Dixieland Band in New Orleans.  They can't play jazz--don't know 
anything about breaks.

Fay Streckf[*us*] came to New Orleans playing a calliope on a boat.

Big Eye Louie Nelson and Pop Gunfrey also good clarinet players

Bud Scott--guitarist.  Later went all over the country.  Now in
California playing. 

Musicians stayed in New Orleans because they felt that it was the
town.  Rain didn't stop nobody.  It never got cold enough to stop
them.  In their dances, everything was so crowded they didn't
use any steps--just a hug.  They used to mosey a lot.  Used to 
say:  "Boy, that's sassy."  Said: "Ay-nah" when things got hot.
Americans and French went to different places, but the bands went
everywhere.
