I'll soon be freed from every trial,
My body sleep in the old church yard,
I'll drop the cross of self-denial,
And enter on my great reward.
I'm going there to see my classmates,
Who have gone before me, one by one,
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going over home.

I want to wear a crown of glory,
When I get home to that good land;
I want to shout Salvation's story,
In concert with the blood-washed band.
I'm going there to see my Savior,
To sing His praise for evermore;
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going over home.

Farewell, Vain World

Farewell, vain world, I'm going home;
My Savior smiles and bids me come,
Sweet angels beckon me away,
To sing God's praise in endless day.

I'm glad that I was born to die;
From grief and woe my soul shall fly,
Bright angels shall convey me home, 
Away to new Jerusalem.

I'll praise my Master while I've breath,
I hope to praise Him after death,
I hope to praise Him when I die,
And shout Salvation as I fly.

I soon shall pass the vale of death,
And in His arms I'll lose my breath,
And then my happy soul shall tell,
My Jesus hath done all things well.
