SKYE (contd.)

CALUM MACLEAN: 

You wanted me to tell you this little tale about 
Prince Charlie.  It is one of the 480 stories that
I have recorded from John MacDonald but it was about 
a young man in Glen Moriston who particularly like
the Prince in appearance and when one Prince was being 
pursued by the Hanovarian troops in the North of 
Scotland, if the Prince was in the North this young man 
was in the south so he took the Prince's pursuers off
the Prince's track, so while the Prince was in the Skye
this young man was in Glen Moriston.  When the Prince
was elsewhere in Lochaber, this young man was up in
Sutherlandshire.  Finally they cornered this young man 
one day and he was shot and as he fell and lying dying
the Hanovarian troops came up and he said to them:
"Yes, you have got the Prince at last" and in their
joy and excitement at having at last got the Prince
with this reward glittering before them they cut off 
the young man's head.  It was sent to London but when
it had [large space] to London, they discovered it was not
the Prince's head.  So that was the young man who died
for Prince Charlie.  He is unknown.  No one remembers 
him.
