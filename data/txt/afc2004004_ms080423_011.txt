until pretty recently, wasn't it?

Kyle::  It was really remote until 1945 and then we got some
paved roads and now it's a nice tourist area.
 
AL:  It's been develped here, but mostly by local people,
that right?
 
Kyle:  Yes, most of it's by local people.
 
AL:  You're all for the tourist business, then?

Kyle:  Yeah, that's one of our major industries, the tourist
business.

AL:  What about the dancing in your family-- it goes way
back, doesn't it?

Kyle:  Yeah, we can document it back to 1910.   Soco Gap and
the square dance team, and Sam Queen, Sam Queen was the
father of square dance, our style, mountain style.  I
carried it on for years, and then my son Burton is the
current world champion, and my daughter is the United States
champion overall.  We dreamed about it and finally built the
Stomping Ground, which is now the clogging capital of the
world and we hope to promote our sport through the stomping
ground.

AL:  What do you think it is that square dancing does for
people?  How does it make you feel?  Does it make people
better or more together?
