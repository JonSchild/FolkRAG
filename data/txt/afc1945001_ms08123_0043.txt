I read an article in the paper that said
that women are taking a great part
in the war program of today. They are
taking the places of drafted men in 
factories and joining the W.AAC. Every 
woman that joins The Army of workers
releases a man from his ground duties
so he can fly or fight on ground The 
more men that can fight the sooner
the war will be over. The women during
the past couple of years are more important
to the war program than ever before.
