All you people have been so kind
to us up in London, that we
would like to show our,
appreciation, and we don't want 
to feel that we are in anyone's
debpt.  after everyone being so
kind to us. you see we did not 
receive the correct single fare,
And I understood we were to
receive our fare up and down.
it certainly puts us in a spot.
as regards the money we borrowed
there seems to be a mix up some
place; please do your best to have
this explained and let us know
how we stand, I am closing now
wishing you a prosperous
New Year, and I hope you had a
smashing XMas.  I know you would.
Thanking you I am Yours
Mrs. Cosgrove
