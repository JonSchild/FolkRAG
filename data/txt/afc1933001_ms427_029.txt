ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
(Old Welsh)

(Page 277 - Laurel Song Book)

Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee
All through the night;
Guardian angels God will send thee,
All through the night.
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping,
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping;
I my loving vigil keeping
All through the night.

While the moon her watch is keeping
All through the night;
While the weary world is sleeping;
All through the night.
O'er they spirit gently stealing,
Visions of delight revealing,
Breathes a pure and holy feeling,
All through the night.


AULD LANG SYNE
(Scotland)

(Page 42 - Old Favorite Songs)

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And the days of auld lang syne?

Refrain: For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne,
We'll tak' a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne.


WERMELAND
(Sweden)

(Page 116 - One Hundred Folk Songs of All Nations)

O Wermeland, thou dearest, thou fairest domain,
Bright gem within the shining crown of Sweden,
The tranquil joy that fills me, that here I regain
I would not change for all the bliss of Eden.
Here rocked once my cradle and here shall bloom my grave,
And here the sweetest maiden her love to me once gave.
What higher heaven could I on earth attain?
