PLANTATION (11) (NEAR FITZGERALD)*]

TL: Oh, really!
BJ: Um-hum. When I Was in Fitzgerald! An' so -- I mean, I ever lived
at. I'd seen 'em in, in Cuspeth. When we'd go on trains, you
know, like that. But I had never lived in a house with one like
that 'till I was in Fitzgerald. I'd go in there an' flush the
water jus' for fun. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha,
ha! That was in Fitzgerald.
          I used to went over to Abbottville an' stay two, three
weeks with the same lady. She had a big farm, a big place. An'
her husban' was a lawyer. An' so We had a nice time, won'erful time,
too. 
TL: What did you do when you were at Fitzgerald?
BJ: I didn't do anything. Maw was workin' for peoples. Oh...
TL: Oh, I see.
BJ: At that time, ya know. Until we left her, then I begin to--
like we lef', [like] after we lef' Fitzgerald -- didn't leave Fitzgerald
but we went out in the country. You know, Mama decided
we would. The fact about it, we was...jus' been on,  jus' been
on with her right on, but you see, her an' her husband [was] fell
out. An' [they] after they fell out [out] Mama jus' [along there] left. An' we, we
all lef' at least. An' went on, went on out in the country from
Fitzgerald. That was where we fell back back into farmin' again,
ya know? With the Langfords. An' so I's jus' finished up -- I
say finished up raisin'                     . You know, with
the Langfords, was white people. Wasn' nobody on this plantation
but I an' Mama an' ah, you know, our family. Jes' us.
One house of colored peoples. Between three houses a white, ya
know? An' so they jus' liked us an' we stayed there an' stayed
there.
