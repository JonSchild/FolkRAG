You should also realize that I have openly told you
at what points I have disagreed with you in theory
or practice. If you feel that I have said things
about you carelessly or slightingly -  that I go around
leaving an impression of lack of confidence or any 
shade of doubt about you, you are completely wrong.
Practically my only comment has been that next to
Gordon you know more about American folk-song
than anyone in the country, and that in Negro folk-song
no one knows as much as you.
I want you to have not only officially 
friendly relations with me - but personally as well
Sincerely
Herbert
P.S. Please give Ms. Flanders my regards.
