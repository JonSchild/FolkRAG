leave off the important and lengthy
job of transcribing the woods off our latest
recordings and checking the transcriptions
of the old We will attend to this as soon
as possible and send you the seventy-
five (approximate) records catalogued and
explained so that you will have at least
the beginning of your folk-song archive
I might add that it will be possible
with a device we have had built for
us in Austin to use the ordinary
wall source of electricity to power
the recording machine This - will
make the work of transcription much
less tedious
