6.

Sinner-man settin' on the gates of hell,
Sinner-man settin' on the gates of hell,
Sinner-man settin' on the gates of hell,
The gates flew open and in he fell,
No hidin' place down there.

O hell is deep an' hell is wide,
O hell is deep and hell is wide,
O hell is deep and hell is wide,
O hell ain't got no bottom or side.

I'd rather pray myself away,
Than live in hell and burn one day.

Oh when I go to hebben, I'll be able to tell
How I shunned that dismal hell.

Ev'y since my Lord done set me fires,
Dis ole worl' bin a hell to me.

Ole Satan he's a-setting' on a red hot seat,
Glory hallelujia!
A coolin' of his head an' a warmin' of his feet,
Glory hallelujia!

Ole Satan wears a mighty big shoe
An' if you don't watch out He's gwine to slip it on you.

He also speaks in the most familiar terms of Heaven:

When I go to heaven I want to go right
I want to go to heaven all dressed in white.

Oh, when I get to heaven,
Gw ine to sit right down,
Ask my Lord for a starry crown,
Sittin' down side o' de Holy Lamb.

Refrain:

Father Abraham
Sittin' down side o' de Holy Lamb,
Help me to sing de song,
Settin' down aside o' de Holy Lamb.
Help me t' move along
Settin' down side o' de Holy Lamb.

I chattered with the Father and I argued with the Son
Told 'em about the old world I done come from,
Settin' down side o' de Holy Lamb.
