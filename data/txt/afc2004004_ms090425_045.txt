Rock Me, Shake Me.
(Manuel Casey)
You better mind, oh, sister,
How you walk on the cross.
Put in your slipper, Your foot might slip - oh
And Or your soul be lost.
I'm [?] Rock me, Lawdy,
Shake, me, Lawdy.
Don't let me sleep - a
Until too late.
Gabriel gonna sound his silver trumpet
In the morn
Gonna swing on the Golden Gate.
Well, Sampson burnt/down the fields of corn.
Well, they looked for Sampson,
And But he was gone.
Well, found old Sampson dead in three or four days,
They took and bound his hadns, his feet with rope.
While walking along, he seen an old jaw bone
An ojo born,
Just moved his hands,
The rope popped like thread,
You got the hand 'fore thousands were dead, through staying a four
Crying,
Cryin' Rockme, Lawdy,
Shake me, Lawdy.
Don't let me sleep - a
Until too late.
Gabriel gonna sound his silver trumpet
In the mornin.
Gonna swing on the Golden Gate.
