Dear Mr. Spivocke: Primarily I 
have you to thank for the 25
records just received by me from
the Library, being copies of of what
seems to be a cross section of
the Folk Song Archive. The shipment,
unanswered, comes express prepaid. The
selections seem to me excellent and
the accompanying notes adequate -
perhaps a mite over-enthusiastic.
but can you [expect that] judge a person 
who dragged this material from
oblivion by the ordinary standards?
Maybe you can, but it
wouldn't be fair.

I think my work is done for
the Folk Song Archive. My pleasantest
memories of the entire experience are
a few evenings spent in the quarters of
you and your your very Lovely Lady.

Your friend, John A. Lomax
