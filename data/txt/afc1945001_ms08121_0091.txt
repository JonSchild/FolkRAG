A rumor I heard about was clothes rationing. A friend of mine heard a lady tell another lady that she sent down to the rationing board for some sugar  books and by mistake they sent her clothes rationing books instead.
The lady said that on the book it said you could only by $18. worth of clothes for a year. 
Any wise person would know it was a rumor as it never tells on rationing books what they are to be used for, and it never mentions the price of anything that you buy with the stamps.
Pretty soon the rumor got around and everybody started buying clothes, thinking they were to be rationed.
If you were on Halsted when this rumor went around you'd almost be squashed by the crowd rushing to buy clothes and all on account of a silly rumor.
