Mr. John Lomax:

The opposite side is a copy of a letter
I have just written to Mr. Dornbush. I heard from him
some weeks ago, and in reply to his queries, wrote him
on April 10th. Evidently he did not get the letter for
he has just written me saying that he had heard nothing. 
However he state further that they were short on money
and could only pay the railroad fare for four. Any others 
would have to pay their own, and all would have to handle 
their expenses to, from, and at Washington.

There was nothing I could do but refuse; since with the 
exception of two of us the boys are not able to finance
themselves. Our going would also necessitate several 
taking their vacation periods at a time when their
respective and respected employers seem constitutionally
opposed to their doing so; which also entered into the
matter. But the main thing, of course, is that we
will not perform anywhere unless the entire bunch are
on hand.

We have had to change our singer, since the one we had
originally and when you were here, is out of town
practically all the time, and he never could sing worth
a damn, in the first place. We are just breaking in 
the new boy, who has a marvelous voice, but doesn't
know enough of the numbers to be of any help to you
in your recording. We are going to keep working
this Summer, and by next Fall will probably have
a group of numbers that will fit in with your work. 

Sorry we will not see you in Washington, but let me tell
you again how much I appreciate your thinking of us,
and recommending us so highly.
