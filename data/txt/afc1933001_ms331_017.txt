You can buy objects of art. Your can't import culture. It is an outgrowth.

"National greatness is home-made — a home-made material, not exotic, not

Like the National Geographic Society, the Texas Folk-Lore Society is 
forces to exclude from its membership people who will not pay, or are
not able to get somebody else to pay, their dues. Two dollars and a half a 
year is the price. It pays for the annual book issued by the Society.
