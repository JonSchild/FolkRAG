Dear Mrs. Fray:
Recently, while collection old songs in Indiana for the Congressional Library, I saw copies of some of your songs. One of them, a song about the Civil War, I found particularly interesting. I wonder if you would be kind enough to send me a copy of this song for deposit under your name in the Archive of American Folk-Song. You would be making a real contribution to our knowledge of the songs of the past, thereby, especially if you could tell us where the song came from and how long you have known it.

Sincerely yours,
AL:es
