ADVISORY SERVICES FOR PROJECTS
Owing to the complexity and delicacy of the tasks confronting a control 
project, it is the most important [to achieve a balanced control Advisory Board.] for the rumor-control project to seek the guidance and  cooperation of a competent Advisory Board.
This Board should include responsible community officials; [security officers]
representatives of civic and service clubs, womenâ€™s organizations,
labor and farm groups, consumer groups, [and all] minority groups in the
community, technical experts ([such as persons] from the psychology or sociology
department of local colleges or universities) and newspaper and radio
representati[on]ves.

[Though the emphasis in the organization of rumor-control projects
is on their responsibilities as information centers, rumor] The analysis of
rumors will often [may] point to [??] imperfections in real conditions [about which something can be done.] in the community. Persistent rumors about
housing conditions, for example, may simply be the direct result of poor housing.
[Where improving such] The improvement of the housing conditions would eliminate such rumors. [which tend to]
[interfere with the war effort,] The rumor-control project [must consider improving such] can legitimately consider corrective
measures, or the recommendation of corrective measures, as an important part of its responsibility.
[conditions part of tis business. It should therefore, have on its Advisory]
[Board] For this reason the presence of professional social service workers [alert to the possibilities]
[for community action.] on the Advisory Board of the rumor-control project is highly advantageous.

With respect to informational programs, the local [project] rumor-control group is in
the best position to fill the community need. For blanketing [the] non-
local rumors with significant information, the Office of War Information is prepared to cooperate [and] with
local groups by furnishing material designed to meet the information problem presented by [on the basis of analyses sent to the Office.]
rumor analysts.
