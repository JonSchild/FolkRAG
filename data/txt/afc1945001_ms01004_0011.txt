Criticism of the Administration . . . continued

"But for politics we'd have a decent organization of Air Forces. There
have been more of a smae kind of mistakes that happened at Pearl Harbor, only
we don't hear of them openly. The Army and Navy have sound-detectors to spot
airplanes, sure - they had them at Pearl Harbor too - the operator heard planes
and reported it, but nothing was done about it and the men left their posts with-
out doing anything; it will continue to be so unit 'their' is an organization
of Air Forces." (Massachusetts)

Fifth Column

"The great majority of Japanese-American children who attended high schools
in Portland attended private Japanese schools at night so as to familiarize them 
with the language and traditions of Japan." (Oregon)

"German religious groups are at the Cape (Cod) and are trying to push
out other religious groups." (Rhode Island)

"Did you know the German spies who were captured have been secretly set
free?" (Tennessee)

Miscellaneous

labor unions
"Some men who pay fees to join labor unions on installment plan only work
long enough to get their $60, or whatever the amount is paid -- then they are cut
off and other men put on in their place --(who pay fee to join) . . . on defense jobs."
(Georgia)

labor shortage
"In restaurants and taverns all up and down the Willamette valley,
scouts are going in and ordering a cup of coffee or a glass of beer and talking
with the waitresses. They are offering them a bonus, higher wages than they are
getting and a ticket to California if they will come down and work in the San
Francisco area." (Oregon)

"If the government doesn't stop giving relief and old age pensions we
won't be able to get any help. I've trained five cooks in 6 weeks -- and I
don't have one now. There are plenty of jobs for those able to work without
government spending money feeding them." (Georgia)

salvage
"I was told that a woman who sells eggs to Pine Camp could not deliver
more eggs until she could get some egg crates. They, at Pine Camp, refused to
sell her the old egg crates and put them in a pile and burned them." -- (N.Y.)
