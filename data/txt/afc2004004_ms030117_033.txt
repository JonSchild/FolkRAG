Reel 11 Side 1

Reverend Gary Davis

     The song I am about to play now is the song that
come to me when my mother was workin, an she taken sick
three months befo she died.  An this song came to me when
I was lying on my bed.  Came somethin in the room to me:
I thought it was a fowl, or a chicken.  It got on me, and
it was heavy.  Look like I don't know anything I could bring forth
that was heavy as it was.  It got on me and spoke to me
and says, "I has a message."  I bit it in the face, an
it got off and begin to act pitiful.  I broke down an commenced to
cryin.  While I was cryin i t was a little boy came to me.
Had hair as long as he was high.  H ad a French harp in
his mouth an he was blowin straight up, singin this song:
"I'm On My Way Back Home."  (Reverend Davis, before this
song came to you, did you have religion?)  I had backslidden 
from God.  The Lord had called me to preach a long
time ago an I jes wouldn't give up.  (He sings.  His voice
is rough with grief.  Tears pour down his face.)
     I'm on my way back home,
     I'm on my way back home,
     I'm on my way back home,
     Oh those of you have crosses,
     Trials and temptation too,
     But I started to go with Jesus
I am determined to go through.
