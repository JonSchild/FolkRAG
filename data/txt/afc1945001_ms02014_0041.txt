RUMOR
(In a Drug Store)

Recently, while stopping for a few moments in a drug store, 
I overheard two men discussing the Wendell L. Willkie trip abroad.

One said he had heard that the President, when instructing 
Willkie relative to the matters that he should take up in these various 
countries, had authorized him to make the statements with reference to 
creating a new front, and that he was to shout this in the different 
countries to stir up Great Britain and awaken the British to the necessity 
of a second front.

But, this man continued, later the President did not like the 
reaction to the statements of Wendell Willkie and therefore backed up on 
the whole proposition and assumed no responsibility for such statements 
by his representative in Russia and China.  Then Mr. Willkie, of course, 
had to say that he was speaking only as an American citizen, expressing 
his own views, and not as an official of the United States Government 
or as a representative of the President.
