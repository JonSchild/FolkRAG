Macpherson's Lament 

1. Farewell ye dungeons dark and strong 
    Macpherson's day will no be long 
    Below the gallows tree [he hanged] I'll hang.            [*This is from Burns 
                                                                                         but changed*] 
Sae rantingly sae dauntingly 
Sae wantonly went he 
He played a tune and he danced aroun' 
Below the gallows tree.      [*25 secs.*] 
[* All of #2 has a line through it Left to Right *]
2. [Some came her[e] to see me hang 
    And some to [see] buy my fiddle 
    Before that I do part with her 
    I'll break her through the middle. 

    The Laird o' Grant, a Highland Saint 
    That first laid hands on me 
    He played the cause o' Peter Broon 
    Tae let Macpherson dee.                                               [*2nd half of 6th 
                                                                                            stanza, p. 45 
                                                                                            Bothy Songs*] 

Leave off the bands from off my hands 
And bring to me my sword 
But there's no' a man in a' Scotland 
But I'll brave him at his word. 

And what is death but parting breath 
On mony a bloody plain 
For in this place o' my disgrace 
I'll scorn him yet again. 

The reprieve was coming o'er the Brig o' Banff 
To let Macpherson free 
When the put the clock at a quarter before 
And hang him to the tree. 

I have lived a life o' stut and strife 
I have died by treachery; 
But it's my life to live and life 
Than to live in slavery.
