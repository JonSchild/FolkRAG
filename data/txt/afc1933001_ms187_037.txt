Dear Mr. Lomax:

I regret I have been delayed in answering your letter of October 9
relative to the possibility of our cooperating on the Czech Folk-Lore 
project which you wrote me about. Part of my delay is
occasioned by my desire to discuss this matter with Mr. J. Frank
Dobie. He tells me that this past summer one of his students
wrote his thesis for a Master of Arts degree on Czech Folk-Lore
in Texas and that this thesis was finished under Professor 
Boatright in our Department of English. He says he thinks that
thesis worthy of publication and it will likely be published
as one of the volumes of the Texas Folk-Lore Society of which
Mr. Boatright this year is the President.

I doubt whether the University would be able at this time to give 
any financial assistance to the support of Mrs. Svatava Jakobson.
Our Regents at the present time are becoming very economy minded
and they have rather recently turned down a research proposal
to study the folk-lore of the oil industry in Texas. So I think
it would be doubtful whether they would be interested in promoting
a project in Czech Folk-Lore. I shall be glad, however, to keep
the matter in mind, and if there is anything that we can do about
it later I shall be glad to talk over with you.

With kindest regards, I am

Very cordially yours,
Homer P. Rainey
Homer P. Rainey, President
