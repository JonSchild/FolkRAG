STURM, IRENE     [*A*] 

Connections of the War Gossips. 

The are rumors going around with the
students that the Japs have gotten down 
further in the Aleutian Islands and have
now gained a foot hold in Alaska! 

T'was at a ball I met him
I knew he was a "Jap," 
By the slanting of his eyebrows,
And the curling of his "Yap." 

He seemed to be a smart guy, 
And talked of Uncle Sam; 
When there appear upon the spot, 

(I forget the rest.) 

Bring in Scrap
Lick the Jap! 

Description of a Jap! : 
"A Dilapidated sack of petrified bones!"
