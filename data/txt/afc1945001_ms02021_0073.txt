           Conversation between two federal employees:
           "I believe that the Negroes in India have been exploited for many years by powerful and wealthy firms in England. We all know that the English Government has condoned mistreatment of people in their possessions for centuries. These English firms exploit the poor for all they are worth. It seems that India is telling them where to head in at now and England has finally come to a point where she must pay for her sins. Just compare the loyalty of the Filipinos with the loyalty of the people of India. The United States has always treated the Filipinos as they should be treated and if England could truthfully make the same statement perhaps she would be in a better position to secure their cooperation. In my opinion the proud British Empire is a thing of the past. If they intend to keep Japan from taking India they had better give India what she wants."
