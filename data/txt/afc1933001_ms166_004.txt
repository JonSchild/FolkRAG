Dear Alan, 

Forgive me for neglecting, because of the plethora
of holidays recently, your pre-Christmas letter. 
Because of arbitrary but, I assure you, quite
necessary organizational policy, this whole project
you and I have been discussing for two years and 
more would now have to be realized not by me but 
by Mr. Manie Sacks, in charge of the Popular Division. 
I have talked the matter over with him and you may 
expect to hear presently from either me or him. 

With best wishes for the New Year and why-in-the hell-
don't-you-call-me-when-you-get-to-New-York, I am 

Cordially yours, 
Moe

Mr. Alan Lomax
