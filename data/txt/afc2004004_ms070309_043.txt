Prayer service - until 11.
Preach - 30 minutes,. 
About 5 to 12 - everyone would
kneel - [someone would] then secret prayer
for 10 minutes - then a leader would
lead out in prayer.
Then song & giving right hand 
of fellowship.
Then eat for an hour
Then preach & prayer and sing
until day clean.
No marching about in the services 
I saw.
Nowadays they meet at 11 and 
dismiss [about] after 12.
These late ministers carry on according to 
the book - not the spirit.
"The old year [pu] buries itself in
eternity and the new year takes
authority."
30 yrs ago. November - Thanksgiving service
Began 11 Used to carry something
of all the produce, punkin, Irish potatoes, birds in cages,
put it around the altar. Real good
times - they aren't particular about 
doing anything nowadays
