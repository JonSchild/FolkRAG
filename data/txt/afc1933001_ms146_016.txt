[*A*]  June 12, 1939

Mr. R. P. Wetherald
Recording and Record Sales
RCA Manufacturing Co. Inc.
Camden, New Jersey

Dear Mr. Wetherald:

This is in answer to your letter of June 7 addressed to Mr. 
Carl Engel, former chief of the Music Division. Mr. Engel resigned
on June 30, 1934 and is now president of G. Schirmer, Inc. Let me
assure you that we shall be very glad to advise you to the best of
our abilities in the matter of American folk music.

I suppose that in referring to Mr. Oscar Spevak you mean me.
Colonel C. L. Bouv√© is the Register of Copyrights and he will be
very glad to advise you on this phase of the work. Mr. Alan Lomax
is the assistant-in-charge of out Archive of American Folk-Song. 
Mr. Lomax, by the way, will be in Camden to visit Mr. Forman and
Mr. Walker the first part of next week. You might want to speak
to him then. I might add that Mr. John Lomax, Honorary Consultant
and Curator of the Archive, and a pioneer in the field of American
folk songs, will also be in Washington the latter part of this
month. 

I regret, however, that the dates you set are rather inconvenient
since I shall probably have to be out of town at that time.
If you cannot change the date, however, do not hesitate to come to
the Library as my assistant, Mr. Edward Walters, will be very glad
to introduce you to the various men named above.

Very sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
