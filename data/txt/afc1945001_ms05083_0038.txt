"I was talking with a bunch of young fellows home on furlough who had 
been in camps in the east. They said there was a lot of carousing and drinking 
among the officers and higher-ups of the units composed of old National Guard 
groups. They said this didn't pertain to the regular Army, but that the Guard 
units generally are doing too much drinking and carousing with women to be 
very good military leaders." Aug. 8 - Labor lawyer [*Iowa 8*]
