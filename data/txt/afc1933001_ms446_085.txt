70 

Through heat and cold I've often gone--
Through sorrow and distress, 
To call on sinners to repent, 
And see the Savior's face. 

My brother preachers boldly speak, 
Who stand on Zion's walls ; 
confirm the strong, revive the weak, 
And after sinners call.  
May Zion's sons in peace be bound, 
And put their foes to flight ; 
While I am sleeping under ground, 
May you in love unite. 

My brethren all, I bid adieu,
Your fellowship I love ; 
In time I'll never more see you,
But soon we'll meet above. 

My little babes be near my heart, 
For nature seems to bind 
So strong it grieves me to depart, 
And leave them all behind. 

Dear Lord !  a father to them be, 
And shield them from all harm ; 
That they may know and worship thee, 
And dwell upon thy arm. 

My loving wife, my bosom friend--
The object of my love--
The time's been sweet on earth with you,
My sweet and harmless dove ! 

My dear,  you've often looked for me,
And often seen me come, 
But now I must depart from thee, 
And never more return. 

My dearest love, don't week for me,
