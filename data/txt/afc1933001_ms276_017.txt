Symphony No. 6 (Surprise) by
Joseph Haydn (1732-1809)

The Symphony in 'G' major, popularly known as the 'Surprise' Symphony 
belongs to the first group of six works written for the London violinist
and impressario Salomon. It was Salomon who, upon hearing of the death
of Haydn's patron, Prince Esterhazy, induced him to come to England.
The visit was a triumph and Haydn received not only honors but an immense
sum of money. He received from Oxford the honorary degree of Doctor of
Music, upon which occasion the Symphony of the set now known as the
'Oxford' was played. He returned home and two years later again came to
England with six more symphonies and again the same success.  He returned
to settle for the rest of his life in Vienna, not only much richer but
more appreciated. He himself said that it was only after becoming famous
in England that he became famous in Germany. (Beethoven, while a pupil
of Haydn probably heard much good about England, which may be the reason
it was always to him a promised land.)

Twelve symphonies for two trips to England! Today one symphony is
a matter of months and years, but as one writer aptly remarks in those
days symphonies grew as painlessly as beards! Haydn once said anyone
could look at his face and tell he was a jolly man. He could very well
have said 'Listen to my Surprise Symphony and you will know I am a jolly
man' for the work, almost throughout is one of jolly good humor. It is
scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, tympani,
and the usual string quintet, and was first performed in London, March 23,
1792.

The first movement proper is preceded by a short Adagio Cantabile,
3/4 time. This introduction is not the introduction of a Beethoven or
Brahms, striving as it were to pierce the veil of the unknown, rather it
is an aperitif. Over a held keynote-'G'-in the horns, the oboes and
bassoons intone a tender little phrase, which is answered rather sadly
by the strings-once again the oboes and bassoons, this time joined by the
flutes, sing their little phrase and the strings continue, trying very
hard to be serious but they seem to know that there is fun in store for
them. And there is a pause followed by a few descending notes in the
violins, and another pause, and then the sprightliest of Allegros.
(Allegro Vivace, 6/8 time). The second theme, which is slightly syncopated
races along in much the same style as the first. True to the
traditions of the day it is in the dominant (Dmajor key). It is heard
approximately two-thirds of the distance on the first face. The conventional
repeat of the exposition is omitted, and the second face starts
the development, which after the manner before Beethoven is short and unpretentious.
Once more is heard the first theme and the syncopated second
theme, this time in the tonic (G major) and the instruments chase along
merrily to the end of the movement.

The second movement, the 'Title' movement, is in 'C' major, 2/4 time,
and is in variation fern. The first and second violins play the theme 
staccato and piano while the other strings accent the first beat. The
first violins alone then play the theme while the second violins join the
other strings in a pizzicato accompaniment, this time more softly. Then
in full orchestra a loud chord. It is the surprise! We of today are
disappointed but it doesn't matter. In its day it as highly effective.
Haydn was annoyed by having his audience going to sleep during the slow
movements, so he set a trap for them. The first time, soft-- (Ah, a good
time to go to sleep) The second time, -- still softer-- (Almost asleep)
