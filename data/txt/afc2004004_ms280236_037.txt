Lomax: Explain the origin of that song, if you can. I mean. . .
Robts: It's got no origin. Like him!
Man A: I first heard that in the Surrey Docks, London.
Lomax: How long ago was that?
Man A: O that'd be 1935 - 6, time. That'd be 17 years ago.
Robts: 1935! You must have been over 80!
Lomax: Is that a barge - sailing-barge song?
Robts: Old sailormen's song.
Man A: Yes, old sailormen's song, originally.
Lomax: God, that's a smasher.

1) We were lying in the Surrey Dock on day,
The mate knew that it was time to get under way,
Chorus: Stormy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys,
When the wind blows our barge will go.
2) He's homeward bound but he's out of luck,
For the skipper's half drunk in the Docg and Duck.
3) Then the skipper came on board with a girl on his arm,
He's going to give up barging, and take a farm.
4) The cook ran for'ard and the mate fell in the dock,
And thr skipper caught his fingers in the main jib-block.
5) At last we're off down Limehouse Reach,
When the leeboards knocked on Greenwich beach.
6) We shoved her off, and away we go,
But the skipper's got a bottle of beer below.
7) She fills away and she sails like heck,
But there ain't no bargeman up on deck.
8) There's a crash and a bump and she's ashore,
The skipper says, "Christ, we're on the Nor!"
9) Then up jumped a mermaid covered in slime,
We took her down the foc'sle and had a good time.
