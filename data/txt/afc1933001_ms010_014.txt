between Dec 5- 7 to see you and 
Mr. Leland. I shall also write 
to him. Should you be away 
between those dates please leave 
me world  on any point that 
may seem helpful, particularly 
relating to the expense of shipping 
the machine or Mr. Leland.

I am sorry for the mix-up 
in these letters.

Sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax
