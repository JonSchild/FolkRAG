Folks Song 2

 Last time I tried to give [my]
 you in rough outline a picture 
of the regions in America folk
song. This [???] was also a 
much simplified historical picture.
   American folk song development. 
It is still up to ourselves to 
fill in the gaps of these pictures.  In 
order to do this profitably we must
adopt same pt. of view of analysis of
the material.  This pt. of view has
to be dynamic in nature - since
we are now interested in 
tracing a line of development.  We 
must become adepts at weighing the
host of factor operative in any single
situation for or against the preservation 
the decay, the growth of material. 
One of these factors, for instance, is 
a combination of isolation & 
habit (Ex - Stubblefield).  Disap. of 
secular music in Coshama Co. (Ex). 
Persistence of work song in prisons.
