TAPE 15, SIDE II (CONT.)

"The Man Who Spoiled his Bride" and "How the Devil Married a
Pretty Girl"

Explanation of the devil story and talk about her first reactions
to it.

Christ and the robbers, a retelling of the Bible stories.

"You got to git hard" to steal; knowing oneself; believing in
oneself; believing in Christ.
