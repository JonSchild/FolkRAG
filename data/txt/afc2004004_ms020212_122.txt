Dear Alan,
     The finest bluegrass group I have ever seen is coming to
New York at Gerde's Folk City beginning June 4.  The Dillards
will be on with Rita Weill, an excellent ballad singer.  The
reason I'm writing is that the Dillards will be on "The Andy
Griffith Show" on March 18.  If you will take time to see them
I think it will be worth it.  I would appreciate it as Mike
is hiring two unknown acts and needs support.
Sincerely,
Edwin Pearl
