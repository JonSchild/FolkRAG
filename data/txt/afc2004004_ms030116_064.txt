Rev. and Mrs. D. sing, after guitar opening.

Johnny F:  Rev. D:, one time (his tender, dreamy, voice which seems
almost on the verge of tears, so throbbing with sentiment is it)
-- down in Texas -- at al lil ole backwoods place -- they raised an
ole hymn -- an how did it go?  You run on it.  In yo sermon theah you
were touchin on it.  "I heard of a city called heaaaaaaammmmmmnnnnnn. . ."
Mrs. D:  I think I know --
Johnny:  The spirit was so high -- I never will forgit it -- that
all of em -- the preacher cryin like a baby -- "Sometimes I am tossed
an driven --"
(handwritten in margin:  Effect on people)
Rev. D:  Yeah but boy you wait till you heah m e git off like that. Don't
be in the church when I g it off.  I ain't in shape to fool wid.
Mrs. D:  Sometimes you'll heah em scream.  I say, Lawd! you'll think
you're down in the country someplace.
Rev. D:  When I git like that I ain't fix to fool wid.  God!
Johnny:  That's what happens when the spirit really hits you.  Don't
tell me you can tell what your g onna do.
Rev. D:  You don't know what you're doin.
Johnny:  Precious Morris you know when the preacher would git up there
in the short rows anybody that could reach her would just haveto
hold onto her.
