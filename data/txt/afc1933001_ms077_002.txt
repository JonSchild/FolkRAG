DIVISION OF MUSIC  12/17/1940

Dear Mr. Spinacke:
The starred * items 
might be considered for 
your album. The entire 
list I suggest for copying 
when , as and if ever
at any time the Right Honorable
Mr. Macfaish gets
time and inclination 
to hear them. It would be 
economical to copy in 
each case the entire record 
for your permanent files.
Yours obediently,
JohnA. Lomax
