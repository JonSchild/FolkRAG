Console, [crossed out] Agwete, Console,
Console, Adamerci, console,
La Place-o, console-o.   l'axx

Be consoled, Agwete, be consoled,
Be consoled, Adamerci, be consoled,
La Place, he [crossed out] will console (you).

The above song was said to have been composed when Theoline and Dodo, the La Place of the hounfort, had quarreled. Theoline sat weeping in her house, despairing of ever seeing Dodo again and not knowing which way to turn since it is thought that without the proper La Place no houngan can work effectively. Her hounsis sat about her and tried to comfort her and in the end made up the song.

The last song that I was able to record during the evening was addressed to the servitors by the mombo, reproaching them for their failings. It is evidently a favorite with Theoline since she sang the next day at the Casser Gateaux Ceremony.

A Zepaules. (49B4)

Theoline, mombo cay moin,
Hounsi-a malouque-o
Quand m'alle, ou 'a songe,
Quand m'alle, ou 'a songe,
Hounsi-a malouque-o

Theoline is mombo of my house,
Good for nothing hounsis,
When I go, you will remember,
[Crossed out] When I go you will remember,
Good for nothing hounsis.
