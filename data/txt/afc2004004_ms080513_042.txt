A     All these - all this growth are unforced.
People are neighbours in the same place.  They 
see ah what ah these ah somewhat strange
people have that they like, and they - they
do it themselves.  They want to join their
[*INFLUENCES*]     neighbours in their amusements and their art.
[*[*] So there's a gradual taking over of other
things.  It's never imitation, because as
they  -as, as the whites adopted black style, 
they adopted too an already very ripened and
very sophisticated dance style and musical
style that they had themselves.  So that
certain alements of the black style come into
it.  But as you can see here at Maggie Valley,
with these cloggers, they're not ah - they're 
not so fluid in the middle body.  They are 
a little stooped, some of them, and their
arms are beginning to, to ah, ah, have that
sort of loose flowing rhythm, ah, that the
blacks have.  And their feet are sliding.
They're getting a lot more syncopation and
a lot more tricky rhythms in because of that [*]*] 
And they, they're they - that's the flatfoot
style, that's the most popular thing in the
South, in the backwoods South today.
