Tennessee Field Representative

Response has been very poor in connection with the collection of
rumors for the rumor report requested by you on October 1.

We find that, regardless of careful explanation of the purpose
of the report and the disposition to be made by us of the collection
of rumors, individuals had it in the back of their minds that we were
asking them to report or spy on their friends or customers.  It seemed
to them to smack slightly of the Gestapo, so even those who agreed to
report at the end of the week advised that they had heard no rumors.
Most are willing to tell rumors to you but not to write them.

We asked the following types of persons to collect rumors for us:
Memphis
Beauty parlor operator
Neighborhood drug store proprietor and manager
Secretary of the Memphis Chamber of Commerce
A laborer in a local defense plant.
Dentist.

Nashville
Secretary of the Kiwanis Club.
Proprietor and manager of a neighborhood drug store.
Policeman.
Manager of a barber shop.

Chattanooga
Worker at the Volunteer Ordnance Plant.
A policeman.

Knoxville
Woman textile mill worker.
Beauty parlor operator.
