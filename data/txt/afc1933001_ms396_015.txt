"You know this Professor fellow didn't know even this much about trail law," he shouted to his mates, "But I'm not goin' tompoke my face up to his blamed old horn and sing. The tune sin't much nohow".

    (Sing a few stanzas)
  The morning after my adventure at the White Elephant Saloon, I found an old blind ballad singer twangling his guitar and whining out doleful ditties as he listened to the ring of quarters in his tin cup.
"I don't know any cowboy songs", he said, " but lend me home to lunch. My wife can sing you a bookful." I held his arm as he shuffled along beside me. Often I stumbled over the rough places for I was carrying an Eidson recording machine. They built them strong and heavy in 1909.
  We found his wife out behind a covered truck, a forerunner of the trailer, seated in front of [a] gaily colored tent. She wore a gypay costume, richly brocedddd and she had used paint and powder with a skillful discretion on a face naturally comely. Shi[leflchinnedswith] her, the old man disappeared into the tent. In a few minutes, out he came. Gone were the round, humped shoulders, the white hair, the [dhribbing g[?]nt], the tottering figure. Before me stood a handsome, [darkagryssman], alert and athletie. Be made no explanation. He was a perfect faker.
  My wife shakes down the sape who like to hold her hand while she reads their fortunes in the stars. Al lthe self-righteous fools go away
