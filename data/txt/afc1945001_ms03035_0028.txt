Union Slowdown of War Production

Radio station manager: "We service Champion Spark Plugs with
wired music. The company said the music was fine, was helpful in making
employes satisfied, but August 10 our contact with the company told us of
a new woman who was put to work on a machine and the first day did 5,000 [*7b*]
units. The second day she was down to 2,000 and reported that a union
steward had directed her to make only 2,000 as that was standard. The
company replaced her with a new man. He made 5,000 the first day and was
told by the same union to cut to 2,000. The new man was an FBI agent and
the steward was fired."

work for too many."
James Swinehart, most reliable observer on The Detroit News,

natural ability and desire of the men to produce."
