- leaving the bare bones of the story.
What you had left was a story of 
love - called exactly that by 
our S. mt. singers. As the people
went West, these ballads thinned out - 
they were there + we know it - but
their fancied, seemed less read + important 
in the face of the awe-inspring realities 
of the Western landscape.  Their place
in the affections of the masses of England
+ the U.S. had already been threatened
by the broadside ballad, caller finicky scholars - significantly 
the vulgar ballad.  and it was on 
this model that our new ballads
were by and large made.  Cecil Sharpe
and many other collectors have told
us that for the folk singer one of 
the touch stones of a good ballad
 was it's truth.  These newtypes
The English broadside + its frontier relative 
seemed true to the experience
of American singers -- that is 
they functioned within the range
of his field of interests move
logically than did the old songs.
