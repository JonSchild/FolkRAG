own, I think is asking quite too 
much. I can't agree to such 
a proposition.

A Columbia circular 
of 125000 copies is much 
more apt to start suits than 
a book, and a big corporation, 
under the prejudices nurtured 
against them, is easy 
pickings. I can understand why 
they would wish to get from 
under; but they must be satisfied 
with your guarantee (they could 
withhold your pay if suit is brought) 
I cannot sign the papers when, 
as and if they come and I hope 
you can see the reasonableness 
of my refusal.
