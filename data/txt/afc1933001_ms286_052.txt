13 B1 . Long John. Sung by "Lightning" and a gang of Negro Convicts,
Darrington State Prison Farm, Sandy Point, Texas.  Recorded by 
John A. and Alan Lomax.

The axes flash up in unison; bite into the log in unison as the 
leader sings" 

"It's a long John."

The axes in their shining arcs make "rainbows round" the striped 
shoulders.  Up again in unison; in unison the fresh chips fly 
out of the oak log, as the chorus yells back:

"It's a long John."

On this record of Negro axemen singing in the hot woods of the 
South you hear the process by which the rich land was cleared
for cultivation.  These men could endure long hours of hard-
driving work in the sun, could sing as they worked, pouring a
new language and new ideas into the old African leader-chorus
form. The wildness and savage joy of this work song come from the 
 leader, who was nicknamed "Lightning" because he could move faster, 
sing better, laugh louder and make wittier remarks than any other 
man on the farm.  The song is the sketch of a man whom Lightning
greatly admired, a legendary character, named Long John, who out-ran
the police, the sheriff, the deputies with all their bloodhounds
and got away from jail to freedom.  The song is a picture
of the chase, but full of puns (about John of the Bible), full of
double-meanings and asides.
