Dear Doctor Posnansky:

Doctor Ralph Boggs has informed me that you are trying to
arrange to record a folk-drama to be performed in La Joya on December
8th. It may be possible for the Archive of American Folk-Song of the
Library of Congress to make materials and equipment available for
this enterprise. This depends on a number of factors including
perhaps most importantly that of transportation of materials to
Bolivia in time. I should appreciate your making a formal application
to me for the materials you think you will need to record this folk-
drama. Specifically, the length of time the recording will take and
the number of feet and dimensions of film you will wish to use. If
in addition you would be interested in further recording in the region, 
add your comments about this in as much detail as convenient.
Indicate also the official sponsorship for your project and write a
paragraph about your background.

There are several questions I want to have answers for. 1) Will
the recording take place any where near a source of electricity? If
not, could you borrow a reliable portable motor generator delivering
110 volts of alternating current? 2) Is there a portable recording
machine available in Bolivia that you could borrow, since the chief
difficulty will probably be the shipment of a machine to La Paz?
3) What part of the project could you or your local sponsors finance
yourselves? For instance, if we were to furnish the machine and the
original disks and film, could you pay for copies of this material 
for the local collection?

Let me hear from you by air mail as soon as convenient. In the
meanwhile, I shall look into the matter of transportation.

Sincerely yours,
