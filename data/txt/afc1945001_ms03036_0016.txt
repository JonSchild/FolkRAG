Our Government is not telling us enough about what is going
on in the war.
Cigar Store Proprietor, St. Paul, 8/10 [*3*]

We cannot believe the Russians, we cannot believe the Germans
and our Government is not giving us enough information so we don't know
what is happening in the war. [*3*]
Lawyer, St. Pauls, 8/10

Everything about the war is propaganda; we don't know what's
going on. [*3*]
Common Laborer, St. Paul, 8/10

I have lost confidence in the price ceiling program, because
prices are still going up.  My grocery bill is going up right along.
Shoe Store Proprietor, St. Paul, 8/10

I don't think the price ceiling program is working because I
have to pay more for groceries.
Housewife, St. Paul, 8/10

The price ceiling program is a lot of monkey business, it is 
not working because farm products are not controlled.
Grocer, St. Paul, 8/10

The pressure groups are keeping prices up.  The farm bloc and
the labor bloc are responsible for this with the political pressure they
are putting on Congress. 
Businessman, St. Paul, 8/10

There is too much political pressure from labor bosses and
unions, that is why we cannot stop inflation.
Salesman, St. Paul, 8/10
