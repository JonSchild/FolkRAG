Dear Dr. Horowitz:

I apologize for answering your letter of
July 14th with so much delay, but I was out of town.

Please find enclosed a copy of Dr. Mintz'
article on "Russian Mass Communication and Psychology
in the U. S. S. R."

No further steps have been taken in the
rumor study. I am waiting for two term papers by
graduate students. As soon as I have these, I shall
see Dr. Gardner Murphy again and discuss plans
with him.

Our former volunteer associate is Mr. George
A. Nelson, Jr. He is now with the Army, but a letter
to him in care of his father, Mr. George A. Nelson,
Stevens-Nelson Paper Corporation, 109 East 31st Street,
New York City, would undoubtedly be forwarded.

Under separate cover I am sending you a copy
of our latest Research Paper, "Data on a German Defeat
Situation," which, though it does not bear directly on
rumor, may still be useful to you. I also enclose a
reprint of a paper of mine in which I discuss planted
news as a certain kind of rumor. It is one which has
greatly increased of late.

Yours very sincerily,

Ernst Kris
