Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 10
"Great stores of equipment are being piled in the open near railroad yards. Hundreds of jeeps crated and covered with paper stores in the open. This paper will not protect this equipment [*1*] from rain and snow and it is only a question of time until it will be damaged from exposure. No one seems to know why they are stored here. Neither the railroads nor the army seem to have any knowledge as to where this equipment is going. It is just another case of working to produce equipment and then letting it deteriorate by side tracking it some place."
Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 12
"It is pathetic that in all these years of threatened war that we are so unprepared. Troops have been sent to isolated places [*1*] all over the globe without sufficient planning. It now seems that we do not have sufficient shipping and as a result our boys are not receiving the necessary food and supplies."
