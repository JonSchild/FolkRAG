he was talkin'. "Just don't stay with you" and all like that...
I didn' [know] hear; I didn't said to the man, 'cause I sat
double up on the floor, in the fireplace, you know, down at the
fireplace, playin' a puzzle. An' I heard him tol' her at the 
do', an' the Lord let me remember that, said that, said that, ah, "If that
don't do," Said, "You go to the drug store and get Milk Tonic
No. 1." I never bought none; I never forget what he said. See?
That was sumpin' to destroy this chile, see? He said, "If that
don' do--" he had two lil' bottles of med'cin. Well Betty
said to me, said, "I'm gonna give you some [milk] m'cin for your col'.
"It'll keep you so you won't have no col'; an' you keep col'
out you an' [then] you be strong." All right. An' I don' wanna
take it, you see. If I [had] taken that dose of m'cin--the

before ya' eat. Next day was Monday. Mama sent me there to

it!" You know,             make you do a thing,

An so I...I didn' wanna take it. Sumpin' was tellin' me in
my mind I didn' want that stuff. I didn' know what was for,
you know? Didn' know nothin' about no destroyer. But I jus'
didn' wanna take it. An' I leaned up on the table; I went to
cryin'. I didn't want to take it. I wanted outrun her, an' 
go back home, an' fin' Mama back home. Straight down the
railroad track. An' I didn wanna take the med'cin. So [finally] while
I laid up on this table cryin'...the dog barked...an' I looked
