Warn't no shindigs at the ranches, as they have them nowa-days,
With a lot of purty cowgals fur to jine in the hoorays,
Whar the music of the fiddle started every heart to prance,
An' the gods of fun and frolic ruled the sperrit of the dance.
Then we lived in tonts an' dugous, jost some blankets fur 
our beds
Used our saddles then fur pillows onto which to lay our hoads,
An' our rifles an' our pistols rights beside us we would lay,
So's to git 'em poco pronto if the Injuns made a play.
