October 16, 1942


To: All Bureau Chiefs and Heads of Divisions

From: Vernon McGee


There are rumors running throughout the city, some of which are not
verified, that Memorial Bridge across the Potomac has been or will be closed
due to the high water. Major Kelly has informed me that the police have not
been notified of any danger at Memorial Bridge and have no schedule for closing
it. The river is six feet below the danger point and it is unlikely that the
river will rise that much. Due to the prevalence of the rumors throughout the
city it is probable that traffic this afternoon to Virginia will be jammed.
Please explain the matter to the chiefs of your division and if it is desirable
people residing in Virginia may be released earlier than usual in order to
scatter the traffic on the roads.
