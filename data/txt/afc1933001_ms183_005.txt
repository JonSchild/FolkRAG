Dear Dr. Chappell:
I am driving out to Indiana on the
27th of this month, and I would very much like
to drop by for a visit with you at that time.
There are a number of things I would like to discuss
with you, and you are almost the only active
collector in the country that I don't know well.
I am very anxious to remedy this situation.  Let
me know if you will be in town.
Very sincerely,
Alan Lomax
