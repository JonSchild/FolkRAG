NO MORE MOURNIN'

Some say the Negro people made this song when
they were slaves because they had to believe that
someday they would be free. Some say they began
to sing it after the Civil War. Now it belongs to
white people as well as Negroes. The sharecroppers
and tenant farmers sing it in the South where [together] they
are working and fighting for another kind of freedom.

Negro and white
([The] sharecroppers and tenant farmers sing it in
