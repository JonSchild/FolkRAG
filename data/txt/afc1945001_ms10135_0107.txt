The Story I heard was about a man
who was in the Army and he told of a narrow
escape with the Japs.  It was one day the General and 
his troop were out scouting around looking for the
enemy and were spied by them which started
trouble.  they had a lot of equipment with them,
had mules with packs on their backs.  I just 
can't recall what it was these mules were carrying
but, any way, the onliest trail they had to
follow back to camp were blocked by the Japs, 
then they had to fall out in troops to shoot
their way back to camp.  One man that was
keeping up with the mules had let it stray away
to far and when he went to get it, he was stabbed
in the back by a bayonet from the Japs and
such a scream you never heard before.  It really 
frightened me and made me feel sad also and the
music was playing soft and low with the bugle
blowing.  Well, the men at the camp had given
this Army up, when one day they all came back
with heads hanging low and victory over
what they had sought.
