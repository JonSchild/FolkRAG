C-OS             MEMORANDUM
OFFICE OF THE
LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS
Mr. Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Folk Song Project                          July 2, 1938
I quote from a letter to the Librarian from Mr. George Palmer Putnam, 10042
Valley Spring Lane, North Hollywood, California, dated June 30, 1938, as follows:
"It is in connection with a certain writing project that I am
venturing this letter to bother you for a bit of information. I remember
meeting a man some years ago who I think was connected with
the Library of Congress. His interest was the songs and general folk-
lore of the Appalachian regions. If my recollection is correct, either
he himself had collected, or he knew about, the phonographic recordings
of many of the old songs, ballads, etc., of the mountain people. I
presume such a collection was accumulated for, and presumably now
exists, in the Library.
"If this be true, I would like to get such information as is convenient
about this material. Approximately what does it embrace? Can
it be seen - or heard - other than by going to the Library itself? In
what form is material, other than such recordings, of the mountain music?
"What I want is to make some selection of folk songs, pioneer music
and the like, to be woven into a really lovely picture-story which is
being developed against the locale of the southeastern  mountain country.
"If you will turn this over to someone with whom I can correspond,
I will be most grateful. ..."
If you can make some suggestions in this connection, I shall be very
glad, in acknowledging the letter for the Librarian, to transmit them to Mr.
Putnam.
