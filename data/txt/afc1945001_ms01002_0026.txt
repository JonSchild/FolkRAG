(Insert at the bottom of page 7, ruuning on this is not a new paragraph)
It should not be necessary to inquire concerning the names of the people
spreading rumors unless there is suspicion that the individual is purposely 
sabotaging the war effort. If this be the case the problem is
one for the appropriate law enforcement authorities rather than a rumor
control project. There should be no need for investigating individual 
rumors to discover how they might have arisen. The important thing is 
to have rumors reported so that the project directors can evaluate the
informational gaps in the community's program. Inasmuch as this is the
objective of the rumor reporting, the problem immediately becomes one
of the prevalence of rumors in the community and their significance for
the general program rather than the historical origin of a particular 
rumor. This should be made clear both to the special rumor reporting
staff and those general reporters in the community at large who may be 
contributing "unsolicited" rumors.
