Miss. Marjorie Edgar
Citel Hospital,
Loring park,
Minneapolis, Minn.

Dear Miss Edgar:

I was terribly sorry to learn that you were ill and in the hospital and that your folk-lore work will not be carried on during the Summer.

It is certainly very generous of you to offer to help me with the Hiberderdian songs and as soon as I know definitely when I shall be near Duluth ,I  will let you know. That, however, will probably not be before the first of September unless my plans change.

I am already in touch with Dr. Bleegen who has kindly offered his cooperation in my work this summer. Of course it will be impossible for me to make an adequate study of the Finnish folk songs but I would like to record a few good examples for the archive so that visiting musicologists will be able to find out more or less what there is available in Minnesota. Perhaps in view of that approach, you may change your mind about the advisability of my visiting any of your Finnish informants, however, I certainly do not wish to pass you in this regard since I fully appreciate your hesitancy in the matter.

Thanking you for your kind letter, I am

Sincerely yours,
