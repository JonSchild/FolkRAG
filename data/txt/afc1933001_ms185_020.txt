Mr. Richard Chase
Glade Springs, Va.

Dear Mr. Chase:

Mr. Lomax is in the field and has
therefore been unable to answer your
letter of July 14. He has asked me to
let you know that since he last communicated
with you a policy has been adopted
which makes it necessary to withdraw
that offer. During the present fiscal
year expenditures will be made for recording
projects only if they contribute
directly to the war effort.

In regard to Horton Barker, it might
be a good idea to write a letter to
Dr. Spivacke, Chief of our Music Division,
giving full information about Mr. Barker
and explaining the contribution you feel
he could make to camp entertainment.
Dr. Spivacke is working with some of the
entertainment committees and might be able
at some time to make good use of this information.

Sincerely yours,

Assistant,
Archive of American Folk Song
