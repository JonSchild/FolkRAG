as I realy wanted to have a 
talk with you.  the following
songs which is listed in our letter
of agree ment of Dec. 1959 were
never put on re cord or at least
I never got a copy.  Texas Rangers
down in Ark.  the Titanic, Jessie James
and bury me Neath the willow tree
I could not reach the Prestige
record co by phone.  so maybe
they are gone out.  if these are
on record would love to have
copies for my colection.
Write me some time and tell me
if it is ok to re-record the
material I did with you

love 
AlMeda Riddle
