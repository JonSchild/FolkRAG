Dear Mr. Butterfield:

     Your pleasure in the Smoky Mountain Melody album certainly
delighted me. There is a long story back of that album, and
I'd like to tell it to you in brief. The first part is the
story of how my father, in the early part of this century,
brought American folk songs to the attention of the general
public in his lectures and publications. The second part is
the founding and growth of the Archive of the American Folk Song
in the Library of Congress, in the process of which my father
and myself and a number of other collectors have brought into
the Library 5,000 double-sided 12-inch disc recordings of
American folk songs, amounting to more than 20,000 items of 
music, from the South, the Middle West, New England, the
Southwest, the West, South America, and so forth: Negro chain
gang songs, Negro sermons, the whole range of mountain balladry
and dance music, the occupational songs of the cowboy, the
lumberjack, the miner and so on, hoodoo songs, folk tales,
vaquero ballads, etc. These records are now on file in the
Library, and the Carnegie Corporation has given us engineers
and equipment so that the records may be dubbed or pressed and
made available to the general public.
      As a part of our research into the living folk music of
the United States on records, we undertook in 1938 and 1939 to
make a preliminary survey of American folk music on commercial
records. With that in mind I spent a considerable period of 
time auditioning commercial records in New York, Camden and
here. I must have listened to 3,000 odd records, all of which
were chosen in advance for interest, and out of these I picked
four or five hundred which had special interest. This group
I further compressed into a selected list of folk song records
which was mimeographed and published by the State Department, 
and a copy of which is enclosed. [*you have already seen*]
