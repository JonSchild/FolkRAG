Oh give me the land
When the bright diamond sand.
Throws its light on the glittering stream,
When glideth a long
The graceful White Swan.
LIke a maid in her heavenly dream.

Oh give me the gale
Of this Soloman vale.
When the Life stream of buoyancy flows.
On the Banks of the Beaver
When seldom if ever.
Any Poisonous herbage doth grow.

I love the wild Flowers
In this bright land of ours
I love too. the wild curlew's scream.
The Bluffs, and White Rocks.
And Antelope flocks.
That graze on the Mountains so Green.
