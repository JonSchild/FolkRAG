Ella Speed

L.B says that not long before he moved to Dallas
Bill Martin shot down Ella Speed in the streets and that he,
along with the other musicians of that territory,[wrote up the ballad]
composed this ballad. We doubt whether this story would be 
borne out by the true history of the tragedy, but
[nevertheless it is interesting to note]L.B's belief
in the nearness of the tragedy to his own life is characteriestic 
of ballad-making.

There is no doubt that L.B. "rhymed up" some of the stanzas 
of the present version. Certainly the [remark]explanatory
remarks [of his]are his: - the characterization of Bill Martin
"as a puffessional gambler", who, as L.B. told me [only]
[today]killed Ella Speed because [his]he had been losing[steadily] 
at coon-can; and of Ella Speed as one of the "star women"
that is [is one]a woman, who occupied a [similar] position in[Negro]
the Negro similar to group [women as popular young matron in] similar to
that of a popular young matron in New York society;
his advice "to all the boys", "please don' kill no women--
--- ' cause they'll put you under the ground. On certain
occasions, with the proper audience and the requisite amount
of gin and sugar, L.B. sings a much fuller a more detailed
version than is presented here.

It is interesting to notice that L.B. the "Come-all-ye"
stanza has lost its importance in [L.B.'s estimation.]
"Ella Speed". L.B. never uses it as his first stanza,
more  often leaves it out entirely.  The fourth and [thir]sixteenth 
stanzas are very like a stanza L.B. uses in his Frankie
ballad. The [ninth] twelfth stanza is straight out of the ballad that
[id] is variously called "Boston Burglar", "Po' Boy","Coon Can."
The [tenth]fourteenth is [a] common [blues] to many blues. The [fourteenth] 18th
and and [fifteenth] nineteenth [are] have been added only lately to make a
longer song and [depend for their interest entirely on the rhyme]
[and exist entirely for the sake of rhythm.] have [no]little interest
for L.B. beyond their rhymes.

Of all L.B.'s repertoire this song is perhaps the finest
combination of [the] simple ballad style, unsophisticated,
folk melody and fitting accompaniment.  [The accompaniment]
[is particularly  The guitar arrangement is]
In the guitar accompaniment accompaniment, particularly, do we discover Lead Belly
the [artist] folk-artist. The guitar rings with the heavy,
thunderous heart-beats of a man who has shot his woman and
knows he will be caught and punished.
