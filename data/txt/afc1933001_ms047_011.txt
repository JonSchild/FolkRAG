Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your very interesting report arrived this morning and I want to tell you
how pleased I was to receive it.  I was just working on a recommendation to
the Librarian when it came.  I am trying to arrange a two month survey and
recording trip through Eastern Kentucky for Alan.  He will have to leave about
September 1 in order to avoid the early snows in the mountains.  The Thomspon
machine seems to be on its last legs and hardly worth repairing anymore, so I
think he had better use the Presto equipped with a converter and batteries.  Do
you think that you could get the machine back to us soon so that we can put
everything in order by September?

I shall be glad to take up the matter of your expenditures with the Librarian
but I think that I ought to get Alan's trip out of the way first.  Don't you?
You had better send me a little more formal outline of your expenditures for the
purpose of discussion.

Mrs. Rose Warren Wilson wrote asking for a "contribution" for her work.  I
had to explain that the Library was prevented by law from making contributions
and that if she had any claim, she should present a bill for our consideration.
Will you please tell me what if any arrangements you made with her.  Did you by
any chance ask her to send us a statement?  If you did, she probably misunderstood
the word for instead of a financial statements, she sent us a long description
of her life's work!

Am I to understand that you approve the restriction of three years, with an
option of three more, on Alton Morris' records.  You see, I am trying to systematize
everything in this decision and I should like to have some formal statement
from you in our files before I officially accept his restrictions.

You will probably be pleased to hear that Alan and I have gotten along
splendidly.  The Archive has taken an awful lot of my time but that was not his
fault - its activities have suddenly increased enormously.

Mr. Waters tells me that he sent his introduction to Macmillan several weeks
ago.  Mrs. Seeger showed me some of her work recently and what I saw looks very
good.
