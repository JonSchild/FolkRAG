Dear Kenny,
Attached is a sheet with the information
about the composers and arrangers of the 
Belleville material.  Would you please
incorporate this information in the booklet.
Those two songs called anonymous are
definitely of Belleville origin and should
be credited to the chorus.  In their letter
they give me additional information about
the choir:  "Under the direction of Thomas
Stevenson."  Rev. Keeling is only Business
Manager.  If this can be changed on the
back cover copy, good.  If not, at least
on the booklet.  Rhoda Parish is the female
soloist.
At this late date the Sacred Harp people
tell me that the meeting was the United
Sacred Harp Musical Association.  I don't
think this was my error, but whether it
was or not, make what corrections you see
fit.  At least I have somebody to make a 
contract with.
I will get to the song notes before the
Philadelphia meeting.
Please return the Belleville composer sheet.
All the best,
Alan Lomax
