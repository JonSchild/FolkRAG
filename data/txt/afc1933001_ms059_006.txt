Dear Mr. Lomax:

     We sent a wire to you to Raiford,
Florida which may not have been forwarded.
It was from Jacob Evanson, Department of 
Education, Pittsburgh, Pa. offering one
hundred dollars for a lecture there. He
asked for an answer by telegram so I
wired him and told him that I had sent
it on to you. If you have not received
it and [stel] still interested, I suggest 
that you wire Evanson immediately.

Sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
