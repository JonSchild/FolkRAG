"If MacArthur hasn't got enough men and materials down there to finish the job he has started now, there's going to be hell to pay. A lot of people have gotten the idea that things have been kind of quiet from MacArthur's camp because Roosevelt is trying to put him in the background for political reasons.

"They are either going to double the hospital at Brigham City or build another one the same size in that same area.

(Traveling salesman. Intelligent observer)
