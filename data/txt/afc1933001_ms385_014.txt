with whiskers on; that's a Yale boy; those twelve Negroes were all T Diamond cow
herds. One lives in Dallas; another, the best Negro that ever walked the earth,
is lost. They told me he once fed cattle at Tulsa. I looked through the graveyard 
but could find no trace of him. Here's a flock of beautiful women. There 
isn't a one of them that a man oughtn't to be willing to spend a cow and a
day on. I hung around that pretty little Greek girl like Grant around Richmond.
This next girl caused me to buy a Quackenbos grammar. She belonged to the educated 
class that called a herd of longhorns a 'squad' of cattle. Two of the boys 
fought a duel over this one in Cumberland University. One boy wrote to the girl 
and quoted these words:
' 'Tis. the hour when from the bower
The nightingale's sweet notes are heard;
'Tis the hour when lovers' vows
Sound sweet in each whispered word'.

The other boy didn't like Byron. Anyhow they fought a duel about the girl, and 
she was worth it.

"That long row of old railroad passes dates from the time when members
of the Legislature took 'em away from the boys. Look at the skull of the best
cutting horse that ever circled a cow, and the tooth of another whose equal
never wore hair. One lived thirty-four years, and lightning killed him.
That iron Gila monster is a bootjack. I found that buffalo knife in 1876. See it
its saw blade. These are iron shoes from oxen. The buffalo hunters from Dodge
City once put shoes on oxen and drove old blue, high-wheeled government
wagons. This shoe fell off on the T Diamond when an ox got loose and went 
back into circulation. You don't see coffee-grinders anymore like this old
sister. This box holds first aid for rattlesnake bite, a syringe and a mixture
of iodine and alchohol."

The Senator paused before a beautifully tinted daguerreotype a, hundred
years old: "My father got this picture way back in 1837-Rebecca Bryan who
married Daniel Boone. She was some kin of the family. A Bryan also married a 
sister of Daniel Boone".
