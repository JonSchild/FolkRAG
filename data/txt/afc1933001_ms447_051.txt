SUN GONNA SHINE IN MY DOOR SOME DAY

We once asked Jelly Roll Morton, hot composer and pianist, what instruments
the boys were playing in country towns in Mississippi and Alabama
in 1901 and 1902. "They didn't have nothing," he said, "only a bunch of
guys on the street corners and in those little low-life honky-tonks that would
sing the blues all day, the same thing over and over and in between times,
beat on some old guitar, or blow a harmonica or pull on a windjammer until
they could think of the next verse."
Blind Jesse Harris, now dead, was pulling on his old accordion even
longer ago in the country around Livingston, Alabama. In those days it
might have had two lungs, but when we recorded him it only had one. With
that one lung, nevertheless, Jesse could play more blues than most two-handed
piano combinations--in between times while he was thinking of the 
next verse.

MUSIC--Sun Gonna Shine in My Door Some Day

1 Been in dat jailhouse, expectin' a fine,
Looked through the door, no friend could I find.

Chorus: 
It's no matter, Lord, I know,
Sun gonna shine in my door some day.

2 Standin' 'round here hungry, ain't got a dime,
Look like my friends ought to come see me some time.

3  Me and my buddy, got think and thin,
My buddy got away, but I got in.

4  Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lord,
Used to be your reg'lar, now I've got to be your dog.

THE RISING SUN BLUES

The fact that a few of the hot jazz men who were in the business before
the war have a distant singing acquaintance with this song, indicates that
it is fairly old as blues tunes go. None of them, however, has information
at his fingertips about the mother who ran a "blue-jean" shop, about the
"house they call the Rising Sun," or about the young lady it proved the ruin
of. We have heard it sung only by Southern whites. Rising Sun, as a name 
for a bawdy house, occurs in a number of unprintable songs of English 
origin.

MUSIC--Rising Sun Blues

1 There is a house in New Orleans, they call the Rising Sun,
It's been the ruin of many poor girl, and me, O God, for one.

2  If I had listened what Mamma said, I'd 'a' been at home today,
Being so young and foolish, poor boy, let a rambler lead me astray.

3  Go tell my baby sister never do like I have done,
To shun that house in New Orleans, they call the Rising Sun.
