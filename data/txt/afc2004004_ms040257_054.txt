Poor Tommy is dead and laid in his grave,
Laid in his grave, laid in  his grave,
Poor Tommy is dead and laid in his grave,
A long time ago.

There grew an old apple tree over his head,
Over his head, over his head,
There grew an old apple tree over his head,
A long time ago.

The apples grew ripe and started to fall,
Started to fall, started to fall,
The apples grew ripe and started to fall,
A long time ago.

There came an old woman come picking them up,
Picking them up, picking them up,
There came an old woman come picking them up,
A long time ago.

Poor Tommy got up and he gave her a kick,
Gave her a kick, gave her a kick,
Poor Tommy got up and he gave her a kick,
A long time ago.

Broken-hearted I wandered
At the loss of my beloved,
He's a jollie, jollie soldier
And to battle he must go.

He wrote me a letter
In the month of November,
And told me not to worry
As he was coming home.

Sweet home. Marrow bone.
Treacle scone. Ice cream cone.
Uncle John.

The night was dark, the war was over,
The battlefield was shed with blood,
And there I spied a wounded soldier
Lying dying as he said:
God bless my home, and dear old Scotland,
God bless my wife, and only child
And tell the people I am dying
For I've won the Union Jack:

That's that.
