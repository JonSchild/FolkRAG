Green Corn

Lead Belly always sings this old-fashioned air tenderly and 
joyfully, as [id] if [he were] softly and pleasantly drunk on green corn 
whiskey [right] warm off the mash. [There is a feeling of Spring in the song] A feeling of spring runs through the 
song, the sound of sappy fodder rustling in a June wind;  Maybe the first roasting corn
of the year are steaming on the
stove perfuming the house with
their sweet green smell and each repetition of "green corn" is like a [sprout] small sprout of corn] [a young corn sprout] young corn sprout pushing up through the brown earth.
At any rate, "Green Corn" is an old[song] song to be danced to and one of the first pieces that Lead Belly 
learned to play on the guitar-- an air that probably came down to 
him from his slave ancestors.
