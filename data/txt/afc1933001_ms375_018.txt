on an' Matt' an' our Daddy an' John's daddy was [s]tryin' to find out somepen of

he'd drunk a quart.  He just went to preachin' an' a-talkin' an' goin' right 
on you [know]z know an' Earl Lee turned right around an' took right up that/rocky holler
with Bob, went to Noey Warren's, the man with the meal sack on his back, drunk
as Hell.  He [had] still had that red whiskey in that other clear bottle settin' on the

you good drink of red whiskey." He got that Tennessee Tom down, you know,

I bucked back an' they'd jerk me up, you know, an' I8d walk a few steps an' I'd
stick my heels in the ground an' I'd buck back on 'em.  I called them enemies but 
they'd actually friends [you know,], to me, you see. But still when I get drunk I'd
cuss them out. I'd buck back, you know, till we got to the house without sayin'
a damn word, but [then] atter we got to the house I just cuseed them out completely.
An I said, "God damn 'em, I'll lay-way, an' kill 'em with shot-guns an' everything

me an' all I remember is The'dore comin' an' talkin' this all off with me.
An' then I[w] [?] went to bed an' that was the last of the damn thing.
