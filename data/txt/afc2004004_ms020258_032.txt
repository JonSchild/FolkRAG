BJ   9-25   p. 2

BJ:     Well, it was on the Gulf.  It ninety-one miles a' (from) Cuba.
We leave Key Wes' altogether.  We goin the Tamiami Trail.  We goin
down t' Naples; it was at Naples, almos'.  Leave offa Naples and go right
on into the ferry boat; Belle Mead -- a little place [down] now
[there] they call Belle Mead.  Yes, that's it; it just settin' near
the ferry  boat.
AL:     That's where those, uh, Conkejos live, down there?
BJ:     Thas right.  They got all kinds a' nations a' peoples. . .oh. . .
boy.  And them big, giant, naked people, I call 'em.  Those big --
Ishohos, (?) or sumpin; I don't know what they are, but they talk
funny, some of 'em. . .And on this lil' island I went to, (this friend
says that ??)  there weren't but one colored man there at that time;
he had been there twelve years -- I mean rather than that stayin'
there -- and, uh, there was a colored boy and a colored girl workin'
in this factory.  And they was Vera and Charlie; they was husban'
and wife, y'know?  So we all went down there; there was a crowd that
went; a lot of mens went down, too.  See, they was buildin' this place,
makin' Keksama and Marko meet -- Keksama on one end of the island
and Marko on the other, which the island is not but 'bout six mile
long -- very small place, see?  An', uh, they was makin' it meet,
y'know?  Andso those mens were there; a lot of those men that was
cuttin' out circles.  You know, makin' those streets -- markin' off,
y'know; just makin' the town -- to street it off and clean it up and
make this town meet.  I never got back there to see how much is built,
but it mus' be pretty well; I see in the papers where the lots and
things is be sold there, down there, you can buy 'em anywhere.
AL:     How long did you stay?
BJ:      I was stayin' there around three months.  That year.  And 'nother
thing, I enjoyed bein' there, y'know.  I had never been over the water
to stay.  We had to go over on the ferry.  Wasn' no roads, though,
then.  I don't think there's (roads) down there yet.  An', uh, they
had the train go there once a day -- thas the Seaboard (Allied-Airline-?)
y'know?  It go there once a day, and when the train go, they turn the
bridge so no[body] one can walk there.  The bridge turn up and down in the Gulf.
And so, anyone wanna go over there had to go back and forth on this
ferry.  (BJ says "ferra")  To go across to the mainland, or sumpin'. . .
AL:      I bet you saw some sharks or somthin'.
