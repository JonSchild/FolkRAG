BJ:  Nno, I ain't had, not, not to my knowin', but, I know he
tell me sometime, like I be talkin' 'bout somebody or, you know,
fixin' to give somebody sumpin'.  Jus' speakin' 'bout like I always
gittin' up things.  An' he'd tell me, "Bessie, I don't
want you to take up too much time with So-an'-so, 'cause they
ain't no friend of you."
     An' I know right then that's just, just what it is.  I don't
say nothin'.  Sometime I say, "Well, they ain't. . .I ain't never
do nothin' to them."
     He say, "Well, they ain't no friend to you. . .I'll just tell
ya that."  He always did tell me that.  An 'he tell me that s-s-several
time.  In several places.
     Then I can jus' catch on then.  A lil'
later, I be aroun' 'em an' I  can catch 'eir eyes.  I'm very
much on eyes.  An' ah. . .I can catch eyes.  Boy, I mean I'm rotten
on 'em.  Hum, ha, ha, ha!  An' so. . .An' I catch that.  I know what
it is then.
AL:  How can you tell from eyes, honey?
BJ:  I jus' tell a lot a things about eyes.
AL:  Like?
BJ:  That's right.  Right.
AL:  You wouldn't tell me, I guess, what you mean about catchin'
eyes?  I don't quite understand.
BJ:  Well, jus' catch eyes.
AL:  Is it a secret?
BJ:  Yeah -- No, it ain't secret, jus'. . .
AL:  You just understand by people's. . .
BJ:  Jus' understand by the way they look.  They has a diffrunt look.
They has a different count'nance (countenance) upon
their face.
