Urban Dominated Cotton Area

Shelby County, Tennessee
Shelby County is in the extreme south-western corner of Tennessee
and covers an area of 728 square miles. It is flanked on the west by the
Mississippi River, on the south by the state of Mississippi, and is intersected
by the Looshatchie and Wolf Rivers. Its position, and the importance
of Memphis as a cotton market place it culturally and economically in Mississippi.
The alluvilal soils are as rich as any in the world. Cotton is the
staple crop and Shelby is the best cotton producing county in the State of 
Tennessee and one of the best in the South.

79, 637, and of these 44,597 were Negroes living, for the most part, on
farms and depending upon cotton for their livelihood. Seventy-five per
cent of the Negro farmers raise cotton as their principal money crop, and
23.4 per cent raise cotton and corn, a common crop balance. The remaining
3.3. per cent raise truck, potatoes, or hay in addition to cotton.  The 
strength of the cotton crop tradition is here evident.  The city of Memphis
could readily provide a market for truck and dairy products which these far-
mers do not grow.  One farmer said:  "I can't raise wheat or hay unless every-
one else do or I wouldn't make nothing and people here won't give up cotton
even for a year."

The County is predominantely agricultural in spite of its large
city of Memphis.  In the total Negro population 69.7 per cent engage in
agriculture and 13.3 per cent are in domestic and personal service.  Only 7.1
