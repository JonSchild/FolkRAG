Some days back I went to the Everyman at
Hampstead to see an old French film made in 1931
by Duvivier (That was the first I'd heard of him),
called "Poil de Carotte." I thought it was a masterpiece.
The story was about a boy aged 8, youngest
of 3 children born to a farmer & his wife. He is loving
& lively, but his mother dislikes him, and makes him
work during his holiday, sending him on errands
when he's playing, finding a job for him to do
when he's about to go hunting with his father,
sending him out in the night to feed the chickens,
constantly rebuking him, scolding him &
hitting him. The new maid servant loves him
& befriends him & finally tells the farmer the
truth of what is happening, because the wife
does all this behind his back. The farmer
vows he'll make up for everything. That day he's
elected mayor of the village & invites his son
along to the celebrations. But once there, he's
again too busy to bother with him. So the
boy decides to kill himself. He says goodbye
to his fiancee, his five year old cousin, tells
her of his intentions. But she tells her father,
the mayor's brother, & the farmer arrives back
at the farm in time to cut him down from
the rope. He asks why the boy did it, & he
answers, "I don't love my mother." And the
