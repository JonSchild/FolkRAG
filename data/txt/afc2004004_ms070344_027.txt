over it in green lichened paths.

Caer Castle.  A round tower from
the old days.  A [?] [?] of a 
square tower.  Battlements from the
days of Elizabeth around a close.
But all is so small. Sweet views of 
the river & little green fields &
small patches of woods from the
windows.  You could have taken in
by chunking roles - man enslaved
so long & so cruelly by such small 
& unimpressive means.  Enslaved
or organized?

[?] was a drink in a bar
with Irene playing.  All day
I felt boring & insufficient &
bitterly out of countenance.  No lift
of heart on arrival  in [McCroone?] where
the full moon made strange rounds
in the square - knots of men in
doorways, the children's shouts
echoing in the narrow ways.
