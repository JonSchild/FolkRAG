an he could win fights -- Oh Lawd -- very easy. (chuckles) Jes 
bein fast. He was very fast you know. Nobody never could git the best 
of him. He always won. Oh he was jes wonderful. In every way he was 
jes wonderful. (laughs) An everybody liked Huddie. Jes in a moment. 
Jes a moment like that when trouble would come up. Thass what they'd 
all know. Jes in a minute they'd all say, "That couldn't a been Huddie! 
Somebody must of imposed on him or doin something wrong. Huddie 
never bothers nobody." Thass the way they always -- I mean you know 
jes some few people would say, "Oh thass jist a mean guy." My family 
always thought he was jes a sweet person. They always thought that it 
was somebody botherin him. They knew that was jes his way of livin. 
He jes didn't low nobody to bother him. He jes wouldn't take it thass 
all. One time he didn't do nothin. A white man that he had played with 
from a chile grabbed him. He was drunk or somethin, an wanted to say 
hello to Huddie. Peoples thought they were fightin an they never 
gave him a chance to say anythin. They railroaded him. He served ten 
years that time. Ten years for nothin. Mr. Lomax got statements from 
some of the people in Marshall, an the white people said that he had 
been railroaded. 
I saw Huddie three times -- once when I was six, once at the dance, 
an then that time he come to my house in Shreveport. An no mo. No mo 
till thirty-four. Thass when he came back an looked for me. That's when 
he found me this last time. That's when Mr. Lomax had got him out. 
H e was in the Lous'ana pen. He looked for me everywhere. He looked the 
t own over. He lived right near me. Four bl ocks from me then. Livin with 
this girl. He say he jes thought about my livin down on the next 
street from him an he walked by there one evenin an ast huh did she 
know where I lived. An she tole him. Thass the way he found me. I was 
settin on the porch. I jes had got in from work an he rolled up theah, 
him an his cousin in a car. They said, "Is Martha there?" I said, "Yes."
