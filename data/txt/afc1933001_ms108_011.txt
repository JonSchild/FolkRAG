of land and sea and
mountains and sky
and castles, ruined
and unruined, on
the whole round globe.
Nice is in the midst
of its annual Spring
festival, the city of
250 Hotels being crowded
with visitors. Next
week we go further
down the coast where
today Miss Terrill and
I engaged room and
board for the three of us
for less than I would pay
in the Lubbock Hotel. The
house is on a cliff
overlooking the Mediterranean. 
The water is beautiful and
mountains tower on three
sides, our house standing
on a peninsula. Monte 
Carlo is only 20 miles
away. A day will do us
there. Miss Terrill and 
Bess have agreed to do
my betting. By the time
this reaches you, we'll probably
be in Italy. Send
letters on to 2 Place de
Madaline, c/o Thos. Cook &
Sons. We have no word
as yet from the U. S. Please
write often. To the last I hoped
to get something from you before
the Queen Mary sailed.
I do hope you are all well
and happy. For as long as I 
last, I am, Lovingly,
Father.
