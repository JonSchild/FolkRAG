GOOD OLD COTTON MILL COLIC

Good Old Dust Pneumonia. Good old Cilicosis you get
in the mines. Good old T/B/ you get in the Cement. Good
old boss, he gives you a hamburger while he throws T+Bone
steak out the back door ---- and drinks more whiskey in a 
week than you drink in a month, and better whiskey, too.

This song is a twin sister to the Talking Blues, and
can be done the same way. It's sort of a double outlaw,
step neighbor, or inlaw of some kind. I guess them music
fellers has got a name for it, but I aint.

Here's an old boy that works in a cotton mill. He
tells you how sweet and nice it is and what a brave and manly
thing it is to pour good whiskey into the big shots bedroom
window --- and to rake dollars into his cash register, and
to strain every gut and nerve in your hole, hole, hole body
a doing it.

This sounds best when played on an old warped guitar with
six rusty strings, two of them broke into, in two, and tied back
together, three others that wont sound much 'cause they're too
cussed old, and --- boy you caint spend a dime for a new guitar
string ..... he-ll no, that's buy the little lady a new dress,
or feed the whole family all day long. (Or, on Wall St., it 
would buy the puff, I mean one puff, on a two bit cigar.)

Wind 'er, grind 'er, grab up 'er leg, and spit on the peg,
and let 'er go.
