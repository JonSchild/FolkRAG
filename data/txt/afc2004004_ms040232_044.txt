Dear Alan,

Many thanks for your nice letter.  I'm glad to hear the work
is easing off - that's something.  And you deserve a break.

I hope you had a good Christmas.  I'm sure you had.  I was on 
duty - Just Finlay and I, and you could hardly get into the office
with empties next day.  We had lots of visitors complete with 
bottles and had one or two good ceilidhs.  Katie Ann was here
and you know what that means.  The Big White Chief was off. 
We tried to 'phone you one day in the middle of a Ceilidh but 
we were told you were not at Rothwell.

Yes, I was very pleased with the programme and I heard very good
 reports on it from people who didn't know I had anything to do
 with it.  I was thrilled listening to it and it brought back
 many happy memories...  I even laughed at "Henceforth and onward". 
I enclose a cutting from the "Stornoway Gazette" which will 
interest you.  No, it's not written by Kitty MacLeod!  I don't
know what he's trying to get at and, obviously, he doesn't know 
what you were trying to get at.  Don't worry; try to get a repeat of it!

And by the way, I didn't like the ending - it sounded artificial
with all the applause.  (You know, of course, that you weren't
supposed to use that Ceilidh any way!)  I met Miss Adair one day
and she thought the programme was TERRIBLE.  Sour grapes, no doubt.

Well, Alan, I'm off to Skye tomorrow to get into trim for Hogmanay 
and the New Year.  I wish you were there.  I'll be there for a 
week - won't be back in the office until the 7th Jan. 
I wrote Dr. Allan and told him to send the receipt and I'll 'phone
him again today.

When is this secret programme going to disturb the Scottish air?
 I haven't told anyone about it.  When is Scotland going to be
 told officially????

It's sweet of you to suggest that I go further afield, Alan.  I've 
thought of it but at the moment I'm in the throes of a wonderful 
romance and couldn't think of leaving Scotland!  That's a secret 
for you!!  Needless to say, he's very sweet.  I'm sure you'll 
be interested - .....

I'd love to hear from you from time to time.  Do keep me posted. 
Remember you have one friend in Scotland, always.  The very best of
luck in your travels, Alan.

Love 
Mary.

P.S. When Hugh Macphee went to London on the 13th Dec. I gave him
 your book for your autograph but he came back without seeing you. 
 I was most disappointed.  Did you see him first??  Remember, you
 must come to Glasgow again some time and autograph it for me. 
 Won't you?
