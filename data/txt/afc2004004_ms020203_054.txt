she went on in the kitchen--our kitchen set off [there] from
the house--a little old log place where de ground was the de floor.
So she went on and made a fire in de stove and cook the bread.
So she say, we won churn, we'll just skim back de cream and
get the clabber outa here and eat it. So, well, she went
out there in the smokehouse. We had a smokehouse out there,
say, "Wait and I'll get us some syrup, that'll be good wid de
milk." I say, "Yeah." So she took a cup and she goin out there and turn the stopper
and get some syrup, well, she did. I 'on sit on the whole churn
of milk up on the table--it was sittin down there on the flo by
the stove--sit up on the table so I could get the cream and
the whole thing slipped outa my hand and busted all to pieces.
And so my sister, my oldest sister, she come runnin, want
to know what-- Oo, we all cried, cried-- And my other sister
come back, "Lord, mama gonna kill us. Um!"
But she did whip me. That's the truth! She come home
and they told her, I told her too, I said, "Mama, I went to
pick it up off the flo and it slipped out of my hands and just
busted all to pieces, just all I know." But she wanted to
know what I'm doing trying to pick it up. What I'm doing with it.
Told her we were hongry. Bessie would not cook. She was talkin
to that old boy, James, and she wouldn cook. Old James Thurman,
I never will forget his name. And she whipped her, too, she whipped
all three of us.

A: What did she whip you with?
