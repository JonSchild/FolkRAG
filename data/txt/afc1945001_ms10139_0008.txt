1- One of the stories that impressed me most was:
Four Marines were playing a game of
bridge at Guadalcanal - a Marine came
rushing in the tent and yelled, "The
Japs are comin." One of the Marines
playing bridge, ---------- casually
said, "I'll go, I'm dummy this play!"
 2- Another impressive story was:
 Hitler was making a round of one of
the insane asylums ^(in Berlin) and as he entered
all the patients there heiled him. There
was one man (a guard) who did not
heil Hitler. So Hitler asked why he
didn't. The man replied, "I'm not crazy."
3. There was a rumor going around in Germany
that the people in the U.S.A. were starving. They
were saying, "What's cookin.'"
