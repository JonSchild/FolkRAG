Ellers, cont.   R-79 cont.   3
AL:  Well, anyway, there's lots of Ellers up around here. . . 
this is the Eller settlement up along here, isn't it?  Your
family's been living here many a year, haven' they?  It used
to be very different in the days you were growing up, didn't it?
Eller:  Like I said, if some of 'em had learned the banjo lik e
I did when they were coming up, they wouldn't learn it so fast.
AL:  Why, what was your trouble in those days?
Eller:  Well, I didn't have no music lessons or nothing, all
I knowed was this "random",  just listening - yeah, that's what
the call it.  You never heard it called that?
AL:  No, I didn't, I love it.  Random, that's the best.
Well, play us another random one.  What about. . . .what one about
the shoes that you played. . . .
Eller:  We'll try.  "Little Red Shoes."  It's hard, we'll try
