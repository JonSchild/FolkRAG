889 Nimrod Workman (cont.) 7
AL: I always thought that Part of the reason the Pentecostals
came in was the Baptists got kind of classified, they
wouldn't let people shout so much, they took the good humor
out and the feeling out of religion.
Nimrod: Yeah, they did. Holiness people would come around
and they got to getting up and saying, we don't want that
here, making noise like a goose, going quack quack. We
don't want that in this church. And the Holiness people,
you know, would get up and leave. They get up and leave out.
Because they didn't believe in that dried up religion, they
believed that when the spirit got on, and they felt the
spirit of the lord, that they would move and they would
shout, and they did. And the Baptists wouldn't have that,
they wouldn't have that in there at all. No, way back then,
they'd run them out. . . .no, no music, [either] in it. But now,
there's music in heaven, huh? Yes sir, there was music in
heaven. They hung them music things upon the willows. . .yeah,
harp. David played on the harp for them. They had music in
Heaven. . . .So these people began to see the light of the Bible,
what it meant, Holiness.  And that's where it come in, Pentecostal. 
They call themselves, "free" because they meant to
free themselves from this Baptist church, instead of being
tied down, you know. They wouldn't let them shout. A woman
had to sit still. Nobody said nothing but the preacher, and
they'd say if you want to know anything, ask your husband at
home, or some of them said, what if her husband is a drunkard,
and she goes home and asks him something, what would he tell her
