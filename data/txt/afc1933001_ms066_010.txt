You about Your three Folk Songs - 
I am eager to do the right thing - 
If You feel I should pay You for the 
use of the Folk Songs in my Symphony
that I will do - out of my own pocket - 
and willingly - only I do hope it 
will not be too much - 
In any case I shall of course give
the customary acknowledgement of the 
Sources of my materials.
Hoping to see You when You come 
East again
I remain
Sincerely Roy Harris
