Not only did the cowboy make up songs about his pony, but he came to
love his favorite horse almost as much as one of his companions. He
talked to it as he rode on night herd or stayed with no other companion
except his pony, night after night, in some lonely line camp.
If the horse was not watchful, a step into a prairie-dog hole might
cost its riders life: or if it was not quick and sure-footed, its
failure to dodge the charge of a maddened steer might bring disaster.
So the cowboy sang about his pony, giving it characteristic names.
On one big ranch in Stonewall County, Texas, I found a number of
interesting and amusing names for the horses.
One that pitched very high was called "Airplane," another, subject
to sudden violent movements, "Dynamite."
A stupid horse was named "Absent-minded," a quick-moving, efficient
Spanish pony, "Big Enough," A swift-running horse answered to the name
of "Cannon-ball," one untrustworthy in disposition, "Snake."
A blaze-faced horse was called "Towel-face," one not cleanly in his
habits, "Polecat."
Still others, whose names betrayed usually some characteristics were:
"Bead-eye," "Red Hell," "Tar Baby," "Sail Away Brown," "Straight-edge,"
"Scissors," "Louse Cage," "Tater Slip," "Puddin'-foot."
On this ranch there were twenty cowboys. To each was assigned eight
horses, called his "string." Naming one hundred and sixty horses was a 
big job, for they all had names. And each man knew the names of the 
entire bunch. But men and horses lived close together, and I fancy the
horses knew the different characteristics of the men, even as the men
knew the horses and their names.
Before I left the ranch, "Slim" Critchlow sang me a song which he said
was founded on fact about a horse known as:
