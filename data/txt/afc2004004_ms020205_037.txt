tend the farm, whilst the chi dren, you know, went to school, ad that
helped me some[what] because when the[y get back, why,] white children would come back from school
I'd get with um and I'd read their books,
you know.  [Well, I studied] And I learned some that way, but the white folks were very
careful about that; they didn't want us to learn too much, because they
said an educated man wouldn't make a good slave, [ad] and that's true.
Well, after we got our farm -d- paid for [it]-- well, then, we worked hard
until we got things fixed pretty well [fixed] on our farm.  We had a molasses mill and
then we had a cotton gin, [and] we ginned the cotton.  We had what they
call a grist mill [and] we [grind] ground the corn on our farm, and my father
lived well as long as all of the children, you know, stayed at home; he
lived pretty well then, and -- but, we all had to work -- no time to
go to school.  In fact, there wasn't no schools anywhere around in the
state of Louisiana for colored.
Where was that exactly?  Near what town was that?
It was in Webster Parish.  [Millin] Menden was the county seat.
Yes, sir, and now I worked on the farm  with my father until I was
twenty-one.  When I was seventeen years old, up until I was seventeen
rather, the fellows around lots of um drank [lots of] whiskey, and they gave me
whiskey to drink, and they carried me out when I was seventeen years
old and made me drunk, and I cut up something awful that day [I went]  There was a white woman come Black Bayou
[across to Mrs. Lee] -- she owned a store [up there] village there, you know, a big gin, a
[great big] a cotton gin, and she was well-to-do.  And by me being a smart
boy and I worked for her a deal, she thought of me as much as she did of
her own son nearly, and Mrs. Lee would always speak up for me you know. P
Probably I would have been maybe killed, had it not been for she.
How was that, you might have been killed?
