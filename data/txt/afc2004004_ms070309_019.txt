moanin' at her washin -
My mother used to sing -
"Father I stretch my hand to thee,
No other help I know."
one old doctor Watt's himes.
We just made tunes of our own. We'd
get a tune that would be familiar
with the song & sing it. You'd
get it to high or low, it would 
go.
The best singer I ever heard was
[Fra] Phranna Smith, traveling
gospel singer - she was singin'
with the spirit of God in her heart - 
singing to just make a noise don't
do no good -
The Lawd Will Make a Way out
o' No Way -
Had a medium voice - so clear - not
pretty - Folks wd get happy & shout
when she'd sing - I'd feel the
Love of God in my heart
â€” new generated & born of God
you blong to the church, don't you?
