The Bold Thrasher -Walter Gale 

1) It's of a noble man in the village of late, 
He had a bold thrasher, his family was great, 
He'd wife and seven children and most of them being small, 
And he'd nothing but his labour to maintain them all.

Polly Vaughan: Harry Cox 

1) So come al you bold sportsmen that carry a gun, 
I will have to go home by the light of the sun, 
For young Jimmy was a-fowling, a-fowling alone, 
When he shot his own true love in the room of a swan. 

2) So the first he went to her and found it was she, 
He was shaking and trembling, his eyes scarce could see, 
So now you are dead, love, and your sorrows are o'er, 
Fare thee well, my dear Polly, I shall see you no more. 

3) Then home went young Jimmy with his dog and his gun, 
Crying, "Uncle, dear Uncle, have you heard what I've done ? 
Cursed by this old gun-smith that made me this gun, 
For I've shot my own true love in the room of a swan. 

4) Then out come bold Uncle with his locks hanging grey, 
Saying, "Jimmy, dear Jimmy, don't you run away. 
Don't you leave your own counteree till the trial comes on, 
For you ne'er shall be hanged for the crime you have done." 

5) Not the trial come on and pretty Polly appeared, 
Saying, "Uncle dear Uncle, let Jimmy go clear. 
For my apron was wrapped round me when you took me for a swan, 
And his poor hesrt lay bleeding for POLly his own.

The Parson and the Clerk - Phil Tanner ; 
1) A parson was preaching to his flock one day on the sins of the human race, 
When the clerk "Amen" aloud did say, with the solemnest old face. 
And the old clerk in a quiet low, would venture a bit of remark, 
"All sin," you said, dear parson, 
"Then sin for me said the clerk. 
Amen - the sin for me said the clerk.
