Mr. Alan Lomax
Hotel Alcazar 
Clarksdale, Mississippi

Dear Alan:

You did not give me any information 
in your letter from Clarksdale with regard to 
the extension which you request. I shall 
be glad to try to get this for you and shall 
make it for two weeks. Mrs. Schwartz is 
not in today, but I shall ask her to estimate 
what the costs will be when she gets 
back on Monday. We are still struggling 
to complete the projects but I think it more 
important for you to finish the job you are 
doing than to break it off in the middle.
 I am quite rushed at the moment and so must 
write you this brief note.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
