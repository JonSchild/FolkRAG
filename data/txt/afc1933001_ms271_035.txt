MODERN CANNON BALL

Far across the great Pacific to the island of Japan,
We've got a score to settle and the time is now at hand;
We've gotta send some airplanes flyin' o'er the sea
To make this country safe for those who love democracy.

Chorus: The aeroplanes are hummin', hear the angry bullets whine,
We're gonna have to use them to change old Tojo's mind;
He'll know his days are over when the shells around him fall,
We'll send this message to him on the Modern Cannon Ball.

I know you've heard the story of Pearl Harbor and Luzon, 
The spirit of the men who died - say, we must carry on;
We'll blast their fleet of battleships from the ocean mighty soon,
We'll blow this up so doggone high, they'll sail around the moon.

We'll drive them from the ocean and the islands of the sea,
The people will be free again just like they ought to be.
Our Chinese friends and allies will see freedom in their land
When we drive those fascists from the island of Japan.
