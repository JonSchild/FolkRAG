L. A. Johnny, Reb Morton, of Spikes.  Two Negroes from Spikes, could read
but had no ideas.  Johnny played piano, Reb, saxaphone.  Occasionally JR
condesended to play with these cornfed musicians.
Some Day, Sweetheart and The Wolverine already published.
The business started in 1921.  Melrose wrote JR, but Spikes got the letler
that they were willing to pay $300.00 for advance royalties.  Spikes
jumped up and wrote the words, got i/3 of the money.  JR published the tune
as Spikes-Morton & Spikes.  They wanted me to drag them over the fence.
Reb married into a millonarire family( her old man got rich off the growth
of L.A. ) Bob Owens.  Argument over the things that they had done.  JR who
really wrote the tine ( got part of the tune"Trix Ain't Walking No More" from
Kid North, the/race horse man).
1908- The Memphis and St. Louis Blues were floating tunes.

When I got to Chicago in May 1923, W[l]olverine Blues was the big hit.  Melrose
was jus a record store manager( Cottage Grove and [3]63rd).  Ralph Love
who had told Melrose about JR told JR to go out there.  There was a banner
"Wolverine Blues" clear across the street.  Melrose had misnamed it blues.
JR calls it [jazz] a jazz classic.  Glover Compton a piano player had already
distributed the news that was his tune.  Melrose was glad to see JR-
planning to go into the business- had made a couple of attempts" Sugar Babe".
A lot of musicians hanging around- the crowds stopped traffic- .  Melrose made
e[o]nough money off of Wolverine Blues to set himself up in a publishing business.
Melrose can just plunk away in F sharp.  JR told him he must keep
the tempo and then you could hear him clumking his feet claer across the
street.
