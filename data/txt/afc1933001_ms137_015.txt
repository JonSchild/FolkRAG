Dear Alan:
     Thanks for your letter of Sept. 1 and let me congratulate 
you on your fine production so far. My previous letter covered
the question of finances and the sooner I get your answer,
the sooner will you receive your money.
     We should have no trouble in arranging for the duplication
of records for Dr. Walton. While on the subject of 
records, do you want the records purchased from Soundscriptions
or Radioscriptions? Please let me know immediately as our
stock is exhausted.
     I recommend the payment of $15 to Greene.
     I am glad to hear that the machine is working well.
Be careful to mark those records made at 3311/3 R.P.M. It is
impossible to insure the machine (we investigated the question)
as it seems to be illegal to insure government property. So
sleep with it from now on.

     Good luck!

          Sincerely,


               Harold Spivacke
               Chief, Division of Music
