Office of the Librarian

October 31, 1941


My dear John Lomax:
           I am deeply touched by your fine
letter. I am indeed glad that I had such
a fitting opportunity as the one you gave
me to make a public statement of my feeling
concerning the work you and Alan have done
in the field of American Folk Song. 
          Please come to see me the next time
you are in Washington. 
                               Faithfully yours, 

                               Archibald Macleish
                               The Librarian of Congress
