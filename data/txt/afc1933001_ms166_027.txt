Mr. Alan Lomax

New York City, N.Y.

Dear Sir:-

I am enclosing herewith a
clipping from the French newspaper "La Presse"
on your recent visit to Montreal for the 
American School of The Air presentation.

I hope you will like the
article about Mr. McGill and yourself, and I
trust your brief stay in Montreal, last week, was
a pleasant one. So here's hoping we may see 
you again this side of the border, in the
near future.

Yours sincerely, 
Paul Gelinas
