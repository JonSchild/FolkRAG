COME ON FRIENDS AND LET'S GO DOWN 

Chorus: 
Come on friends and let's go down, 
Let's go down, let's go down, 
Come on friends and let's go down 
Down on the picket line. 

As I went down on the picket line, 
To keep them scabs out of the mine, 
Who's a-going to win this strike, 
Come on and we'll show you the way.   Cho: 

Went out one morning before daylight, 
And I was sure we'd have a fight, 
But the capitalist scurvy had run away 
But we went back the very next day.    Cho: 

We all went out on the railroad track 
To meet them scabs and turn them back, 
We won the strike I'm glad to say, 
Come on, and we'll show you the way.
