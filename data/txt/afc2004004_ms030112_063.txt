LARRY:
And he was down South at this time.

MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, in his hometown, I didn't really know him then,
he told me about it.

LARRY:
Yes, Mrs. Davis when you and him got married after you all
got married, you all come up here to New York.

MRS. DAVIS:
I came first myself.

LARRY:
He was still down South?

MRS. Davis :
He didn't stay but two weeks when I gone, and he came up,
travelled the ------ and I had to meet him at the train
station. This was the time I had two daughters with him that
was the reason I come to New York you see. I had two daughters
here in New York City. Ruby and Annie.

LARRY:
You and Brother Davis never did have any children.

MRS. DAVIS.
No we didn't.
