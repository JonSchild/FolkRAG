Ballad of a Lumberjack

Midwest Labor

We hailed him as a fellow Jack
He smiled and shook our hand
He said, "I'm with you, back to back
United we must stand.
We all must fight...it's sink or swim."
Thus spoke this gifted gent
Us timber workers fell for him
And made him President.

It was not long and we could see
Our choice was sure a "darb"
This fellow Jack turned out to be
A wolf in shepherd's garb
He spurned our faith, he spent our dough
He chiseled all about
But instead of branding him "B.O."
We only kicked him out.

To err is human, flesh is weak
Thus reads the Good Old Book,
But to deceive your fellow men
Is worse than other crook.
Contempt and scorn, a double crown
He earned from all of us
We hail him in each lumber town
Knight of the Double Cross.

To purge our ranks of all so weak
Shall be our constant aim
We'll know them by their yellow streak
They will not play the game
They'll plead your cause to suit their need
They'll knife you from the rear
They all belong to the Traitor's Creed...
Like Mr. Fred Lequier.
