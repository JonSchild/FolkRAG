Mr. Robert H. Knapp
Massachusetts Committee on
Public Safety
18 Tremont Street
Boston, Massachusetts

Dear Mr. Knapp:

There seems to be some trouble about having the
Federal Communications Commission supply you with copies
of their foreign broadcast monitoring reports. May I suggest 
as an alternative that you continue to supply us with
rumors that you have collected. We can arrange for these
to be analyzed by the Enemy Sources Unit of our Bureau, and
a release prepared in accordance with what seems to be the
best thinking on each occasion. You may be sure that the
role of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety in
collecting the rumors will not be, over-looked.

Our own rumor study has been extended for a second
week so that the full period covered runs from August 3rd
through August 15th. If you could supply us with the material
collected in the Massachusetts region by the 18th or
19th, it would be possible for us to include it in our
analysis. It would be of particular value to us to be able
to compare the rumors you have been collecting in the Massachusetts 
area with those which v1ll be reported to us by
our other resources,

Very truly yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
