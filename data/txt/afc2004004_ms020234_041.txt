peoples so good, but they were friendly.  An' ah, this [one ol']
woman was -- This woman what, what, [what,] ah, her name was, was
Luella.  An' so, she's very friendly.   But I didn't know who all
was in [?] they house.   The house was fullin' out with diffrunt
kind of [junks] drunks, ya know?   But wouldn't be fightin' or nothin', jus',
[jus'] you know, they way of doin'.   [An' so I sayed]
          An' so I stayed next door.  I had the, ah, my boy.  So anyhow,
I was out there washin' one day.  An' this Baby George, he's kinda
like myself; he's very techy, but this thing really got me so bad.
I was washin'.  An' Baby George's over at that house playin'.   Next
house, playin' in the back yard.  An' he was playin' out there.
So I often tell him ta, ah, come back home an don't go there
'cause I figured some of [these] them drunk folks may pick at 'im, but
they never did;  they didn't bother him.   They played with 'im, 
you know.   'Cause sometimes with drunks, you know, I don't really worry,
worry wit 'em about (?).   Still he didn't play for a while (?).
But this day he's [out] over there playin', wasn't nobody around over
there in the, in the front.   Didn't seem to be nobody home.   Well,
it wasn't; nobody...[An so]
           An' so, he...Ah, after a while he come to me, he said, "Mama?"
He said, "You got anything to eat?"
           I said, Yeah," I said, "Go in the house an' git [you sumpin'] yourself..."
I said, "I ain't cooked nothin', but go in an git you-your food
there."
           He said, "That man over there wan-wants sumpin' to eat."
           I said, " I ain't studyin' them peoples, drunk."   That what I
told him; I said, " I ain't studyin' them peoples."
           He said, [Well," he] ah, he said,  "Mama?"  said, "He hongry.   He wanna
eat."
