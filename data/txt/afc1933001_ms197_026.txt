this seems too high, we might establish a rate of $150 for one
hour's actual recording time. This would be in addition to the
costs of making the tapes. If this proposal is approved I
recommend that the money be placed in the Recording Laboratory's
revolving fund but that it be set aside and specially encumbered
to enable us eventually to build up a fund which could be used in
the issuing of further pressings.

Respectfully,

[*I concur and recommend that the
Recording Laboratory be authorized to
collect a fee of $150 per hour's recording
time (or a proportionate charge for less than 
one hour) [beyond the] in addition to the
regular charges for making tape, when the
request comes from a commercial
recording company [and the] for the purpose
of issuing a commercial record.

[*I agree that we need some way
of increasing the poetry revolving fund but
the idea of charging for the use of any
of our collections is abhorrent to me.
It sets a bad precedent both for
ourselves and other libraries.
