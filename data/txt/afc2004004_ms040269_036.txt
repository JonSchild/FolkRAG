LEEZIE LINDSAY, 1959

(To the tune "Leezie Lindsay")

"Will ye gang to the Hielans, Stane o
      Destiny?
Will ye gang to the Hielans wi me?
Will ye gang to the Hielans, Stane o Destiny,
Scotland's pride and her darling to be?"

"To gang to the Hielans wi ye Sir,
I dinna ken hoo that may be
For I'm here neath a chair in Westminster
And keeit wi lock and wi key."

"O Stane, it is little that ye ken
O what a guid Scotsman can dae,
For I'm here wi a watch, and a lever,
And a lass in a Ford waits on me."

He's lowsit the Stane frae her prison,
He;s trundl't her oot on the lea,
And she's aff and awa to the Hielans,
Oor pride and oor darling to be.

FOR KIN AND COUNTRY

Hark the Glasgow Herald sings
English people all have wings,
All the bad ones are the Scotch
Who take the Stone and leave the watch,
How they raise the hue and cry
All the Bobbies running by;
And the Dean, the plot to probe
Takes Cooks ticket round the Globe
Hark the Herald's leaders sing:
"Wae's me for the Dean and King".
