                                                To Governor Maw

Excellency:

We want to thank you most cordially for your kindly assistance in getting the Statehouse 
boys to thinking about military service. (You did help, didn't you?)

Immediately after our last letter to you on that subject, several inquiries were reported 
to have been made by State employees at army and navy recruiting stations. The outlook 
is now more hopeful. Your help worked wonders. The Searchlight is willing to give you all 
the credit.

In the meantime we can supply you with a list of several other live prospects for military 
service if you want to work on them. They shouldn't be permitted to use the Capitol 
building for a hideout.

Another check of the public records at the Statehouse discloses that Wild Willie O'Connor 
is still without a valid driver's license. We wonder if he's traveling on a RECOMMEND! 
He continues to ignore official requests that he turn in his revoked license.

We sympathize with you, Excellency, in your dilemma about Wild Willie's playboy tactics. 
If Pete Dow can't help you out, why not prevail on Gus to intervene? You know Gus has an 
irresistible yen for State service and will respond to any request you make. And don't forget 
that Gus is a good friend of Willie's—serves him with the same fidelity he serves you. 
You can't go wrong on this, Excellency.

Here is a suggestion we know you'll welcome, because you have an earnest desire to 
save money for the State—you've said so. You can save the State $333 a month by inviting 
Mr. Grover to get off Mr. Jugler's seat. You know, Excellency, the Supreme Court said the 
seat belonged to Mr. Jugler. You'll agree there's no use in paying two men to do one man's 
job. And Wendell prefers to milk cows anyhow.
 
It would have been very forehanded of you to have sent one of those "Kiss of Death" 
letters to Wendell. Undoubtedly it would have helped him get one of those luscious Federal 
jobs. The letters seem to have done much for those fortunate boys whom you recommended 
so highly.

Please give our kindest wishes to Cousin Agnes.
                                                                                                     THE EDITOR


                                               
                  Disaster Looms,—                         
             (Continued from, page 4)           
                                                
eat as he looks in vain for even a small morsel, 
of consolation! The paid anti-union scribe 
who covered himself with outward trappings         
of bona fide unionism that he might more effectively 
betray workingmen into the hands of   
as grasping a crew as ever disgraced the State  
of Utah! And what of the filthy money he        
earned? Can he actually enjoy it?               

And what of Dan Jackling, the man Utahans   
looked upon as a hero twenty years ago? Once    
again he stands charged by the Government      
with acts and policies in plain violation of   
United States law. Does Jackling love money    


so much that lie even breaks the law to oppress 
his workmen? Doug Moffat, of course, is 
merely the hired man of Dan Jackling. He carries 
out his master's orders and policies as 
do other Copper executives, including. Chilly 
Charlie, Copper's brilliant counsel.

And we wonder what are the reflections of 
Joseph F. Merrill, churchman, who stooped to 
assist Jackling with "Dear Brother" letters 
to members of his flock to betray them into 
the hands of the Copper barons. And the 
Deseret News, a purported religious paper, 
 that has consistently stood guard as a journalistic 
protector of Copper's vicious methods. 
 When will it advance another lame excuse for 
 Copper's misdeeds, or attack the National Labor 
Relations Board by way of reprisal?
