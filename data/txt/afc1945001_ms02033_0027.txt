RUMORS HEARD -- AUGUST 3 - 8, 1942 - NEW ENGLAND

The method used in collecting rumors for this period of one week was
three-fold:
1. Rumors heard by the writer. 
2. Rumors heard and reported by friends of the writer. 
3. Rumors reported to the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety from

government which might not be actually considered rumors but they are statements
which are in current circulation, particularly among certain groups or racial
elements of the community in which they are heard.

which is quite pronounced in the Boston area and in other sections of New England.
This is a story told about a Jewish manufacturer who was put out of Business
because of priorities. He is pictured as telling his friends gleefully that
