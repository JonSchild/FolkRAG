good initial sale, and in my judgment
will sell steadily through many
years. This is not advice, but only
my opinion. Your self-interest
is to be the only guide for each of
you.

I'd like to know
1. Why Stith Thompson never replied
to my letter about the Yale meeting
and also what were the real forces
behind what happened there and why.

2. How the Folk Lore lady from
North Carolina got on with her
Washington Folk Lore Festival.

3. What you hear from [?]
about Cowboy Songs. I do
not understand the delay.

It would be futile for me to 
write letters from here to
Connally and Sheppard. Besides
I don't think Mr. Putnam would
approve. And in this instance
he has certainly the right to
his say.
