BJ:     Jus' lookin' at the peoples.  Peoples travelin' [diffrunt. . .] there from
one end of the worl' to the other.  You jus' see 'em -- who, who
we might see we know.   We know there['s trains there.]was strangers.  That was [a] the
proper spot.  That was our, our pleasure, goin' down to the Shed
an' seein' the peoples goin' to an' fro.  Sometimes be somebody ya
know.  So.
         Well, we's goin' on down the shed, met this lil' ol' sho't
man.   He, he say, he spoke to us.  An' I spoke. . .we. . ."How ya
all doin!"  [I said]
         [I said] Told 'im, "All right."
         He said, "Y'all. . ."  He says, ah, "How about you all girls,
come on, le's go down [an'] in Miami."
         I says, "All right, le's go to Miami."  [Went on] Kep' right on walkin'.
Didn' look aroun'.   Jus' because I wa'n' studyin' 'im.   Wa'n'
thinkin' about what he was sayin', ya know.   Jus', jus', I figure
it's some ol' flip guy, you know, jus' tryin' to be sayin'
sumpin'.
         So I walked ov' to the depot.   I an' Clara did, an' looked around
there.   An' um, he come on down there a little later on.   An' me an' Clara
was to where you get candy, candy you know, at [the], at the depot.   Buyin'
some peanut canny.   He walked there, he says, ah, he says, "All
right, girls," he says ah, he says, "Where you stay at?"
         I tol' 'im -- Ah, no -- Clara tol' 'im.   So, an' I had said,
I say, "What is that to you?"
         He says, ah, [says] "I wanna know where you stay," say,
"'Cause, sho' nuf, I'm not jokin'.  I want to, let's go to Miami."
So.
         An 'um, I say, "Well, we stay at George Hopkins' (?)"  I know I
