Anecdote
One day William L Shirer, a news
commentator, also author of Berlin Diary, 
was in a grocery store when he over
heard a lady asking the store keeper
for a can of dog food. His reply was
"I'm sorry but we have none in stock,"
because of the government order prohibiting
the canning of dog food. This made
the lady furious, so Shirer came up to 
the lady and said "Look Lady" here in 
America, we've stopped canning dog meat
because we are almost out of tin, but in
Germany they have stopped canning dog - 
meat because they're all out of dogs.
