of the amount is due you.
You will recall that I have already
advanced Mrs. Seeger
$325.00 of her anticipated royalties.
I'll continue to carry
this payment as a private
transaction between Mrs Seeger
and myself. This arrangement,
then, leaves you and
me to stand financially as
follows:
Your note in my favor dated May 1, 1937, 6% interest $39.00
Car 250
Balance of note for $150.00 + 6% int. 84
393-
Less advance on This Singing Country 166.67
Balance due me $226.33
In case of my death you
