back to their house &
throw a rope over the
house.  The oldest man of
the party put the bgm on one
side & the hr on the
other - pulling in the rope 
as a tug of war over the house
Somebody wd give the bride a
hand on the other side.
Both straining & neither won
Then the old man wd leave
the bg mud to the bride's 
side of the rope & make
them both pull on the rope
& then the old man wd give
them a homily on how
they shd both pull together
& everything wd go smoothly - 
Hasn't happened for 30 or 40
