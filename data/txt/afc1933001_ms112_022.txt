Dear Alan, 

Do you know any simple descriptive pamphlet or any reprints 
of articles on South American music that can be got hold of anywhere? Or
do you know of anybody I could write to who might know? We have letters 
coming into our office constantly from people who say they're going to 
address the Witumka Women's Sewing Circle on South American music and want
[dome] some elementary stuff to talk about. I know that their libraries don't 
have a cock-eyed thing in them and it's just wasting paper to send out
detailed bibliographies, and it makes me feel bad not to have anything for
them. I wrote Charley and asked if the Pan-American Union had anything, and 
he wrote back about the Chase Bibliography which we already have and which
has possibly one title in it that's readily available in most small towns
or which book publishers have ever heard of. So I don't quite know what to 
do, and Spraddlegg's stumped too. I get so mad at the complete disregard of 
the ordinary unscholarly public that's manifested by government organizations
and places like CBS, and damned if I don't want to set up a bureau of people's
information where a staff will either send out references of books that are
generally available, or will see that pamphlets which are informative and cheap are issued on popular subjects.
I admit I spend most of my time answering 
mail, but it makes me sore to see all these nasty little printed cards going
out from CBS saying no information available, or we cannot send you the
scripts due to copyright regulations or thankyou for your kind letter of
