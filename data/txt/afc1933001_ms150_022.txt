Dear Alan -
We are enjoying your broadcasts 
tremendously. Last week we turned
 out the whole school (upper dept.) to hear 
you Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 on KRLD.
How is your politics now that 
Hitler and Stalin have teamed up?
Its surprising how well the 
folk songs come through. Watch 
out, Crosby and Vallee, -- a new 
crooner on the horizon?
Best of luck, Alan -- look me up 
when you visit Dallas, Yours
John D. Kirby
