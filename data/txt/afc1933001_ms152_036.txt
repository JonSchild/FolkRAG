Falls Church, Virginia

Dear Miss Morrison:

Thank you for your interesting
song. I believe that it is what
might be called a barroom or college
student folk-song. It will be filed
in the Library of Congress, and is
you know of more I would like to see
copies of them. In appreciation
of your intelligent response to the
program, I am

Sincerely yours,
