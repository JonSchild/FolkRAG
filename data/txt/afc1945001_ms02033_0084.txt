From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, N.J.
Heard in Springfield Mass Aug 13 1942
Subject:  Submarine Menace

"When I was down in Hartford last month
I met Olga. She was up from her home in Florida
for a visit to her mother.
"She said to me, 'Why don't you come down
to Florida and stay with me for a while?'
"I told her that nothing could induce me to 
go there now, with all that oil on the beaches
and the submarines etc.
"That's perfectly silly", said Olga.
"Then I told her that a friend of Ida's had
come up from some town or other in Florida
and she had said that a disabled German submarine 
had surrendered and been searched and
a bread wrapper from a St. Augustine bakery
had been found in the sub."
"'Oh, it's always either a bread wrapper or
movie ticket stubs in all those yarns', said
Olga.
"And now the Herald Tribune and Time both
come out a month or so later with photographs
of a cache at Jacksonville that proved Olga was
all wrong & Ida's friend knew what she was talking
about."
