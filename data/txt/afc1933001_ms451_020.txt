The Young Man who Could Not Raise Corn

[1] Come all you old Virginia boys
I'll tell you of a young man who could not raise corn
The reason why I cannot tell
For I am sure he was always well.

[4] He went to his neighbor's house
According as you may suppose
As his courtship there came on
Says she "My young man, have you weeded out your corn?"

[5] Oh, yes, kind miss, was his reply
Oh, yes, kind miss, I've done and laid it by
It ain't worth while to strive in vain
For I don't believe I'll raise one grain.

[6] If you cannot raise no bread
I'm sorry you want for to wed
Single I am and single I'll remain
A lazy man I won't maintain.

[3] He went to his cornfield
He peeped in
The careless weeds were up to his chin.

[Close up] She said "I think that a shovel or a plow
Would suit you better than a widder just now.

[O] In July his corn knee-high 
And in September he laid it by
In October there came a great frost
The seed of the young man's corn was lost.

[A.] Now he has gone to see a widder
Now I'm in hopes that he will git her
But I think that a hoe, shovel or plow
Would suit him better than a widow just now.

[B.] Help for the singer that sings this song
Help for the young man that couldn't raise corn
Single this young widow [widder] and single she'll remain
For a lazy man she wont maintain.
