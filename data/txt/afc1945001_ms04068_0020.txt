August 4 - The next comment was especially interesting and indicative
as it came directly from an Omaha friend of the writer who has two brothers
working at the Martin Bomber Plant, and her information was offered entirely
off guard.  She said: "Did you know Ed is married and working here now?  He and
Jim both are at the Bomber Plant at Fort Crook."  I asked her how they liked it
out there, and she replied, "Oh, it's all right I guess, but they are not kept
busy enough.  They say the wasted manpower out there is ridiculous.  Some of them
even resort to sweeping the floor in some departments several times over just to
keep busy and keep on the job, and some even have time to take a nap if they
can get out of sight.  No one knows what's holding up production, but Ed often
remarks at home that the Government should come in and try to find out what's
the matter.  No one seems to know."  [*(13)*]
