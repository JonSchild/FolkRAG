dress tail, you know, follerin aftah huh from one room to anothah,
want huh to take it up an put it in huh arms, want huh to give him
a bottle, or nuss him in some sort of way, you know. . .We need to 
be petted sometimes.  Thass right.  (H e sniffs.  His nose is running,
but he is laughing.)  Some times we is jus went fur as we can go.
We need ouwah lovin.  An you're actin hateful wid us, you understan?
Jus cause you got what we want.  That no way to treat us. . .That's
no way to treat us.  Then when you give it to us, don't give it to
us cause we ast you fur it.  Give it to us cause you wanna give it to
us.  Cause I can't git no joy out of, then, you give it to me
you understan, an then you don't wanna give it.  I might as
well quit, cause it jes tear me all to pieces.  I can tell when
I ain't welcome to anythang, too. . .Lemme tell yo u anothah thang,
too.  Did you know one thang?  If that woman don't want you to have
anythang to do wid huh, she may lay down and git you started, now I
don't keer how rambunctious you is, you'll break off every time.
You'll nevah git a chance to git you no satisfaction, cause she
don't want you to have it.  Might as well git up and go on bout yo
business.  Thass truth.  I tried it, an I know what I'm talkin bout.
     (When do you think is the proper time to make love?)

Thass when it'll shore satisfy me i s when the time fur it.
     (When both people feel like it?)
     When yo both feelins git togethah.  An nature git into
nature, you understand, an come to be combined.  You understand?
You put yo strings in yo shoes, you're sposed to string em up even.
Ain't that right?  Den , if dat shoe string breaks, it's no mo a whole
shoe string, although you tied it.  It's no mo a whole shoe string.
