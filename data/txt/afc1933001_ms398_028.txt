IN KENTUCKY WITH ALAN

At the close of an exhausting and adventurous summer in recording  
the work songs of southern Negros, my assistant and young son, Alan,
begged me to go into the mountains of Kentucky and get the music of the
English ballads brought over here and kept more nearly like the original

was his chief source of income, and just over range and around
a turn lay "Bloody Harlan."
