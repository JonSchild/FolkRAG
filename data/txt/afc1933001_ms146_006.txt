Mr. Alan Lomax
Division of Music
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Lomax:

I have your letter of May 15 in which you express the hope that the 
Library of Congress may be able to make duplicates of the recordings
which Mr. Leland Tyler and I made in Iowa, April 5-6.

We succeeded in making twenty-eight or thirty recordings of hymns as 
they are sung by the Iowa Amish. The Amish group in Iowa is rather progressive
and has adopted a number of tunes and hymns from collections later
than the Ausbund collections used by the so-called Amish Mennonites
and Old Mennonities during the middle and latter half of the nineteenth
century. It is easy to distinguish the older Amish hymn-tunes from
the newer ones adopted from the Mennonite hymnals.

We shall be happy to have you make duplicates of our recordings for
your collection. Our recordings are the property of the Mennonite
Historical Society of Goshen College. Do you think it would be possible
for us to exchange duplicates of some of our recordings for some of
those which Eli Bontrager and Johnnie Each helped you to make in April,
1938.

Mrs. Umble joins me in extending best wishes and kind regards to you
and Mrs. Lomax.

Sincerely tours,
John Umble
