When this poor man came home from sea,
It bein' late in the night,
Inquirin' for his own dear wife,
Was his joy and his heart's delight, boys 'light,
Was his joy and his heart's delight.

Oh, she's just gone to her sister's-o,
Shall I go fetch her in?"
Then he began think, say, "No, my dear, I will go myself,
And ask myself to drink, boys, drink,
And ask myself to drink."

As hewas a-goin' along the road,
He heard such a disemal noise,
And who should it be but his own dear wife
Along with with the Barningham boys, boys, boys,
Along with the Barningham boys.

So this poor man stood thinkin',
His heart was nearly broke;
Then he went back and sent the maid,
While he prepared a rope, boys, rope,
While he prepared a rope.
