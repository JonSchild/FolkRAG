"This rationing business makes me mad every time I
eat a meal. A traveling salesman told me last week that the
government is plowing up all of the sugar beets in Colorado --
I'll tell you I don't believe the people are going to take
much more of this foolishness -- We have more sugar now
than we know what to do with -- and yet a fellow can't
have a decent meal" (Roswell, New Mexico, August 4)  [*30*]
