Our Stamps and Bonds.
Sometime ago a United States Marine was guest
star on Serg. [J]Ginny Simms radio program.  On this program
he had the privilage of speaking over the phone to his
mother and father who lieved in Tenn.  His father was an
Major in the army.  As he spoke over the phone he asked his
mother various questions about his old roadster.  His mother
gave every part of his car except the body and wheels to 
the scrap drive.  To all this he said, "it will kill some 
more Japs."  He also mentioned that the scrap gave him a gun,
The War Bonds gave him the bullets.  Those War Stamps [the]
that school children are buying are going to give our boys
the last bullets that may save their lives and bring our united
victory.   The boys at the front know.
