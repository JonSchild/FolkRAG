IT'S NICE TO BE A FARMER
Tune--It's Nice to Get Up in the Mornin'.
Oh! It's nice to live in the country
Amid the flowers and birds,
And feel the pull of nature,
Enjoy the summer showers.
But when the year is over
And all the bills are paid,
You wish you had an office,
And in the town had stayed.

Oh, it's nice to be a renter,
Without a tax to pay,
And give the landlord plenty,
One-third of all the hay.
But when the landlord settles,
His bills with all the rest,
You both are in the same boat,
And numbered with the lost.

Oh, it's nice to be a farmer,
It looks so easy too,
With all earth's good things calling,
And luxuries, a few.
But when you strike a balance,
And find you're in the red,
You think of every other thing
You'd rather be, instead.

But there is a Farmers Union
To change your tune around,
So lift your eyes to skyward,
Instead upon the ground.
We've got to change the system,
And pay the farmer fair,
Oh, it's nice to belong to a Union,
And make them treat us square.

THE MORE WE GET TOGETHER
Tune--Ach, Mine Lieber Augustine.
The more we get together, together, together,
The more we get together, the happier are we.
For your friends are my friends,
And my friends are your friends,
The more we get together, the happier are we.
