be no more. Where is the 
Big Record Country of Virginia?
and what are your leads 
there? Write or wire me 
at Galax and tell me

stop.  I'm too worn 
out to trek back to Kentucky.
We have sent you 
about 50 records from 
the Livingston section
some priceless stuff
among the mass of 
interesting material
