Then my papa called me
And I answered sir
Then my papa called me
And I answered sir
He said son don't you forget
What you are fighting for
He said son don't you forget
What you are fighting for

Then my sister called me
I answered hey
My sister called me
I answered hey
Brother fight and preserve
The good old American way.

Down in Tennessee
I got a gal that is waiting
Down in Tennessee
I am going to see her
When I come from oversea
And I don't want to see her
Till after victory.

Mr. Hitler must be crazy
He sure can't be blind
To think that he is able
To take this land of mine
To think that he is able
To take this land of mine

Now Mr. Roosevelt don't you get worried
We will be home before long
Mr. Roosevelt don't you get worried
We will be home before long
But don't you look for us
Until you hear that Hitler's gone
But don't you look for us
Until Hitler's gone.
