TAPE: R 83 cont. 6

It was real good. The dogs were all coming tearing up there,
we turned it on, they quit hunting, thought it was another
bunch of dogs. There they come and next morning Louis wanted...
took it to a friend's house, John's house to be exact, and had 
it on wide open, and he was sitting there just like he didn't
see nothing. This colored guy standing over on the corner, he
began to look each way up and down in the other direction, trying
to find that pack of rabbit dogs coming up the road and it was
 a little small tape, so Louis said he never laughed so much in
his life as at that fella twisting and turning trying to find that
bunch of rabbit dogs.

AL: Doodle, what do you all think of Sacred Harp?

Doodle: Well, now, that is a beautiful........

AL: What do you all think of Sacred Harp music anyway, SH singing-
do you all enjoy that?

Man: I do.

AL: Mr. Ingram, what do you think- do you ever go?

Ingram: Yes I enjoy it.......yes, quite often. But I prefer....
I like the seven note(?) singing better than the Sacred Harp-

AL: But you do it, don't you?

Ingram: No sir, I don't.

Doodle: You gotta be a special kind of person to do that Sacred
Harp, that's hard to sing.......well, it's just like I say, it's
the way.....it's noted and all...see that kind of music, I mean
