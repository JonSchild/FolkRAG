CHAPTER XXXVI
AT LAST, the bedroom door
opened, and Bert came out.
Astonishingly, he was smiling.
  "John is going to be all right." he
told the two girls. "Just a shoulder
wound.  The doctor says the shock
was worse than the injury."
  "Oh, thank heaven!" Virginia
breathed.
  "I'm going in to see him," said
Harriet, moving toward the bedroom.
  Virginia watched her go, knowing
that Harriet had the right to
go to him, whereas she, Virginia,
could only sit here and nurse her
remorse.
  She turned to Bert, said miserably,
"Bert ... you were right. I
mean about me and John. I -- I love
him. But it's too late now.  I had my
chance to marry him and passed it
up."
  Bert took a quick step [to]ward
her, "Virginia, tell him so! [???] not 

to see you again. She has changed
quite a bit since San Juan.  I just
thought I'd let you know ..."
  Before John could speak, she was
gone.
  He sat staring dazedly at the door
she had closed behind her.  Could
she mean what she seemed to mean
-- that Virginia had fallen in love
with him? Greatly agitated, he rose
and paced back and forth. Oh, if
it were so, why couldn't it have
happened sooner? Now -- now it was
too late!  There was Harriet. He
couldn't go back on her ...
  IT WAS almost time for Virginia
to leave for the train.  She sat in
her room, surrounded by her
packed bags, and contemplated a
bleak future.  Never had she felt so
heartsick, lonely and depressed.
She supposed that, in time, she
would forget John but, right [???]
the thought of never see???]
again made life seem [???]
