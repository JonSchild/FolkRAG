                                                             The Plantation

The King and Anderson plantation occupies a fifteen mile strip 
of Delta land contiguous to the city of Clarksdale.  The U.S.highway 
runs through its center.  Its sharecroppers are Negroes.  The plantation 
is almost treeless, showing the intensive cotton cultivation. 
The black and fertile soil is beady in texture when dry and is sticky 
when wet.  All this land is under cultivation save the plots left 
for the church, the school, the gin, the commissary and the houses.

In appearance the tenant houses are all alike; they are painted 
green and trimmed in white.  Most of them have two rooms, but there 
are some with only one room.  A typical house is generally bare 
except for the newspaper on the wall, a stove or fireplace, a table, 
and an old bed in the corner. Some of the houses have a separate 
kitchen. In sharp contrast to the tenant houses are those of the 
overseers. They are painted white and are surrounded by trees, lawn, 
and shrubbery. 

The plantation store is located on the U.S. highway. Both in 
appearance and in stock it resembles the old "General Store". It is 
one of the largest buildings on the plantation. 

Located about one hundred yards from the highway is the church. 
Its well built frame structure is painted gray with white trimmed 
borders. Placed on a wooden frame in the front of the church is a 
large bell which is used to bring the people together to inform them 
of deaths in the community as well as other important meetings. The 
interior of the church is kept neat and clean. There are Sunday School
