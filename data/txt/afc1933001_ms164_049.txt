Miss Chotas
The Mexican Embassy
Washington, D. C.

Dear Miss Chotas:

          I think you must be quite the most pleasant
person in the diplomatic service to continue to 
sing so anxiously about my poor records. They will
be safely waiting for you when you and I are a little
less busy. I haven't had the time to think about them
for a moment lately and I haven't been fighting any war
either. 

                                              Sincerely yours,

                                              Alan Lomax
                                              Assistant in Charge
