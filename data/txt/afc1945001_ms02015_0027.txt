MEMORANDUM

To:             R. Keith Kane

From:        Charles Tyroler, II

RE:             Office of Price Administration

            The extensive field staff of the Office of Price Administration 
has splendid potentialities as an instrument for
judging public reactions to price control, rationing, etc.

            O. P. A. has ten regional offices:

                        1. Boston            6. Kansas City
                        2. New York        7. Dallas
                        3. Philadelphia   8. Denver
                        4. Chicago           9. Atlanta
                        5. Cleveland       10. San Francisco

Field inspectors now total over 300 and will soon reach 1000.

            Dr. Harold F. Gosnell, University of Chicago political 
scientist, is engaged in training the field personnel.  He is 
willing to utilize the O. P. A. field staff as part-time interviewers 
for systematic surveys of public opinion.

            Dr. Gosnell has had twenty years of professional experience 
in the field of public opinion polling.  He is willing to 
accept directive policy suggestions from this office. 

            Gosnell has already conducted a sample poll in Dallas, 
and is engaged in developing large-scale plans for this project. 

            But he needs further authorization and encouragement 
from "higher-up" in order to go ahead full blast.
