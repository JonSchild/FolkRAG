[underline] Highlights on Organizing and Operating Rumor Clinics [/underline]

The following points [strikethrough] are designed to [/strikethrough] outline briefly the plan of organization of Rumor Clinics as agreed upon by the Office of Facts and Figures, the Office of Coordinator of Information and the  [strikethrough] U. H. [/strikethrough] Office of Education:

1. Approximately 25 representatives of all sections of the country will be designated during the spring of 1942 to operate official Rumor Clinics.

2. Each Rumor Clinic must be headed by a qualified professor of psychology of sociology selected by the president of the university.

3. The head of the Rumor Clinic shall recruit his unit of approximately 25 or 30 professors and advanced students as follows:

(a) Each participant must sign up for not less than 4 hour per week of volunteer service in the work of the Clinic plus 2 hours for participation in a weekly conference;

(b) Each volunteer should be carefully considered by the head of the Clinic to make certain that he or she has demostrated loyalty to American institutions and has at no time since 1939 advocated appeasement of participated in activities of organizations such as America First. (This in no wise casts reflections on large number of individuals who honestly advocated appeasement or participated in organizations which were regarded as helpful allies in the Nazi campaign of psychological warfare. Recruiting for the Rumor Clinics calls for a high degree of selectivity. It is therefore urged that the persons selected [strikethrough] by [/strikethrough] be individuals who have indicated discriminating understanding of the nature of this war from the beginning.
