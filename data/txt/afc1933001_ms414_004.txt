The Cowboy's Ride, 
Mrs. Minta Morgan 
Bells Tex
Oh! for a ride o'er the prairies free, 
On a fiery, untamed steed, 
Where the curlews fly and the coyotes cry 
And the Western wind goes sweeping by 
For my heart enjoys the speed.

With my left hand light on the bridle rein 
And saddle girth clinched behind, 
With lariat tied at the poney's side 
By my stout right arm that's true and tried 
We race with the whistling wind.

We're up and away in the morning light
As swift as a shooting star
That suddenly flies across the skies
And the wild birds whirl in quick surprise
at the cowboy's gay hurrah.

As free as a bird o'er the rolling sea
We skim the pasture wide,
Like a sea gull strong we hurry along
And the earth resounds with a galloping song
As we sail through the fragrant tide
(over)
