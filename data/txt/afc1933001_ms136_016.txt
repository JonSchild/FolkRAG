Mr. Alan Lomax,
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I had occasion recently to ask
Mr. Benjamin Botkin, Folklore Editor of
F.W.P., some questions concerning the
possibility of getting an Ohio collection of
folk songs into print. He suggested that I
tell you my story, and said you were
now in the Middle West. It filled me
with hope that I might see you somewhere.
If only you knew of my work as
well as I know of yours! But you see
my collection is still in manuscript, so
you couldn't know except by hearsay.
I think I am ready for publication, with
bibliographies up to the minute, and
enlarged daguerreotypes of my old singers
ready for print. It is my intention not to
repeat the already long bibliographies of
other volumes, but to use only the books
of the last decade. I have only just added
Mr. Mellinger E Henry's songs out of his
1938 volume.
My tunes are, I think, the best part
of my collection. At the last White Top
Folk Festival, two years ago, John Powell
