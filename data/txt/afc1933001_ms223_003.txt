or forgo other matters, but these
repeated delays are sure to
hurt and hurt badly. I
take the blame for everything
that falls to my share.

I missed you sadly
Christmas, as you already
know. Bess got up from
three days in bed to head
for the cold in New York.
Naturally we are worried
about her and where and
how she will spend the
rest of the week. Will
you send me word at
once? She is slow to write.
Johnny is still around.  We
are taking lunch with John
Thomason.
Lovingly,
Father
