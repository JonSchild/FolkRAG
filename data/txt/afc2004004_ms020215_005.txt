[*MISTREATMENT OF NEGROES*]

BJ:   (Cont.)  You heard this on the air the other day, where this
man was talkin' to this white man -- this preacher was preachin'
on the air?  And they say this colored man tol' him that he wear

when you, ah ah uh, cussin' an' doggin' after me jus' 'cause my
skin is dark," he said, "Man," he said, "You talkin' to God."
    
Ha, see? An' that was true. He was talkin' direct to Him.
So much I could say.

that way, you know, that we would, that that
that they wouldn't treat them like they treat them.  'Cause they's
jus', jus' diffrunt in it.  An' it's diffrunt in the heart, they
diffrunt in the ah ideas an' doin' an', and ah, charity and love.
