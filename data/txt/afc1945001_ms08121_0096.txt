This item was sent in a letter from my cousin who is
new stationed in the Aleutian Islands.
After many days of sitting up around camp
as late as I possibly could, of standing night
guard, and other such things, I finally decided
that tonight I would really get to bed
early. I did, too, turning in about seven
o’clock. When I awoke, it was dark outside
as usual, but upon looking around I discovered
the rest of the bunks were empty.
What had happened? Had the Japs been here
and gone while I slept? Looking frantically
around for a clock, I finally found one -
it was eight o’clock. How had I missed
reveille?! Dashing outside I tried to locate
the other fellows and finally found one, and
discovered, to my amazement, and to the
rest of the camp’s amusement, that it was
eight o’clock P.M. I had slept one hour!
