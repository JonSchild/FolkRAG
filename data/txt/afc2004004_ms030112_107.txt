MRS. DAVIS:
So we stayed a while, then the man went up in the rent and we all decided we would give it up you know.
LARRY:
Then that other thing happened to him when he went away. Did somebody break in there? In the shop.
MRS. DAVIS:
Oh, yes. They did break in.
LARRY:
Ah, Mrs. Davis, did he ever talk to you, I mean can you think of any, any case that kinda stands out in your mind where you know he used to lose his guitars. He be walking down the street and somebody would just come up and cut and grab it and take it off. Can you think of any, any chase that stood out in your mind?
MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, I know this couple of times he lost his guitar, at least he didn't lose it, but this night somebody just give him this guitar, I believe it was a man that was on Reed, just give him the guitar and he's coming home and somebody cut the string and was taking it from him. Several times his guitar was taking off of his shoulders.
LARRY:
Thats about as low as you can get. You get any lower than that they just cover you up, thats about as low as you can get.
