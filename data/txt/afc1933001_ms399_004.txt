Tex. Jack and Sil. Jack
- 2 -

Hypodermic needle and gritted his teeth as I pumped morphine into three places
in his swollen wrist. Then he rode into the arena. The steer was big and
vicious, but Jack threw him just in front of the judges' stand in which at
that moment sat Teddy Roosevelt, President of the United States. Jack galloped
his horse to the door of the tent where I stood waiting for him and as he
walked towards his bed, he fell flat on the ground, fainting with pain from
his tortured wrist.

Yet that night we had dinner together and afterwards Jack sang for 
me many songs. Among them was the story of Silver Jack, a he-man of the West
and the hero of another ballad sent to me by Stewart Edward White. Strangely
enough this ballad fits either a cow camp or a lumber camp. Years before
Texas Jack sang it for me, a professor of Harvard University had sent me the
words and tune, saying that his father had got it from lumber jacks, in Michigan.
Later Mrs. Hallie Bryon Perry of Edna, Texas, gave me another copy. After all,
there are points of resemblance in a cattle "drive" and a lumber "drive" and the
first line of the song speaks of a drive. Here is what Texas Jack sang to me
as he nursed his wounded wrist:

I was on the drive in eighty
Working under Silver Jack,
Which the same is now in Jackson*
And ain't soon expected back,
And there was a fellow 'mongst us
By the name of Robert Waite,
Kind of cute and smart and tonguey,
Guess he was a graduate.

He could talk on any subject
From the bible down to Hoyle,
And his words flowed out so easy
Just as smooth and slick as oil,
He was what they call a skeptic,
And he loved to sit and weave
Hifalutin' words together
Telling' what he didn't believe.
