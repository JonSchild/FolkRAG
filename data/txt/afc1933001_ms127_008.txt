[FOR MORE CAPT. PEARL NYE CORRESP.,]
[SEE ALSO AFC 1937/002]

Akron, Ohio
Nov. 4, 1937

Dear Dr. Putnam,

I have made a mistake which I want to take 
the responsibility for. Dr. Spivacke had written 
me about coming to Akron to record the songs of 
canal-boat Capt. Nye and I fancied that your consent 
for the trip had already been secured, when, 
indeed, it had not. Now Dr. Spivacke notifies me 
that he has asked for a two weeks extension of my 
trip, which, under the circumstances, I am 
afraid I do not want and should not avail myself 
of. Elizabeth and I are both tired of the field 
and, more than that, Elizabeth is not well and has 
not been well for some time. I feel that I should 
bring her back to Washington and put her under the 
care of a physician I can trust, at once.

I hope that you will appreciate this 
pressing difficulty and that the onus for the 
error, if any, will not fall on Dr. Spivacke.

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
