[*WEST GREEN CONT. (DR BELL)*]

what tried to get me in that house, ya know, for that white man --
well they, ah, said that I was a cunjur (conjurer).   See?  Said I
was a root worker; said I had come there; said Alice knowed I was
comin'; I come there to doctor on Alice.   Well, they was the ones
who messed her up.   You see?  They was the one  who messed her up.
At the time.  Because she was a little bit bugged at 'em.   She
was a goodtime woman an' they didn' like her, ya see.  So.  They
say I was a cunjur.  Said Alice knowed it.  That day when she
got talkin', throwin' them snares [(sneers? she means?)] [*hateful words*] an'  hints
an' things, she was hintin' at that then.  Call me ol' root
workers an' all kinda things.   An' got mens  [an] that nobody don't know
who ya got; ya think nobody don't know". . .All kinda things like
that.  Through it all; I [didn't know what] jus' walk out an' lef'.
Ya see?   An' lef' her there.  I jus' lef' then.
That's what it was then, she was mad right then 'cause what they done didn't do her no
good.  See, we had -- Mr. Bell had done fixed the whole house around
there; nothin that they could put down would do her no harm.
(REFERENCE HERE TO BURYING ILL LUCK CONJUR CHARMS ON THE PROPERTY)
An' so they knowed to stop.   I said to Dr. Bell, myself, that we
hid him.  'Cause after I sent for him, Catherine said, "Don't
let ['er] 'em know he here."  See, 'cause they want to keep 'er there;
she hand't been to a bathroom in two years!   She had to use her
pot an' slide [on] outa her chair [open] over.   An' her laigs an' things was
swollen so that the water was runnin' out of 'em.  But up in here
wasn't swoll a bit; jus' from here on down, the bottom part of
her.  An' I mean she was swoll.  She had to wear old. . .mens shoes.
TL:         What [did they do to her?] what was wrong with her?
BJ:         They had done somethin' to her in childbirth.  [What cou]
Folks can mess ya up in childbirth, ya know.  They'd done sumpin'
to fix her, in childbirth.   An' so she had to give her baby --
the baby was from some other man, somewhere -- anyhow, that was
the baby's peoples that the chile was with, the baby's mother --
grandmother and grandfather.   They knew that that was they son's
chile.   An' so they was Bells.  The las' of their name was Bells.
An' so they -- she told them not to bring the chile 'cause she
couldn't walk or nothin'.   She wanted to see it; you know, she
wanted to, but hit would worry an' so jus' tol' 'em to keep
it out there.  So when she got to where she walked out there that
day,              boy, that was a joyful time.  She walked out there.
