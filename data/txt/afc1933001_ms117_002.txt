Dear Mr. Voris,
I am unable to understand why I have as yet received no reply to
the letter I sent you last month, in which I enclosed a sample
expense account and asked you if you thought it followed all
the rules and met all the qualifications of a proper expense account.

airmail enclosing the vouchers and receipts that I sent you. With
the hope of hearing from you at your very earliest convenience, I
am,

Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax

I get my money back as it is. Thank God for Zora. I suppose she'
