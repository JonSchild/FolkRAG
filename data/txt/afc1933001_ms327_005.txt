son-of-a-gun kind of grows on you," 
said Johnson. And he made notes on 
the backs of old envelopes and unpaid
bills and unanswered letters and 
stuffed them in his pocket. Then he
got a couple of orange crates, one, 
lying down, to sit on, and one, standing 
up, to write on. He began writing,
and when he finished, ten years later,
he had written more words than any 
man had ever written about any other
man before.
   By the time he got through he'd 
found out a few things. he'd found
out that this country, with its institutions,
belongs to the people who inhabit
it. He'd found out that the people
were right and the people were
wrong, but they were righter more 
often than anybody else. And he'd
found out that democracy was right 
and democracy was wrong but it was
righter than anything else. And it 
wasn't a question of maybe, or if, or 
someday. It was now, any old time, 
the sooner the better, let's go.
   Occasionally Johnson sand in a spiritual
that ended, "I ain't got long to 
stay here." But he hasn't found out
what he came to find out.
   He's sixty-three now. He married a 
good woman, whom he calls "the 
missus," and they live on a farm with
their three daughters. Johnson knows
how to milk a cow and how to midwife 
a goat, he knows whether it's going to
rain and what the corn looks like it's 
going to do. He likes a bowl of common
wild flowers on the table. He eats
in his shirt sleeves, and takes off his 
shoes and listens to Charlie McCarthy. 
His health could be better, and his
health could be worse.
   You've seen him, I think. You've 
never noticed him, but I'll lay you a 
bet you've seen him.
   He goes around with his had pulled 
down and his collar turned up, and he
doesn't look like he'd come up to you
and ask you for a dime, but he doesn't
look like a good prospect to ask for a 
dime either. He climbs up on a stool 
in a Greek restaurant and hollers,
"Scup scoffee." He walks down the 
street eating cherries out of a bag and
seeing how far he can spit the stones.
   You've seen him.

Saves His Butts

HE WON'T wear a full-dress suit for 
anybody, and he wears long woolen 
underwear and ear muffs in the winter.
 he smokes nickel stogies and 
puts the butt in a case for next time.
He watches steam shovels an forgets
he has an appointment. He's always
swapping stuff he doesn't want for
others stuff he doesn't want. the other 
day he saw a sign saying Papaya Juice,
and he bought a bottle of papaya 
juice.
   He gets on a train with a bag of 
peanuts and a brown-paper bundle.
Inside the bundle are a couple of
 homemade sandwiches and a seventy-
five cent thermos bottle full of coffee.
When the passengers complain to the 
conductor about the peanuts, and the 
conductor complains to Johnson,

to say. He thought of saying "poet,"
and he thought of saying "bum," but 
he figured the fellow would think he 
was crazy. So finally he had some 
cards printed that said he was President
of the National Pawpaw Growers
Association. Now he gives it to 
the fellows in the smoker. There is no 
National Pawpaw Growers Association.
   Every common man would like to 
invent a National Pawpaw Growers
Association and hand out his card to 
the fellows in the smoker. Johnson 
just goes ahead and does it. He sticks 
his head in side a pie wagon because 
he wants to know what the inside of a 
pie wagon looks like. He goes around
the country, up and down the country,
asking everybody, "Where do you 
come from?" Where are you going?"
"You you think you'll be here forever?"
"Where do you go when you go back 
where you came from?" "What's 

there in it for you?
I didn't get your drift
