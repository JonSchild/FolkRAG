MOSES, MOSES
John Davis's spiritual

REFRAIN:
Moses, Moses, don't get lost
In that red sea,
Trust you rod and come on 'cross,  (REFRAIN)

God told Moses, "Don't get lost (REFRAIN)
"Just trust your rod and come on 'cross (REFRAIN)

Don't be like the one that did get lost (REFRAIN)
Trust your rod and come on across (REFRAIN)

God told Moses, etc.

God talked to Moses about the sea, (REFRAIN)
Said "Moses, Moses, trust in me, (REFRAIN)

Moses called upon his God (REFRAIN)
And God told Moses trust his rod (REFRAIN)

Said, "Moses, Moses, don't get lost, etc.

Then God told Moses, "Don't get lost (REFRAIN)
 "Just 'tend your rod and come on 'cross (REFRAIN)

 Now Don't be like the ones that did get lost (REFRAIN) (2

[ Ol' Pharoh's hopin' they get lost (REFRAIN (2)]
Oh, Pharoah's host, it did get lost (REFRAIN) (4)
[Ol' Pharoh's hopin' that they get lost REFRAIN]

Now, Moses, Moses, don't get lost, etc.
