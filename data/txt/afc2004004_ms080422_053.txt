Tape: 891 cont. Nimrod Workman
AL: You know that's a favorite song of mine...
Nimrod:... And he got going you know, and Mack said
what did he mean. I said, he thought you was a monkey.
I never said a word til that night. But when he got up and
said... (difficult to understand--camera has come on in mid-sentence)
I said listen, I'm not an old fool. [ And 
he said, what did you stay down in that hole for? And I said
cause I had a wife and children. He said, I'd a left 'em.
I said that'd be just like ya. You got all that big roll
of money, you'd left em. I stayed down there to feed them.
[ I said, Listen Mr. Rich man-- he was rich man-- I said, Listen,
I want to tell you something.  If it wasn't for us coal miners
in there holes, us laboring people, people like you wouldn't
have a light to hang over your heads in New York. He said,
come'on woman, let's go, that man is crazy... He had 
money enough-to burn me and West Virginia, both of us]
(after a bit--) AL says: Let's have Lovin' Henry. 
(Phyllis)

Come in, come in, lovin Henry, she says
And stay all night with me.
I'll make your bed as white as snow
and pure as ivory.

I can't come in nor I won't come in
And stay all night with you.
The girl I left in New Orleans
thinks that I've been untrue.

She bent over across the fence
To take a kiss or two.
With her pen knife she held in her hand
And she pierced him through and through.
