Uh, say, "I'll put it.  Jus' let it stay right here, hear?"
ZOOM.  Throwed it right un'neath the bed, BAM.  The axe laid there
'till she come back for it.  Come back for it 'fore day in the
mornin'.  But they thinks nothin'.  They ain't thinkin' nothin' about
it, ya know. 
     Next thing brought was a straight piece a iron.  Jus' straight,
long like a pipe.  Said she wanted to use it, an' to keep it for
her until she come back.  "Jus' let it set jus' like I lef' it,
straight as it could set."  You know, jus', jus', she didn't say
that, but that's the way she said it.  Said, "Let it stay here,
jus' like I leave it. Ain' nobody. . .It ain' gonna fall."  An'
then leave that iron set straight up there on that wall right
b'side the bed, until she come back for it.  Well, those things
in that time, look like I would thought sumpthing.  She stay
right over the hill there.
     An' you know what Pinkey would do?  Pinkey'd git up
in a corner?  An' stan' up, Lawd knows, if I never hope I -- I know
I ain' lyin' -- never.  Jus' stan' like this here, jus' as
straight as she could stand, jus' straight!  Not all day long,
but if you don't pull 'er out or do sumpin'. . .Them, "Don't,
don't bother me."  Don't call me 'Pinkey.'  Call me 'Ollie.' "  An'
that thing liked to killt me, you know?  I look at that chil',
say, "Wh-what did this?"  An' stan' up jus' as straight as this.
Like that iron.
     Get up un'neath that bed an' lay there like a snake.  Right
down.  "Don't call me!  Don't call me!  Call me 'Ollie.'  Call
me 'Ollie!' "  Don't you know?  On an' on.
     An' go out in that yard an' jus' jump up jus' like she
gonna fly.  "Whooo me!  I fly like a bird!:  An' jus' go to
runnin'.
