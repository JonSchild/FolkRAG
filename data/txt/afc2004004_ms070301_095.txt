They marched along so cosily
They reached the iron gate.

The keeper being in the rear to bid
then for to wait.

He began to pull a pistol out,
when the owlets gave a scream

Down he fell ai I'm shamed to
tell how his wife hed him
to clean!

Then the keeper like a man that's
mad - how he did stamp & swear

But the laundry maid did nought
but laugh saying what has brought
you here.

He says I'll let the master know
that you have broke the rule

But the laundry maid did nought
but laughed & called him a fool
