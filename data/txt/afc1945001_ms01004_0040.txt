is seldom loved by his shiftless neighbor, while a hard-drinking, happy-go-lucky 
fellow is. This psychological factor undoubtedly played an important 
part in moulding Brazil's attitude toward war.... 
But after this war the 
German fatherland will no longer have to send her sons and daughters out into 
the world to be exposed to the insults and jealousies and hatreds of those 
who cannot appreciate German qualities. 

Strong Material Motive--"A second motive for Brazil's formal declaration of 
war was purely material...German investments and German property in her land 
proved a bait which Brazil could not resist.

Threat for Future--"I am afraid that Brazil will find Germany will remember 
who were her friends during the war. Let Brazil peddle her coffee and her 
other products to Uncle Sam.  Brazil coffee after the war will be too bitter 
for the German nation.

No Gain for Allies--"Brazil, it is claimed, will contribute valuable aid to 
the allied cause.  In fact, however, Brazil's entry into the war will not influence 
the strategic or economic balance in the least. The military gain 
will have little importance. Regarding shipping, it was already in the service 
of the allies.... So what?

The U-boat Weapon--"It is a long road from the plantation and mines of Brazil 
to the mills and factories of the U.S.  And German U-boats can now proceed to 
make the coastal waters of Brazil and the high seas as unsafe for Brazilian 
shipping as it has for her other enemies."
