they should be classified carefully according to their content. The
first natural division is into local and non-local types. Local rumors
are obviously those which allege unverified facts about local groups,
institutions, or problems. The classification of local rumors will
depend on the rumors which circulate in your community.
The analysis of rumors can best be done by persons trained
in the social sciences. Local universities will general have ex-
perts on their staffs who can be asked to serve on the project and
supervise the analysis.
Rumor analysis should indicate what rumors are being spread,
how widely, and in what circles. Such analyses reveal what the rumor
problems are, how serious they are, and toward whom information must
be directed.

Control Programs--Information
Once it has been decided to blanket a given field of rumors
with information, all outlet available to the project should be used.
These should include newspapers, group and club publications, lectures,
before civic and club groups, radio interviews, speeches or programs,
pamphlets, school projects, library displays, discussion group mater-
ials, etc. The project might consider the value of asking editors
to contribute space for columns called "Did You Know That?" or "Things
You Ought to Know," the project providing colorful and dramatic informa-
tion designed to fight rumors without specifically mentioning them.

The Continuing Program
In addition to the special educational campaigns worked out
on the basis of informational gaps, the continuing purpose of a rumor-
control project is to toughen people's minds against rumors and the
repetition of rumors.
