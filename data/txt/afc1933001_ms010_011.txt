John A. Lomax, Esq.
General Delivery
Detroit, Michigan

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The machine, records, and all that goes with it, have been sent
to Mr. Garwick in New York. It was my belief that you were going
to make further tests under Mr. Garwick's supervision. He does not
think that he can come to Washington in the immediate future.

Naturally, I want you to use the machine, if it helps to procure 
records for the Library. At this moment I do not quite see out 
of what fund or appropriation we can cover the charges for transportation 
to Texas,  but I'll look into it. I presume you will let me
have a definite address by return mail. 

I am supposed to see Mr. Leland one of these days, but since a 
date has not yet been set for our interview and it may suffer delay,
you might write to him directly, telling him what you have in mind,
also pointing out the interest that the Linguistic Atlas people are
taking in out Archive of American Folk-Song.

It seems to me that your letter of Nov. 18 must have consisted 
of more than two sheets. I can not see any connection between the
bottom of the first and the top of the second. This may have resulted
in my reply being vague and incomplete.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music
