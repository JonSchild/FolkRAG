Pine trees, when they're dead, the inside of 'em is full of
rosin, red, you know. You could split them up into small
peices, lie that long, and put 'em together and put a match
to the end of it and it just burn, burn, make aright light.
That rosin, if it hits you, it itches you, you now.

AL: And that was at night, out there in the road?

Nimrod: Yeah, at night. I'd go along the road at night
carrying these torches, for the old ladies to come back home
by, you know. And they get started shouthing right in that
road you know, maybe for.....I'd burn up one of my torches,
maybe I'd be walking.....and throw the whole thing down.
Then I'd have to relight a new torch, why'd they just shout.

AL: Explain to the folks what it means to shout, most people
dont' understand.....how you feel and what is shouting anyway?

Nimrod: Well, you get happy, you know, a spiritual, a good
song, and they lay on the ground and go to jumping up and
down and shouting and slapping their hands,,, for maybe 30 
minutes, a half hour. And you'd burn that torch up, it'd
burn your hands. That was real times, back in those old
times and I just loved it.... They'd have basket meetings graveyard meetings,
you know, and everybody would bring a basket, pies, .....it'd
be all over a big graveyard .....you'd get a little here, a
little there, and it was a sight, that the people would be
there....

AL: And the people that would come there would be kinda
related to each other, wouldn't they?
