effort to acquire data on the song because
I could not at the time. However, my ears
have been trained to grasp things, so that
I learned it on the spot and set it down
as soon as I could. I learn to sing with
the folk, also, so that I can sing scores of
songs which I acquire under conditions where
recording is not possible.

Sincerely,
Willis Lawrence James

N.B. While the language of the above song
is rather forthright there is a strong
note of patriotism in the song - it seems
to say that what we are accustomed to,
in the way of conveniences must be
put aside or adapted to cause of
stopping Hitler (from raisin' hell)
