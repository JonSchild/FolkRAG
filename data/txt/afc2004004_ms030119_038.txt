anythang fur me because I ast you.  Neither because I want to be
satisfied.  Don't do that.  An if yo u do a thang an don't feel like
doing it, it's gon be half done work anyhow.  cause if you don't fell
like it, it ain't gon be much joy out of it.
     (Rev. Davis, do you think that women should have an
orgasm?)
     What you mean?  Huh?
     (Do you know what an orgasm is?)
     A fuss?  Is that what you talkin bout?
     (For instance, when you make love, and you have a
sexual climax, a great feeling)
     A discharge or sumpin?
     (Yes.  An d just a temen dous feeling?  That yo u just
completely go out of the world. . . ?)
     That happen to women.  Cert'ny it happens to em some
times.  Not occasionally.  Not often.  No, not often.  They have em
every time that you git togethah an your right connection meets.
     (Do you think it happens to a man every time he makes
love?)
     Ef he's in the right attitude.  If he's not overworked
hissef.
     (How do you feel after satisfactory love making?
Relaxed?  Sleepy?)
     Aftah the thang is ovah you gonna rest, cause you
ain't gon be able to do nothin else, cause you done what youlimit
wid each otha.  Cause whatever in you to come out'se done come out.
     (Do women you've made love with make a great many
cries and shouts, and feel very ecstatic?)
     Thass a lot of put-on wid em.  Thass put on in order to
rush the man.  A man'll soon kill hissef if he fool with a woman
