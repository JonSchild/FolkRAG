You got me bound in jail.                   (

If I hada known                                   (

It was gonna be this way                   ( (2)
                                                             (

                                                             (
To the ol' chain gang                         ( (2)
                                                             (
And work on the cold, hard road,    (

Work on this cold, hard road.           (

Pick in my hand                                  (
                                                             (
Shackles on my feet                          ( (2)
                                                             (
That's the way you treated me,        (

chorus: Umm, humm,
Oh my,
That's the way you treated me,
Gotta pick in my hand,
Shackles on my feet,
That's the way you treated me.
