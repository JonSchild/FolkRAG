Agricultural
1. Union organizers are going into the fields at Casa Grande, signing
workers up with the union, and getting them jobs at 60 to 87 1/2¢
per hour, when they have been making 30 to 40¢ per hour in agricultural
work. They do get them jobs where they are allowed to work a week or
two, then they are discharged and another bunch of new union recruits
are brought in. These people who have had this increased salary even
for a short time will not return to agricultural work until they
absolutely have to. (Government employee connected with Department of
Agriculture - Phoenix 8-5-42.) [*2*]
