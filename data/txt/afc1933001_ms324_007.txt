GALLANT SHIP

Singing Game #3

Three times around went the gallant ship,
And three times around went she.
And three times around went the gallant ship,
And she sank to the bottom of the sea.

"Pull her up! Pull her up!"
Cried the brave sailor boy,
"Pull her up! Pull her up!" cried he
"Pull her up! Pull her up!"
Cried the brave sailor boy
But she sank to the bottom of the sea.

Then along came a captain brave and strong,
With a great big tackle and chain.
And he dropped them down to that gallant ship,
And pulled her up again.
