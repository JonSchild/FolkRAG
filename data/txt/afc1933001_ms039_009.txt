Dr. Herbert Putnam
Library of Congress
Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Putnam:

Referring to our conversation of this morning,
I recommend that you purchase for the Music Division
a "Presto" sound recording machine which I am
told sells for $250.  The machine is inclosed in a
single case and weighs only 100 pounds.  I understand
the price is for the entire equipment including
a microphone.  If, however, this microphone is
not of the most satisfactory type for transmitting
group singing, I recommend that a microphone best 
suited for this purpose be purchased.  The additional
cost should not be more that $25 or, possibly
$50.

I am free to stat on a long collecting trip
for the Library as soon as the machine is received.

The address of the company is Presto Recording
Corporation, 139 West 19th St., New York City.

Very respectfully,

Honorary Consultant and
Curator, Archive of
American Folk Song.
