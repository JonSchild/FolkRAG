To protect me from the wind Rod Snodgrass had curled his body
in a half circle, I on the inside, and I scribbled down the words
as the song went on. The flames of the fire, blown almost parallel
to the ground, gave but feeble light, through I managed to set down
all the words. After arranging to go on a cow hunt with the boys
next day, my host took me back to the Hearst headquarters ranch
house. As he showed me to my room he said: "We used to keep this
reserved for young William Randolph Hearst when he visited the ranch.
But we don't see so much of him now that he is running so many big
newspapers." The four huge, tall bed posts supported a mattress
 high up from the floor. I first stepped on a chair to get into the 
bed. Since that night one of my chief claims to fame has been that
I once slept in the bed of William Randolph Hearst.
