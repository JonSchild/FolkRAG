[*RACISM, CONT.*]

Well, ya know, that's been 'way back in the Bible.  'Way back
there, in Joseph's time ya know.  See?  Them, ah, that woman picked aft-after
him an' then they had 'im in the chain gang!  In, in prison, ya
see, for two years.  Dreams brought 'im out, ya know.  So any-anyhow,
I'm jus' showin' ya that -- An' they ain' gonna never stop.  The
flesh gonna be (nasty- lastin'?) right on; jus' gonna be jus',
them things on...So this segregatin' business, it don't stop nothin' 
like that; it don't sen' it.  It jus' -- it don't
sen' it.
AL:  Bessie did you ever know of any cases where they really
brutalized on the people in your home town when you were younger?
I mean up there in the hills, when you were around?
BJ:  I hear talk of it.
AL:  When they mobbed somebody?
BJ:  Yeah, I hear talk of it.  I heard talk a them mobbin' peoples
an' they wanna kill the families, some of 'em.  I heard 'em talk
about it, but not there where we lived, there.  But I heard a-many,
a-many of 'em.
AL:  Where?
BJ:  Oh, around Dawson -- not Dawson -- around Cuspeth an' all
out from ah, Wil-Willey Coochin', you know out there in, in
them stick woods, ya know?  An' Pearson, all up in there, ya know,
ya know, all that on that, on them turpentine stills an' things
up in there.  I heard all that kinda stuff goin' on, ya know,
'cause peoples have to leave.  An' over the river from ah, Millen,
over there, across the river?  Tellfat County an' all that,
all that.
