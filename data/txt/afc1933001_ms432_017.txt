SHALL YOU COMPLAIN WHO FEED THE WORLD, WHO
CLOTHE THE WORLD, WHO HOUSE THE WORLD? SHALL YOU COMPLAIN ==
WHO ARE THE WORLD OF WHAT THE WORLD MAY DO? AS

POWER, THE WORLD MUST FOLLOW YOU!

2.
The world's life hangs on your right hand,
Your strong right hand, your skilled right hand.
You hold the whole world in your hand - 
See to it what you do!
Or dark or light, or wrong or right,
The world is made by you! [*2 times*]

3. 
Then rise as you ne'er rose before,
Nor hoped before, nor dared before,
And show as ne'er was shown before
The power that lies in you!
Stand all as one, till right is done!
Believe and dare and do. [*2 times*]
