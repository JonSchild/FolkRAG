Lunched yesterday very hungry, scornful of the vegetarian
food, having had no breakfast, with Embree at
the Rosenwald foundation.  After he told me what he
thought my education should consist in; I agreed with
him; he gave me two books, dismissed me very friendily.
I spent the afternoon in animated conversation with
his negro assistant, a small brown, owlish fellow
named Gunther, who is a charming, timid, self-controlled
[?talker?].  At Mr. Embree's & my suggestion he
is to get together a Negro audience for me later
in the week.  That will be an exciting and very revealing
adventure.

In the meantime there are as many visits to be made, as
[many] much talking to be done as I have strength & time.
The mail has not come.  Nothing.  Hope you are strong and
well.  If you need me, holler.
                      Alan
