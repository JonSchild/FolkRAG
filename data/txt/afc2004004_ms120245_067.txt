invisibly in the bush and eat people. 
They come to you & you fall sick
 a houngan can rid you of 
them but they immediately go in 
search of another man. When you 
serve them you are always in danger 
of being eaten, because they come 
to you & won't leave if they don't 
have their appetitites[sic]  satisfied. 
They eat your [bourigues?] your horses. 
You have to spend a lot of money 
feeding them - everything has to be 
new - they want cows, goats, 
dogs, chickens
You cut a piece off of each ear & 
the tail of the dog & catch some blood 
in a cup - this mixture you 
give to Loi Moundong - [somet] the 
dog is released but he always dies 
at once - sometimes they cook 
& eat the whole dog -
Ti Jean Petro - goat & pig
by himself -
