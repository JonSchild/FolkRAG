Professor of English. Both are
authorities in the ballad field.
I can't recall the Professor's
name, but I think he would
help you. I could also testify
that Negroes in every Southern
state sang to me the song with
a [the] refrain similar to Blind
Jesse's.

In deciding on Christmas, please
remember that you can't expect
to [have] spend many more Holidays
around the home fireplace
with my chair occupied. I
do hope you can come.

I am glad you were
pleased with your last program.
I was on the jury trying a white
man for sodomy and couldn't
get away. Miss Terrill
