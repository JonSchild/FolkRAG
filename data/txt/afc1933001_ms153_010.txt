Dear Mr. Lomax, 
Please forgive delay in answering your letter, which 
arrived during the Christmas rush. It was nice to hear from you. 

I shall be glad to have you use the sea chanteys of 
"Sailor Dad" Hunt. I should like, however, to have you give 
acknowledgment not only for Study Ammo but for Haul Away, My Rosie, 
as I have already used both. As a matter of fact, I've used all 
of his chanteys that he could remember, and others of his songs, 
either in setting already published, or in books already spoken 
for by publishers and only waiting until I can get them to press. 
I also used Haul Away, My Rosie in the address I gave in New York 
for the folk program of International Music Congress; and of course, sent 
the address on afterward for publication with the others. 

Should you not also give acknowledgment to J. Fischer & Bro., 
N.Y.C. (119 West 40th St.) publisher of my setting of Santy Anno? I 
believe g. Schirmer, 3 East 43d St. , is publishing the Music Congress 
addresses, under auspices of the American Musicological SOciety. 

It occurs to me that I have already given permission to 
Alton C. Morris, editor of Southern Folklore, (though his address is 
at present, Box 44, Chapel Hill, N.C.) to use all of Sailor Dad's 
chanteys that I had, for a thesis he was writing for degree at U. of N.C. 
These were counted as being from Florida, as Mr. Hunt had lived there 
for a while, and the thesis was on Florida folksong. I do not know
whether you would also have to get his permission or not, but should not 
think so. I believe absolutely in one folklorist standing by another, and 
helping out with material or anything else, whenever needed!  However,
that theory has resulted, so far, in my having sent around so much of 
my own best material before I had a chance to use it myself, it may rather
complicate matters as for as permission for use is concerned.  I do not
believe I have given any one else these particular chanteys, though -
except John Powell, whom I gave several hundred of my folk songs and 
tunes.  I believe he has some of these, either from me or direct from 
Mr. Hunt, though he has not published any of them. So far as I know, 
with my own permission, Sailor Dad's, and perhaps the two publishers 
mentioned, the coast is clear! 

I am anxious to see your book when published. I am reviewing 
Jean Thomas' last book for Southern Literary Messenger, and another recent 
folklore publication for Southern Folklore. Tell your father that his 
Cowboy Songs is one of the first folk publications I ever owned, and I 
still use it constantly; and also treasure the American Ballads and Folksongs 
by you both. Have you ever seen my own Folk Hymns of America? You'll 
find many secular tunes quoted in notes, as variants of the hymn-melodies. 
Cordially, 
Annabel Morris Buchanan
