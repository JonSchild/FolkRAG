San Antonio, August 7 -

"A boy friend of a girl I know was on the staff of the Army's
William Beaumont Hospital at El Paso.  He was through here on his way to
Camp Livingston a few days ago.  He said that he was being sent there
because of 500 cases of yellow jaundice, resulting from serum they've
given the boys there.  He said the surgeon-general had reported 29,000
cases of jaundice in the Army, with 70 deaths."
