Dear Alan: I've been in bed two
days from a nasty cold.
Not during this century has
Texas seen such a continuous
spell of freezing weather, dropping
one night in Dallas to zero.

Macmillans write me
that they have received a complete
and satisfactory manuscript
of [the] This Singing Country
Also they enclose the balance
due on their advance on the
prospective royalties - $500.00.
Under our arrangement $166.66
