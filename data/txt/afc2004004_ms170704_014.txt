Kaelin's no sin, (do)           ava,

 It was nae lawful, lawyers would no lon it
If it was nae blessed, meenisters would nae do it,
If it was nae worth takin, lassies would nae tak it
If it was nae plenty, [the] pore folks would nae get it 

I,6
Whistlin I'll come tae ye, me lad,
Whistlin I'll come tae ye, me lad,
Tho fathers & mothers & a 'should gae mad,
Just whistle & I'll come tae you me lad

At kirk or at market where e'er you meet me.
Pass by me as tho you cared no a flea,
Just give me a blink o your bonny black ee 
And lookit as tho you cared no for me
