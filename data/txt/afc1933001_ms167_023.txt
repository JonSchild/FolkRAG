Dear Alan:
Thanks for the check for 
the book -- sorry I had to ask
for it as I would certainly like 
to give it to you if I could 
afford it.
It seems very nice here,
the girls are ok good looking 
almost as much so as in Dallas, Texas.
I'm taking graduate work in Speech + 
English.
your friend Frank Donovan, Jr
