Mr. Rosten                - 3 -                October 13, 1942

has started a series of "Rumor Debunker" columns under a by-line of James
Colvin.  It reports that the OCD for metropolitan Chicago has approved such
direct action attacks on rumormongers and the OCD's morale advisory committee
is working out a permanent program with such an aim.  This office has
recently received a communication from Felix Fantus of Chicago concerning
rumor clinics, but I do not have at hand the material on this.

        Minnesota.  Minneapolis.  A. J. Kilday of the hotel, restaurant,
and bartenders' union organization has written in for guidance on the establishment
of rumor clinic.

        Wisconsin.  Eau Claire.  B. B. Bezanson has been appointed chairman
of the rumor clinic committee by the Junior Chamber of Commerce and has
proximity to the Eau Claire Ordnance Plant.

        Missouri.  Discussions by Gerald B. Norris of the FBI in St.
Louis, and Harry D. McBride, local Civilian Defense Coordinator, has led
the establishment of a rumor clinic under the St. Louis Civilian Defense Council.
The results of the studies are to be printed in "On Guard", a CD
publication.

        Oregon.  The State Defense Counsel of Oregon has established a
special unit for the study and counteraction of rumor, and David Robinson
has been designated the director, Mr. Robinson has written in to this
office for guidance.

        Washington.  In Seattle, George H. Weber, Chairman of the Public
Information Section of the Civilian War Commission, has called for the establishment
of a rumor clinic similar "to those in Boston and Philadelphia."

        This is the list based on materials at hand.  It is additionally
incomplete.  If it is necessary or desirable to get further information or
to bring this list up to date, it can be done in a reasonably short time.
I hope this serves the present needs.
