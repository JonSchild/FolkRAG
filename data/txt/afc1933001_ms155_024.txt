Mrs. Corinna Brown
806 N. 15th Street
Waco, Texas

Dear Mrs. Brown:

I enjoyed your letter and the songs that you
sent in more than I can tell you. It was very
pleasant for me to hear from Waco, for it's
only a few miles from the town in which I was
born.

I want to use both of your songs on my program
of April 16th, and in order to do this I would
have to have the tunes written down, and besides,
have your signature on the enclosed letter of
permission. I'm sure that if you went to some
local music teacher or friend of yours who knows
music, they will be glad to write these tunes
down. Do you know other old songs besides the
two that you sent me? Send me a list of them
and perhaps I can ask my father to come by to
see you some day and make records of them. I
would like to hear from you within a week.
With best regards, I am,

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
