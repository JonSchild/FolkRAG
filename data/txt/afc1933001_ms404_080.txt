Henry Truvillion
However, the manager did agree for us
to meet the [?] on which brought
in the men at four p.m. from the [?],
set up our machine along side of
the tracks near the machine shops, where
our cable could reach for electric
connections, and have Henry Truvillion
and his men [?] lay some tracks
for us. At least this simulation of
the [?s] as they sang would be
against real ties and rails. But
sad to say at the last moment we
found that the electric current ran
400 volts instead of 110. There
were no batteries available and
nothing could be done about it.
After all we did take
Henry and some of his me up
to the [factor] Community where they 
went through the motions of doing
the labor. But only Henry was interested
and the record came out indifferently.
