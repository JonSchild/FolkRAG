New York City

Dear Miss Scott:

Mr. Farnell is connected with Sam Goldwyn, Inc. -- publicity
director I think.  I understand he's now out of town but 
I wish you'd look into the matter anyway.

The number of lectures that I have now scarcely take 
care of the commission and publicity costs up to this point,
but if you feel that I will actually be in somebody's debt by 
also advertising in the special issue of Program, I'll go 
ahead with it.  I'll see you in New York in the next couple 
of weeks.

Best regards,
Alan Lomax
