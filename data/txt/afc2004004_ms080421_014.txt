we didn't have any roads. I remember when the first fertile come in
this country, and I'm 60. I was 60 years old, uh, the 29th of this month, of
this past month, August, and today, I think, is the eight of September.
AL: Let's go down and take just one final thing Jim of him standing in
the cornfield 'cause it's taller than he is. You say how tall
you are, Ray, and how tall your people are and that'll do just fine.
RH: Right here now is the, is the corn. Now this is a, I lost the 
seed, is we give away this as the seed. It come out and this gonna
be part of, it'll get ripe probably if this month stays out good. Uh,
now I used to raise a little cobless corn, it didn't get over this
high. Now I'm, I'm 6'7" barefooted. And this here, here' sone, it
must be round about 9 or 10, 8 or 9 or 19 feet, must be about 9 or 10
feet tall.
AL: And you raise it all without a drop of fertilizer.
RH: And I raised, this here growed. And they say, like one said
uh, "you just make a half a crop." Well, now, you look in here, if that
would get ripe, would have been a earlier corn, that is a yield for this
country. We been a cold, late-season country here, but it ain't as
cold as some countries, late, and this--that would be a yield for this
country. And so now of the wisdom, is you learned how to, with your
feelin's if you get on it, you learn how to cultivate that and put that
stuff on it when it needs it. And, and uh, and uh, and the furthest
part about it with me, I had the beans there and the bean beetle is
bad anymore ... been for years that Mexican bean beetle,
and I was aputtin' the fertile on it and they wasn't but two or three
... is even bit with a bean beetle, it about broke the
seed of 'em, I mean. Ashes and ... is what they used to use
