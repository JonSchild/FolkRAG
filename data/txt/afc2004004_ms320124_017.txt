BARRY ANCELET   -16
through the history of European music it's, it's fiddle and 
wind instruments in an accompanying relationship that. . .
ANCELET  They play that way in France.
LOMAX  Why?  Why?
ANCELET  [CLEARS THROAT]  Plateu, the
standard band in Plateu is the accordian and fiddle and 
maybe a trumpet or a, or some kind of. . .
LOMAX  In the old days of course you had
the, the, the. . .
ANCELET  The bagpipes.
LOMAX  . . .the bagpipe instead of the 
accordian.
ANCELET  And you know with the self
accompanying drone that the Arcadian, the Cajun fiddlers

LOMAX  Right.  Right.  Well, we're
talking about a long time before your day.  In those days,
it was just the beginning of the recording.  And there was
still a lot of unaccompanyed singing in traditional French
style.  But now the whole thing is suddenly a, a rich
blooming of this recorded style that Joe Falcon and others
were playing.  Could you tell us about, a bit about that?
ANCELET  Go back and come back?
