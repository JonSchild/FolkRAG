[music score]

She told me that she was go - ing a - way_
How I plead-ed cause I need - ed some - one to love_ She
used to hug and kiss and call me tur - tle dove_ And
when I found she was real-ly gone Lord-y how I wept and mourned.

And I am blue just as blue as can be_
Do I love her yes I love her Lord on - ly knows I
love my lov - ing ba - by an y where she goes_ And
if she does-n't come back to me I'll go cra-zy as can be. ___
