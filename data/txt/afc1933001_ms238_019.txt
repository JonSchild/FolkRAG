Knows many of the songs in the "Lomax Cowboy Ballads" but had never seen a
copy of the book
Could sing through entire morning (so daughter says) to her children
never singing the same song twice
Nancy Humble Griffin, 86 years old October, 1941. Moved to Texas from Louisiana
when she was two. Settled in Polk County. Married Oliver Griffin, 1872.
Mother of ten living children. Until the last few years has been able to 
sing from memory as many as 100 old songs. Now blind. She can recall and
sing at present 25 or 30 songs or parts of them, many of them very old. She
usually remembers the whole song after she starts singing. She did accompany
herself on an accordion, but is no longer strong enough. It is necessary
for her to sing the songs in order to recall them. One can tell by the
measure and rhyme that her memory of them is accurate. Learned them all
from hearing them, and developed her accompaniment "by ear". Many of them
she learned from people who stopped overnight with the Olivers as they
traveled through the ranch country around Fredericksburg.

BLIND MAN'S LAMENT
I NOW WILL OF MY SORROWS TELL
FOR THEY I DO REMEMBER WELL
BY BLASTING ROCK I LOST MY SIGHT
WHICH TURNED MY DAYS ALL INTO NIGHT

AWAY HERE IN TEXAS
AWAY HERE IN TEXAS
SO FAR FROM MY HOME
AWAY HERE IN TEXAS
SO LONELY I ROAM

DYING CALIFORNIAN
LAY UP NEARER, BROTHER, NEARER
FOR MY LIMBS ARE GROWING OLD
THY PRESENCE SEEMETH NEARER
WHEN THEY ARMS AROUND ME FOLD
(next verse -message back to wife)

THE IMPOSSIBLE SONG
AS YOU GO TO BOSTON TOWN
TAKE THIS REQUEST TO THAT YOUNG GIRL
(x) ROSEMARY IN TIME
TELL HER TO MAKE ME A CAMBRIC SHIRT
WITHOUT A SEAM - A SEAMSTER'S WORK
(X) SHE CAN BE A TRUE LOVER OF MINE
(next verse about ironing without an 
iron) and on and on countless verses
(may not have this one down correctly;
alternate refrain x)

MAID OF MOHEE OR MOHI
AS I SIT AMUSING MYSELF ON THE GRASS
WHO SHOULD HAPPEN ALONG BUT A YOUNG INDIAN LASS
SHE SAT DOWN BY THE SIDE OF ME
AND PRESSED MY RIGHT HAND
SYAING, YOU SEEK LIKE A STRANGE
THAT'S FAR FROM YOUR LAND
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

WHEN I FIRST CAME FROM ENGLAND
WHEN I FIRST CAME FROM ENGLAND
SOME PLEASURE FOR TO FIND
I BEHELD A MOST BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL
MOST PLESING TO MY MIND
HER CHERRY CHEEKS HER COAL BLACK EYES
LIKE CORAL PIERCED MY HEART......................
CORAL(?)
