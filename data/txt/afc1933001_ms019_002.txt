Dear Sir:
The Haskin Information Bureau recommends that I write
you.  Briefly, I want to learn of the possibility of securing aid
in my collection of songs and dances of the Tennessee Mountains.
I have spent considerable time on this problem already, and one 
man, Mr. John A. Lomax, has manifested considerable interest in
it.  I understand that you encourage such work, and I wish to know
what aid you can give me, provided that you found it to be as I
represent it.
You do not need to be told of the rich possibilities of the
Tennessee mountains, and I live in the heart of them, and daily
associate with boys and girls who come from mountain homes.  A great
work could be done right here.
Yours truly,
J. A. Rickard
