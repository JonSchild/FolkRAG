     Reverend Creel (?)   interview.  [238].
     . . .
     Yes, sir, I've been raisin' cattle . . .             I started out raisin'
. . .           calves (?)  . . .
. . .
and when they'd get up to about 200 pounds I'd sell 'em. That's were I
got my spendin' money, money to go to the fair, and [xxxxxxx] pay part of
my school expenses. Later on I became interested in establishin' a herd
of beef cattle of my own. Again I started out by buying heifers that were
half Holstein and half . . .
     . . .                you like to work with cattle, you like cattle.
     Yes, it gives me somethin' to get out of the house, it makes me get out
of the house, which in my condition I have to keep active or I get where
I can't . . .   at all.
     When you were younger- - you went into the cattle business because
. . .                                                       What    . . .                         about 'em?
     Oh, just watchin' 'em grow, seein' 'em learn to eat, learn to drink
out of bucket without having to have a nipple or maybe use your finger to
get 'em to learn to drink.
     Do you have a name for that stick you carry . . .
     Well, this serves a dual purpose. I use it in the pasture for a 
walking stick, and then the strap that you see right around here . . .
                                                     especially at weanin' time when they're
a little bit contrary about leavin' mama. This strap'll make 'em do a
lot more than I can do . . .                                      the condition that I'm in.
    Were your folks cattle people, too?
