Cox: No. At Barton. Barton Towers. Not a bad house. (pause) Oh,
we had a decent home. We were always welcome there, we called in
there. We was always happy enough.
Lomax: And a lot of music all the time, in the evenings was there?
Cox: Well, there was not so much then as there was when we grew
up. When we got a little older an' I got a-musicin'. My brother an'
sisters grww up, we used to have many a evenin'; singin', musicin',
you know. When they grew up a little. So we learnt different things.
Then we used to have a go in.
Lomax: And you said your father learnt songs, went around the
country picking them up.
Cox: No. . . when he went to sea, he dropped in with different people
about there, an' a lot of places besides
an' if he heard a song that he liked he got them to larn him it.
Lomax: How did he go about that?
Cox: How? How'd he go there?
Lomax: No, how'd he go about learning it?
Cox: Oh, he'd - he'd give 'em a couple o' shillin's to keep readin'
it over to him, or sing it over to him. Then he'd pick it up.
That's how he learnt it.
