Could you send 
on to Bess , she to
Shirley to be
returned to me. I
think of making a
book of his letter.

Dear Lomax:
In the seclusion of your woody retreat,
now whitened by the recent snow, with good oak wood
and a wide fireplace, in the company of an extremely
intelligent woman, take my advice and get from the
library, the following work:
LIFE OF VOLTAIRE, by James Parton
You and the aforesaid intelligent woman begin
reading this two-volume affair  in a leisurely way.
The first 30 or 40 pages may seem a little dull, but
it is a necessary background for the delights that are to
come.   There is not in the same compass in the English
language more wit, wisdom, sound philosophy, drama,
adventure, humor, combined with  an authentic report of
the most astounding personality in all literary history.
The book is a liberal education.
Have I just discovered this work published in
the 1880s?   By no means. I read it twenty years ago,
but I was immature then. I am re-reading it now in the
years which bring the philosophic mind.   But I am reading
it under handicaps which you will not suffer in the aforesaid
retreat, which was really built to enjoy just such books as 
this.
Always with great affection.   Bedi.
