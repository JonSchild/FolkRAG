Dear Alan: Your telegram with Mr.
Spivacke's decision has just been received.
Before the inertia and governmental
red tape I acknowledge
defeat. Now, Ill relax and try to
finish the story of my Adventures.
Should they never be printed, a likely
supposition - when you grow
older and become more patient
with my foibles and failures
maybe you'll read 'em. Johnny
will too, I feel sure. So I shall 
persist in writing 'em down.
At least for the present I can
promise fewer letters from me
to distract you from your regular
work.
