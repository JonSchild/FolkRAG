I return Mr. Leland's letter which you
may keep. Again I suggest
that you owe him some
special attention, even if he is
too busy to accept your courtesies.

I have sent to Jerry, at his
request, the per diem of my
two trips; also Frank Goodwyn's
account. I am left, with both
these statements paid still in the
hole, but make no complaint
now or in the future.

I asked Mr. Evans how
you are getting along. All that
he said was very much in 
your favor. I recall that I
mentioned this interview without
going into particulars.

Bess stands high in favor with
Columbia. Smith is a complete flop.
If Bess doesn't get a job it will
be only because they have no jobs to hand out.
