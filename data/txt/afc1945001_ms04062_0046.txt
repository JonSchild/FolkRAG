4. A soldier, a private who said he had recently been demoted from sergeant, was overheard telling a group of young women that in his outfit, a national guard unit, the company commander had just "busted" all non-commissioned officers in the outfit and appointed in their places draftees who had been recently trained under the non-commissioned officers. He said that an appeal had been made to the regimental commander by some of the demoted non-commissioned officers and that the Colonel stated that the company commander had a right to take this action and that nothing could be done about it. The soldier said that "there were plenty of fist fights" over the incident. He claimed that whole he was a sergeant he had been recommended by least two officers as capable of performing the duties of commissioned officer. He said that the company was completely demoralized by the company commander's disciplinary action, and he insisted that the only reason the company commander had for demoting the non-commissioned officers that the officer's dislike of national guardsmen.
