As you well know, a
record-maker can't 
control his time. He 
must work nights,
Sundays, hurry to keep
engagements, dash from 
town to town.  We two 
are just about worked
out.  As Richard [Amoson?]
as he suddenly 
ended a long song about 
"Dot's all. I done completed
all the premises of de
proposition."
