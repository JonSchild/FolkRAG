[went up] walked on an' stood there at the foot of the bed.  She much ah, stout,
ya know.  Talkin' to me, went right on.  An' says she. . .I asked
her 'bout the cookin'.   She said she want someone to cook for 'er,
you know, breakfas' an, an' jus' fix lunch for the chirrun an'
myse'f.   Not for her an' her husban, ya know, 'cause he worked
out.   An' ah, I begin to feel more -- [But] Yet,  but she didn' look up
enough for me; I, I was lookin' at 'er on the side.   An' ah,
she says, um, an' [ah] then you know, at night, I cook supper, ya know.  I don't
ha' to stay to -- over there, if I don't want to, ya know; jus'
cook it, ya know, for her.  Or either, if I want to, I could
stay.
         She stay, "Bulla'll carry ya home every night."  That was
sumpin'.  That sounded. . .Everythin' gittin' better, an' better.
         An' so, I said, "What ya pay?"
         She said, said, "Well," said, "I'll tell ya.  Ah, ah, now
I'll start ya off with thirty-five dollars a week."  Said, "But
as things get better, I'll pay ya more."
         I had never made over fi' dollars in my life.  A week.  Ya
see.  I looked out the window, very concerned.  An' so.  Oh Lawd, I
was so glad, I didn't know what to do; but she didn't know that.
I said, "Well," I said, "I'll, I'll take it at that.  I'll try."
         An' so, I went on in the kitchen.  When I went in that
kitchen, oww!  She tol' me go in there an' get me sumpin' to eat
if I wanted it.  Tol' 'er I wanted get me some water.  I needed
water; she didn't know that.
         I went in that kitchen, and brother, you talk about somebody
talkin' to the Man Upstairs.  I prayed to the Man Upstairs, ya
hear me?  I asked God one, single question an' He did it.  I meant
it.  I was so glad I didn't know what on earth to do.
