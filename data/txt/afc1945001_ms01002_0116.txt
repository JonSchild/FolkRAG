E.   A Measurement of the Penetration of Specific Rumors.

Here the Polls Division will measure the relative degree
of penetration of several specific rationing rumors among
various groups and in different areas. These rumors would
be chosen so as to duplicate or parallel the Axis theme
on the subject.

The interviewers will ask a national cross-section of the 
population whether they had heard the rumors; if so, who
told them; whether they believed the rumors, and to what 
sources the accounts had been attributed.

Ideally, this study should be continued for a specified 
period on a "panel" cross-section.  Later, this technique 
of penetration measurement could be expanded to include a 
continuing check on the efficacy of various methods of 
rumor counteraction employed in a  series of comparable
communities.  Or, it might be employed to evaluate efforts 
at prior immunization.

F.   Collation of Data; Conclusions and Recommendations.

To the Special Services Division is properly assigned the
task of collating and synthesizing all data and indices
gathered through the above means.

The question that the Special Services Division will be responsible 
for answering is  ---  "How?" (How did the rumors
start - who started them - how and why did they grow - how
and why did they die?) This will be an attempt to evolve
a rumor pattern in terms of origin, growth, and death, and 
it will involve a consideration of the psychological factors
implicit in rumor receptivity.

We should expect, from this synthesis, not alone specific
recommendations for informational policy with respect to
rationing, but also generalizations regarding the overall
relationship of information and rumor.
