Macpherson [stand to be sentenced] rise up for sentence ...

Voice: (on echo) For as mickle as you  James Macpherson
are found guilty to be [known] Egytians and
vagabonds + oppressors of his majesties
free lieges (fading) and going up & down the country
armed and that 
you are thieves &
receptors of thieves

Woman:   [They armed] All they say
is he's a gypsy!

Man:   And the Lairds are bigger thieves!  
therefore the sherrif deput of Banff adjudges
you to be hanged by the neck by the
Common executioner upon Friday next the 16 day of November
1700...

Sherif:  James Macpherson have you anything to say
[against] before this sentence is passed against you.

Macpherson:  My lord [the] sherrif of Banff it is the Laird
of Grant who hangs me, not yourself.
I am guilty of taking a few sheep &
[feeding] giving them to, my people  - guilty of playing the fiddle -
while the sanctimonious Laird [squeezes the]
steals whole farms & plays upon the
purse strings of [a whole countryside] all Buchan-

Laird: Sherif, I demand you stop this [man's] knave's
slanders.

[Sherif: ?]
[Macpherson:  He is afraid of my gypsy fiddle -
& more of my [word] sword - if I would
only break these bands - I'd drive it]
