MRS. DAVIS:
Yes, he did this Concert they had it on the Times, it was the last concert.
LARRY:
It was in April wasn't it.
MRS. DAVIS:
Probably it was, but anyway that was the last concert he did. He was too ill to do that. I pleased with him not to go, but he went. But that was the last concert that he did.
LARRY:
You know when he was in the hospital he, well you told me about it first. something just told me to be slow in telling him that I was, he asked me to do the job. A lot of people would have said O. Yeah, I'll do it. But you know there ain't many people can do a job for Gary and I don't want to be in the number that even trys because I don't feel like I would do it justice and I just rather, let him do it. And I'm glad I told him Brother Davis, maybe you'll be able to do it. You know I say I will do it but I believe you'll be able to do it.
MRS. DAVIS:
He wasn't to able, but he went and did it anyway. And he of course enjoyed it. I didn't go with him because he came I wasn't ready to go with him, but it was a very, very nice Concert although he wasn't too well but he made a nice Concert that night.
LIONEL:
Where was that?
