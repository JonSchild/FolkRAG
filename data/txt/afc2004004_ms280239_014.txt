The Laird o' Drum:
1) The Laird o' Drum is a hunting gane
Al in a morning early;
And there he spied a weel fair maid
Shearing her father's barley.

2) "And would ye fancy me, bonny maid,
And let the shearing be-o?
And I'll make ye the Lady O' Drum
O would you fancy me-o."

3) "I wouldnae fancy you, kind sir,
Beyond any man I see-o.
For I am come o' owre low kin,
AND your wife I canna be-o."

4) "My father he's an old shepherman
Herds sheep in yonder hillo.
And everything he bids me do,
I am ready at his goodwill-o.

5) So he has to her father gang
Wi' his hogs on yonder hill-o.
"I want to marry your daughter, kind sir,
Will you gie me your goodwill-o?"

6) "I willna gie my daughter," he says,
She was never at the school-o.
Though weel can she milk cows and kine,
Wi' a coggie on her knee-o."

7) "She'll whinnie your corn and gang to the barn,
And unto mill or kell-o.
She'll saddle your steed in time o' need
And draw your beets hersel'-o.

8) And who will bake my bridal bread
And who will brew my ale-o,
And who will welcome my lady home
It's mair than I can tell-o.

9) O she will bake your bridal bread,
And she will brew your ale-o,
And wha would welcome your lady home
But the Laird o' Drum himself-o.

10) And five and twenty gentlemen stood at the gate o' Drum-o,
And never a ane put his hand to his hat tae welcome the lady hame-o,

11) But he has ta'en her by the hand and he has lain her but 'bend-o,
And he put the keys into her right hand, and he's welcomed her hame himself-o.
