Memo to Dr. Harold Spivack, Chief of Music Division
from Alan Lomax, Archive of American Folk Song. 

I recommend that duplicates of Mr. and Mrs.
Ball's recordings be sent them as promised by John A.
Lomax. This would amount to the duplication of three
records.

To Mr. Lomax, 
OK - records to be taken
from current supply.
