Dear Mr. Foreman:

Permit me to thank you for the many
courtesies extended to Mr. Alan Lomax of this
Division on his recent trip to Camden.  He
made consideration progress in the preparation
of the bibliography of American Folk music
available on commercial disks.  Mr. Lomax
informed me, however, that a considerable 
number of records were collected for his use
but that he could not examine them carefully
in the limited time.  I am enclosing a list
of these records and I wonder if it would be
possible for you to send them to the Library
so that Mr. Lomax could give them attention
that they deserve.  I am enclosing twelve
franked labels for the purpose of shipmint.

Again let me thank you for your cooperation.

Very sincerely yours,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
