looked at me like she thought I was pretty and her boy-friend started to 
come for me with his knife.  Some people are crazy when they get jealous. 
I grabbed a beer bottle from the top of the piano and told him to come on 
with his goddam knife.  We circled around for a minute and then my friend
Coon Can George walked in from down stairs.  He always carried a big six--
shooter in his belt with a ring in the butt so he could get after it easy,
and when he saw I was in trouble he pulled at he ring.  The guy with the 
knife got lost in the crowd before George could get his gun out.  I was
strong from then on and nobody bothered me. 
One day Buster Brown and Alto Lane, the smoothest gambling sharks 
that ever cut cards came to town. They were both down on their luck and 
hadn't had a beth in amonth. They didn't have enough money to sleep in the
saloons and every day they used to go down to the river to wash their feet. 
They wanted me to lend them fifty dollars to take the crap game at the Monarch.
I told them they had to take the toughest rack men in the world, but they 
said they could take Jesus Christ in a crap game.  Anyhow, they fianally persuaded 
me to get them the fifty.  The agreement was that they would rake in 
two hundred, pay me  back my fifty with twenty--five to boot and skip town. I 
knew they were slick, of course, so I got some money from Blanche, sporting 
I was living [with] off of [and] then and told them to go ahead but to take George
Frazier's watch, not Bad Sam's. Bad Sam was my friend. 
Talk about nerve, those guys had it. They walked into Monarch 
one night, tragged and dirty, with a pair of loaded dice and took the dice.  
Now in the Monarch, you had to shoot from a leather horn with a string across 
the mouth [of] to trip the dice, this making it harder to pull any funny stuff.
