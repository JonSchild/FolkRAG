the ah wonderful rhythm of the, of the drive
wheels and the sound of the -wailing sound
of the lonesome railroad whistle became part
and parcel of Southern music. We don't know who
was the first one to play the ah train songs.
Probably it happened on ah the harmonica, and 
the person that we know most about is a black man 
named D. Ford Bailey, who was the only black 
person to play on the first of all the big 
popular me - ah, radio shows, the Grand Old 
Oprey in Nashville.  D.Ford Bailey came on the 
air at 10 o'clock at night and played one tune 
only every single Saturday night, and every 
single Saturday night all the people who were 
learning harmonica tuned in on D. Ford Bailey 
to pick up his latest trick.

Ah, it's interesting, it was the only tune he 
was allowed to play, but he became a really 
natio - big national figure, and from that -
from his stimulus grew this ah art of the 
harmonica which is now one of the main parts 
of blues and rock and popular music. Blacks 
and white learned from D. Ford.
