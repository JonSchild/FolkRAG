Rhymn

When the Japs attack our land
And take away our cans;
We feel as though we can not put,
A pair of pants on Jappy's (censored).

If a solider doesn't grumble and grouch:
Why should we, here at home when
we can do without.

Says a Grocerer:
"Meat, Meat, meat, that's all we groceriers
here now. I wish we had the meat
to throw at them and then they wouldn't
hollar so much."
