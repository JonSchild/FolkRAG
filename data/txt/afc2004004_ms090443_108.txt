Tape 2,  Side 1,  P. 2 

Now we were   playing for them diddlyboo  stamps but I didn't care
because I could spend them in the comissary.  So he quieted down and he
didn't giv[3]e me [any] to much more trouble after  that.
So, every body paid off.  Gertrude, she was worried to death, you
know.  I guess I was just ignorant and I'm glad I was ignorant.  Everybody
paid off all up and down the line but Mr. Brown.  Mr. Brown, he didn't
pay off.  I was very upset.
You see, in one week you worked Saturday and Sunday, and the nexte 
week, they called it drag week, you'd be off Saturday and Sunday to rest.
So that Sunday everybody done paid off.  Mr. Brown, he ain't paid off.
They was sitting around there getting all up and down the corners,
like you see them ganged up, all up and down the streets, whispering how
"I ain't gonna do that," and "I ain't gonna do the other," you know. 
Monday morning, when they get up at dawn, all of them catching their
mules, Gertrude shoved me.  "All of them catching their mules out ther e," 
Gertrude says.  "You ain't going?" 
I says, "No. I ain't going.  Today's pay day with me." 
She says, "Honey," she says, "you know you can't run this here job 
by yourself." 
I said, "I'm not trying to run the job by myself.  I'm just trying
to look out for myself.  Go over and bring me some coffee." 
I didn't even get up.  I had a pair of W[h]ichita (?) dress boots,
laced up in the instep and on the side, a pair of black _____ courderoy
pants, a black turtleneck sweater, and a suede jacket.  I said,  "Get on
up there and get me some coffee."  I said,  "Look out there and see if
you see Mr. Brown up when you come back."
