[*written from Washington, D.C.*]

Dear Professor Lomax: 
I hope this is readable;  have no typewriter available
I had to have the manuscript containing my remarks on the
songs sent to you from New Haven and am following it with this. 
It seems to be pretty late now to apologize for letting
you have mt contribution so late;  I hope it was not too
much of an inconvenience, and perhaps in same way you will let
me make up for it.  Naturally, I will be eager to know whether
you will find it to the purpose.  I am hoping you will defend
your interests as author and tell me if the tone of the contributions 
does not fit the book, or if I should in some way improve 
it.  The style is not quite even, and, if you wish, I'll 
be glad to smooth it over a little more, with the help of my
wife, whose English has helped with--it/as it is now if there's
any change you'd wish to have made, send it back to me and I
shall forward it to Macmillans's speedily. 
[*I think it
will do, things 
I'm saving now
that I didn't
send it on to 
you.*] 
I have marked [*with*]------- question marks on the margins
places where I wasn't sure of things.  These places are:  1) 
[*OK*]  Statement according to which some songs were recorded from
other singers in the same prisons where Lead Belly sang for you
himself.  This, of course, is to be stricken out if wrong.. The
[*OK*]  remark about the guitar=accompaniment has an alternative form,
depending on the ustimate fate of the accompaniment.  Another 
[*OK*]  place:  1924 as the date of the copyright of Clarence William's 
You Don't Know My Mind Blues .  You may know the date of the original
publication:  would be good enough to insert it if so?
To game songs I am possibly referring by another title than the
one you are using in the book;  these may have to be corrected.
[*I didn't 
catch these 
I'll write

Thus I called "Willy de Weaver" what you call, I think, "Bad 
Man Ballad";  "Honey" I have used for I'm all Out and Down", and
perhaps another case in addition.
