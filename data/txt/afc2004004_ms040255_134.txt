ANNIE JOHNSTON: 
Ho ali hé ali chaidh an dileag ud 'nam cheann
Ho ali hé ali, ho ali, chaidh i ann.

  Ho ali...
Tacan beag am measg nan nighean
'S ann am mionaid, bi mi falbh

Ho ali hé ali, chaidh an dileag ud 'nam cheann
Ho ali hé ali, ho ali, chaidh i ann.

Gheibh [?] sibh mise nan chadal
Gheibh  [?] sibh mise nan shuain
Ho ali he ali
