38

Her heart was bound with mine by love,
Good works for to maintain;
But she is gone to Christ above,
Forever there to reign.

My loss is great - to lose my mate;
I'm like the lonesome dove;
I'll go alone, and sign and mourn
My dear and absent love.

My children cry, no mother by
To take them on her knee;
The breach is great, it doth create
Much grief, as you may see.

But why should I lament my case,
Since God hath thought it best
To take her soul from hence away
To her eternal rest?

Since it is so, let sorrows go;
My God hath sent His rod,
He doth His will, I must be still,
And know that He is God.

No. 36
Farewell, farewell to all below,
My Jesus calls and I must go;
I launch my boat upon the sea,
This land is not the land for me.

Chorus - This world is not my home,
This world is not my home,
This world is all a wilderness,
This world is not my home.

I found the winding path of sin,
A rugged path to travel in;
Beyond the chilly waves I see
The land my Savior bought for me.
