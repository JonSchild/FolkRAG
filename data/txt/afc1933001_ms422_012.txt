tance while the owner drove the ox
team. Incidentally he cooked all the
meals en route. It took the man and
boy three years to complete the
journey through the woods, over the
prairies and across the streams, not
one of the rivers between eastern
Illinois and their destination being
spanned by a bridge at that time.

When they arrived at San Antonio,
young Dornblaser crowned his culinary 
triumphs of the long journey by
cooking dinner for General Sam
Houston and his aides. Then he
bought a wild pony off the range
for eight dollars, spent a short time
breaking and training it and started
out alone on horseback on the return
trip to his father's home in Illinois."

He Died for His Faith
So he died for his faith. That is fine,
More than most of us do.
But, say, can you add to that line
That he lived for it, too?
In his death he bore witness at last
As a martyr to the truth.
Did his life do the same in the past,
From the days of his youth?
It is easy to die. Men have died
For a wish or a whim—
From bravado or passion or pride,
Was it harder for him?
But to live—every day to live out
All the truth that he dreamt,
While his friends met his conduct
with doubt
And the world with contempt.
Was it thus that he plodded ahead,
Never turning aside?
Then we'll talk of the life that he
lived.
Never mind how he died.

The Lesson of the Rain
Douglas Mallock

This is the lesson of the rain,
Engraved in grass, and etched in
grain,
A simple lesson, written plain;

In wordy wars the loud contend,
And yet the kindness of a friend
Is always victor in the end.

And so the wind of winter blows,
And in the meadow heaps the snows,
Yet never yet produced a rose.

The words of anger and of hate
Accomplish little in debate;
Truth needs no noisy advocate.

Calm wisdom, kindly meant and said,
The counsel that has comforted,
By this the minds of men are led.

'Tis not the winter's thunderings,
It is the gentle rain that brings
The beauty of our vernal springs.

Remember this—who would express
The truth, the hearts of men
possess—
The greatest force is gentleness.

We Ain't Down Yet
(Tune: Turkey in the Straw)

1.

Oh, the mule's gone lame, the hens
won't lay,
Corn's way down—wheat don't pay.
Hogs no better, steers too cheap,
Cows quit milkin', meat won't keep.

2.

Oats all heated spuds all froze,
Wheat crop's busted wind still blows,
Looks some gloomy, I'll admit.
(Spoken) Get up, Dobbin,
We ain't down yet!

3.

Oh, the coal's too high, crop's too low,
Freight rates doubled, got no show;
Money's tighter, morals loose—
Bound to git us. What's the use?

4.

Sun's not shinin' as it should,
Moon ain't beamin' like it could.
No use stoppin' to debate.
(Spoken) Git up, Dobbin—
It's gettin' late!

5.

Oh, the wheels all wobble, axle's bent,
Dashboard's broken, top all rent.
One shaft splintered, t'other sags.
Seat's all busted, endgate lags.

6.

May hang together—believe it will
Careful drivin'll make it still.
Road's smoothed out till it won't
seem true,
(Spoken) Git up, Dobbin—
We'll all pull through!

A Shadow Play

Stretch a sheet across one end
of the room, allowing space for
actors behind it. A light back of the
actors throws their shadows on the
screen. This offers possibilities for
clever make-believe and make-shift
costuming and stage properties. In
the following play, adapted from a
Chinese play, horns for the devils
are made from cardboard, the tongue
is made from flannel, etc.

The Awful Fate of a Fibber

Characters: The judge, two devils,
the recorder, and the woman. Judge
is discovered sitting in state. Devils
are blowing on fire under a kettle.
JUDGE: Is there none coming
across the river which separates life
from death?
DEVIL: One, Excellency. A woman 
only.
JUDGE: Bring her in at once.
(They drag her in by the wrists.)
(She falls on her knees before the
judge.)
JUDGE: Are you a sinner?
WOMAN: Oh, no, most gracious
judge.
JUDGE: Bring the keeper of the
book. (Recorder enters with large
book.)
RECORDER: This woman told
fibs, Excellency. All kinds of fibs.
White fibs and black fibs and just
plain gray fibs.
JUDGE: Pull out her tongue.
(With an enormous pair of tweezers
they accomplish this, pulling out a
tongue made of cloth and very long.)
(Devils fan flame and test water in
the kettle, blowing on their fingers
to cool them. They put the woman
in the kettle, she screams loudly but
finally the screams die down and
then the judge speaks.)
JUDGE: Is the punishment complete? 
Has she been boiled down?
DEVIL: Yes, Excellency.
JUDGE: Let me see.
DEVILS: Here she is. (They hold
up small doll by arms.)
JUDGE: She is yours to play with.
So perish all who tell fibs, black fibs,
white fibs or just plain gray fibs.
