Monday 3/10/41

Dear Mr. Lomax,
I came in today to 
see you. Sorry to find 
you are ill. I've got 
a terrible cold, so I won't
come by your house tonight.
It jars me to write, so 
I'll be in tomorrow & file
everything & also write your 
letters. After dinner tonight,
if I feel like it, I'll do 
the letters for the White House 
Program. See you tomorrow.

Break this bill into 3 parts so that 
it won't be a burden to you, 
Sincerely, Elise
