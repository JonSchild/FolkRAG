May 31st, 1938.

Mr. Harold Flammer,
10 E. 43rd Street,
New York City.

Dear Mr. Flammer:

John A. Lomax is abroad for the summer and I have forwarded your letter on to him.

I rather feel he might be interested in publishingX"Home on the Range" as sheet music, and I am confident you can expect a reply from him some time within a month.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
In Charge of Archive of
American Folk Song
