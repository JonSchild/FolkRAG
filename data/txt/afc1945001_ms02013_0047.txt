UTAH      No comment.

VIRGINIA

Rumor situation is not considered serious.  There
are just occasional stories of "the true Pearl
Harbor damage", large scale naval engagements off the coast, etc.
Propaganda about complete Negro equality resulting from an Axis victory
is heard quite often.

WASHINGTON

Rumors take the story form illustrating supposed
British selfishness and our about-face regarding
Russia.  Proximity to Puget Sound Navy Yard makes for caution as to
repeating rumors and to spreading the knowledge of ship movements.

WEST VIRGINIA

Rumor to effect that whole Pacific fleet was
sunk at Pearl Harbor followed the initial Japanese
attack.  Origin apparently was armchair guesswork on the part of private
persons seeking an explanation for the lack of publicized activities of
the fleet.  Such tales are no longer current, and the State is little
troubled by war whisperings.

WISCONSIN       No widespread rumors noted.

WYOMING          No problems of rumors.
