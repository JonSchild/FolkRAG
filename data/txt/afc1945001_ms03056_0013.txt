Federal Investigators Checking
Capital's Rumor Originators
By HELEN LOMBARD.
Federal intelligence services in
Washington are busy investigating
a number of individuals, some of
whom belong to what used to be
described as society. The rumor
market flourishes in the Capital,
and intelligence branches are interested
in tracking every rumor
to its source, no matter what the
percentage of truth behind it. Occasionally
he Axis has not scorned 
the use of the truthâ€”when truth
works to its advantage.
There are many honest differences
of opinion about the conduct
of the war and governmental direction
of the war effort. Criticism
of the Government is not designated
as subversive activity. But
all types of criticism that might
be enemy-inspired are of interest
to the intelligence services, whose
duty it is to ferret out enemy agents
and their stooges. Thus, a marked
defeatist attitude will lead to an
investigation which may disclose a
mysteriously swollen bank account.
A great deal of criticism of the
war effort is entirely honest, if
sometimes injudicious, and the
overfrank individuals are cleared,
generally without having known
that they had been the object of
a minute scrutiny.
Then there is a category of suspects
which falls between those who
express their impatience at Government
red tape and bungling and
those who accept bribes from Axis
sources.
This "in between" category is the
most difficult with which to deal;
for the attitudes spring from emotional
bias or political prejudices.
There is as yet no law which defines
or penalizes an emotional
state of sympathy for the Axis or
antipathy for one of our allies.
These people sometimes spread
defeatist propaganda because their
fear and hatred of the Soviets
amount to a phobia. Others are
anti-British because in the past
they were showered with flattering
attentions, from Nazi and Italian
attaches.
The first and second groups are
among the least pernicious. Both
the impatient critics and the emotionally
subversive will cease their 
disquieting talk at the news of the
first Allied victory.
Those individuals with "Cliveden"
tendencies, whose bank balances
or train of living are not 
explainable, are subjected to a most
thorough investigation.
Though criticism still flourishes
in Washington, the formerly vigorous
dissenters known as the isolationists
are not publicly participating.
Senator Nye, for instance,
once the bellwether of all isolationist
appeals, now speaks rarely from
the floor of the Senate. However,
he still has numerous calls from
sections of the United States in
which he was once the most enthusiastically
applauded platform
speaker.
A number of members of the
armed forces also have been investigated,
not because of their expressed
opinions on strategy but
because they have been suspected
of furnishing the background for
articles which have been deemed
indiscreet and prejudicial by the
authorities.
In all of these cases these men
have been cleared.
