Fisk 6. 2. HAFFER

Stand by me, Jesus. 
A: And did you go out when you got this printed, did you go out
and sing it to the people?
H : I went out to all the churches, church services and sang that. 
A: How many copies of that do you suppose you sold?
H : Well, all around, I suppose, about 3000 copies of that song. 
A: You sold them yourself?
H : Yessir. 
A:The people would even write in for the song?
H : Yessir, the people, they wrote in for it, but not as many as they
do now. No sir. I t was the first song I ever wrote. 
A: Did this song come to you under any particular inspiration? Were
you asleep or how did you write it?
H : I was asleep and the song come-- practically all of them that I 
write I imiagine I hear somebody singing --I just imagine I hear
some body singing myself and the verses come to me. Now they all don't
come to me at once -- I might get two, three verses right today; get
it off my mind and maybe a few days it'll come back right again. Sometimes
it takes maybe a week of more to get one song composed. Of
course unless it comes on, I can't write a song, unless [it comes] 
I'm moved by the Spirit. In fact, I think all of my songs are written
under inspiration. Cause I try not to write, I don't know -- I try
not to write any foolishness.

to do a lot of singing.
