Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  August 3, 1942

In talking with a party she stated that in her opinion the gasoline rationing on the
East Coast was put into effect to help fight the submarine menace on the coast and
thereby prevent individuals and gasoline station operators from supplying submarines
on the East Coast with gas, oil and other supplies that they need. This
rumor is not widespread because I only heard it once and the statement was made by
a person who is broad minded and has a good character in the locality in which she
lives. In my opinion this rumor has a good affect on the morale of the people
because it would have a tendency to show the people a good reason why the gasoline
rationing was put into affect. [*14*]
