2. A housewife, 35, said to me that she
had been told by a friend who had
just received a letter from a soldier
in a camp in Tennessee that some 
of the soldiers were deserting the
camp due to a lack of food and 
the way it was prepared, and 
also due to not having any equipment
with which to train.
