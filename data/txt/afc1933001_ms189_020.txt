For some time, I have been discussing with the Rosenwald Foundation
a project to collect folklore in the South during 1943-44. This
project will involve six fellowships, three to Negroes and three to whites,
well distributed throughout the South. These collecting fellows can act
as part-time correspondents for the Office of War Information on the
informational problems of the regions in which they work and give this office
invaluable assistance since they are trained observers.

The Library of Congress has indicated its interest in acting as
co-sponsors of this project with the Office of War Information. The folklore
phase of the project will be administered by the Library of Congress and the
war information side by the Bureau of Special Operations.

The six persons for whom I wish to make application to Rosenwald
Foundation are Professor Willis James of Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia, 
who will work in the region of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina; James
Harrison Pipes of the University of Michigan, who will make a study of Negro
holiness cults in the deep south; Myron Higgins, who will make a study of 
folklore in one community in western Tennessee under the direction of Charles
Johnson of Fiske University; Vance Randolph, authority on Ozark folklore,
who will continue his work in the Ozark region; John Vincent, Director of
Music at Western Kentucky State Teachers College, who will work in central
Kentucky; and Bess Lomax, who will make a study of the national hillbilly
music business at various key broadcasting points throughout the South and
Middle West.

The problem of gas and tire rationing comes up at once, of course,
and this has been discussed with Mr. Allen, Deputy to the Domestic Branch
of the Office of War Information. He has indicated his willingness to take
it up with OPA and find out whether they will write a letter to the local
rationing boards in the cases of four of these fellows. I should appreciate
your consideration of this problem in order that I may take the matter up 
officially with Mr. Allen. Memorandum to Mr. Allen is attached.
