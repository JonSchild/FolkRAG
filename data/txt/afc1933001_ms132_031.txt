Professor John W. Umble
Goshen College
Goshen, Indiana
Dear Professor Umble:
I regret not having met you on my visit to Goshen, if you are one tenth as pleasant company as Mrs. Umble and your son. Certainly we did appreciate the friendly help they gave us. Amish hymns are a valuable and unusual addition to the Library's collection. It is a pity that both Brother Bontreger and ourselves were in such a hurry that we couldn't record all of the twenty-one "melodies" of the Amish, but on my next visit to Goshen, which I hope will be a little more leisurely, all of the tunes will be taken down.
In the meantime, let me thank you for your help in the name of the Library and the Archive. The Amish music seems to be very old, indeed, and I hope you plan to make an extended historical and social study of it. If there is any way I can assist you in this enterprize, I should be delighted.
With my best regards to Mrs. Umble and your son, I am 
Very sincerely,
Assistant in Charge
