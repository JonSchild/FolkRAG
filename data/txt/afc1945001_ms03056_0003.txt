RUMOR: Washington, D. C.
August 3
This story was told to the writer by his brother as being
current in Canada; the brother having just returned from Montreal.
There are interests in both Great Britain and the Unites States
who would like to see Germany and Russia continue to fight until both
are nearly exhausted before opening up a second front. In Canada,
most of the blame is placed upon the United States. The explanation
for this attitude on the part of these persons in high official circles,
according to the rumor, is fear of communism.
