Gentlemen:

As a beneficiary of the Corporation for the year 1934
I wish briefly to report on my activities for that period
in collecting and recording American folk-songs.

1) The result of the year's work is embodied in 200
fourteen inch aluminum discs on which are recorded
the tunes of approximately 600 songs, including variants,
and in numerous transcriptions of songs not worthy
of recordings. These recordings were made in nine states:
Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia,
Tennessee, and North and South Carolina. The car
in which we traveled records a mileage of more than
32,000.

3) The songs are of five main types: French-Negro, Acadian,
Mexican, Negro and Mountain White. We have made adequate 
preliminary surveys of folk-singing among the
French of Southwestern Louisiana and Negro convicts in
Southern penetentiaries, rich fields that had hitherto
remained unstudied. The Negro convict still finds use for
the work-songs that at one time were current in the "free-world".
We made an intensive study of a remarkable white 
family in Austin, Texas, the repository of twenty Child
ballads and at least 200 other folk-songs. A number of
game-songs, Frendh, Mexican, Negro and Mountain White were
recorded.

4) None of the collection made in 1934 is included in
"American Ballads and Folk-Songs", John A. and Alan Lomax,
published in November.

5) I spent including replacements of two accidents, during
the year $1500 in excess of the grant kindly made to me.

6) The great territory covered necessitated hurried work.
From three to five years collecting might serve to bring
about an adequate collection of the folk-song material
current in this country.
