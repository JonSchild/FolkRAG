Dear Mr. Lomax,
I am writing to tell you what pleasure your
programme "Memories of a Ballad Hunter" has given me.
Your own contributions to the programme are excellent.
In particular your conversation with the Negro [Bama
I think you called him.] was most moving, and one could
feel the hopeless sense of despair , which the prison gate
clanging shut behind this man must have produced at
the time.
May you long continue to bring us your
records of outstanding beauty.
Yours sincerely
Sidney. G. Morgan.
