(You don't mean that you made love to a girl?)
Thass right.
(Who was she?)
Oh! I couldn't tell who.
(You wouldn't tell who?)
Uh-huh. . .

But the story of it might be interesting.)

rather cagey.) Sometimes huh mothah would come ovah home. Sometimes 
all of us would spend the night. At their house. We children slep

enough of it. Aftah I married . . .
