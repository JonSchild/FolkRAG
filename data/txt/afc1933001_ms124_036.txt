Mr. -
Superintendent of Schools
, Ky.

Dear Mr,

For the past several years the Library of Congress has been engaged
in building an Archive of American Folk-Song, to serve as a national
depository for phonograph records of American folk-music, that is,
the old ballads, reels, hymns, cowboy songs and the like that have been
handed down from generation to generation or have been composed
by and sung by people without the aid of writing or print.

The Library has already accumulated thousands of songs from all over
the country, particularly from the Southern States, but [for various reasons,]
Eastern Kentucky, which we believe to be very rich in this type
of material, is not very well represented in our collection.  For that
reason I am being sent to Eastern Kentucky on the first of September for
a two months survey of the folk-music in this section.  I shall bring
with me a portable machine that makes excellent records and I will be
interested in meeting and recording the singing, the fiddling or the
dancing of all the individuals who know the old songs, tunes or dances.
When these records shall have been made, they will be deposited in the Library
of Congress for the use, instruction and pleasure of the American people.

I feel sure that you, as county superintendent of schools, can be of
great assistance to the Library in your section of Kentucky.  It is not
unlikely that you now many people who are good singers or good fiddlers
and perhaps may you know of some occasion, such as a Sacred Harp Singing Meet or an old
fiddlers' contest or a family reunion [that would be interesting to me and]
where the Library's project could be furthered.

I should greatly appreciate a letter from you giving me whatever information
you can in regard to the music of your county and I should like
to know at the same time whether or not you think you could help me, or
would interested in doing so, when I visit your county this fall with the
Library's recording machine.

I leave Washington for Kentucky on September the first and I hope to
hear from you before that time. If it happens that your letter
reaches the Library after Sept. 1, I will be forwarded to me in
Kentucky.

                                               Sincerely yours,
