My spirits were sadly depressed; I could scarcely refrain from tears;  for a night voyage of 30 or 40 miles in an open boat in rough weather, with the constant dread of being [?] by one of the numerous vessels flying about, & the responsibility of the act I had undertaken, so evidently depressed me, that the prince exerted himself to the utmost to pass off my anxiety. He was the most composed of the party, for even the boatmen were alarmed by the storm. So, to amuse us, he told many curious anecdotes, and sang —oh! he had a charming voice—, several songs, one was a lively air composed on the restoration of his great-uncle, Charles II, of England.
