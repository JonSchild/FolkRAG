the law makes the family put their hands
in the calbasse after the leaves - & wash-
"Fe pou moin, adieu
Mama mourir, papa
Mouz a ganga moen quitter
derrien
CÃ© frou' moin pou' aller
Simbi - en - de - zo | Gende ca oufe 'ru
Cay moin brule'|
lead by mait' habitation - they still
wash their faces & hands.

Jou moin mouri ni pas ble'
ganga connais point moin.
The ganga has done a freds with
the fire behind the tree & the devil
says - 
The loi are all quiet - having their
leaf both -
The ganga says there is nothing
here to hold him, he's not afraid of 
the devil
Point ce' point
Ce' point in' ape cherchez
= Ce' point menen nivin est
