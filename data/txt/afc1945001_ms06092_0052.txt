August 3: While standing in front of the Denver Post, which 
on that day displayed in its windows the news item 
that Gandhi would welcome Japanese control if India were not 
given her freedom, I heard the following conversation by two 
elderly men who were discussing the news bulletins, "England 
will never win. She will not rule the world. It is in the 
Bible that she is not going to rule ever." The other elderly 
man made the following remark, "India will either rule or 
be ruined."
