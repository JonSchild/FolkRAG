-8- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15 New York 8-18-42

    New York 8-11: "There is no steel shortage. The big steel companies
are making up all that talk through their men in the Government, to keep the
price of steel up high. "

      Brooklyn 8-14 (Hardware dealer): "If the Government is serious
about the steel and metal shortage, then it can get all the stuff it needs
by going around and taking stuff off our hands, at cost. We wouldn't
kick." 

      New York 8-13 (Irish-American): "Henderson and those others
are letting all the birth control manufacturers use all the rubber they 
want. That proves the rubber shortage is phonery." 

  Inflation
       Troy 8-10 (Farmer): "Every time we farmers get enough money
somebody begins to yell 'inflation'. That's the way it's been since
Bryan's time. Id this is what they mean by inflation, just give me
a couple of hundred bushels." 
      
       Buffalo 8-11: "The cost of shoes and clothes have gone up
every week for months. Henderson and his pals blame it on inflation. 
If you want to know the truth, I'll tell you. Those ---  ---- Jews are 
to blame." 

       Yonkers 8-12: "Wait'll you see the wheelbarrows we'll have 
to use for pocketbooks when inflation comes, and I mean soon." 

          New York 8-12 (Stationer): "What is safe today? Money isn't
worth what it was and I believe it will be worth even less by 1943. 
That's inflation for you." 

          New York 8015 (Housewife): "Morgenthau has been given a secret
order by Roosevelt to print all the money he can without the people getting
wise. It will be like those German marks, good for wall paper." 

           New York 8-14: "Get your furniture now. Inflation will push
the prices up 100% in four months, My husband says."
