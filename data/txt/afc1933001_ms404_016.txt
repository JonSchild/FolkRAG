Extracts from RTL letters to family:
New Roads, Oct. 14 -- cont'd.
Did I write you about the 117 years old Negro in Jasper, Texas.  Dr. Jim out to meet him; he has a recipe for a bull-nettle tonic, got from an Indian; said tonic being guaranteed to restore lost manhood.  "I takes two doses ev'y two week".
Last night we went to a Negro Baptist meeting here, - the very worst ever I heard.  The preacher did not seem even to be sincere, just ranting for effect and for the collection.  Some Negro sermons thrill me, but this one horrified me.  There was only a handful of people present.  We passed the Negro Catholic Church; the street was crowded with cars and the whole place teeming with people... (Speaking of teeming, - yesterday John Avery told "Shack" that he mustn't have liquor on his breath when he came to our room to record.  "Shack" came in reeking with perfume:)  See cart "Shack"

New Roads, La. Cont'd:
We came to New Roads to hunt Negro French, Creole and Cajun, songs; also we hoped to find some cane-stripping and cane-cutting songs, but they are hard to get.  Cutting season is not yet on.  We have recorded a few jig songs and blues.  This town is located on "False River", part of the old Mississippi River bed.  There's plenty of fish caught but none offered to eat at the hotel or cafes.  We had to go eleven miles around the bend of the river to get fish to eat.  Nearly everybody here has a French name.  Noel LeBeau, who recorded for us at Shreveport, came from this place, and his best friend here is jimmy Boudreaux; both Noel and Jimmy are Negroes, singers of pretty little French creole songs.  We are about thirty miles from Baton Rouge, maybe farther, over the new bridge.  There is a sugar plantation near here where we hope to get at least some spirituals if not cane songs, -- the Alma Plantation.
