Dear Alan:
I call the two enclosed 
letters to your especial attention.
We should begin to be adamant
against the use of any of our 
copyrighted material except for cash
in hand or a contract with reliable 
firms. I shall not make 
any verbal or written agreements 
without first conferring with 
you. Do you also set 
your foot down.
*A little delay [must]
might make us money.
Lovingly,
Father
*Anyhow no agreement is morally
legal until we both agree
