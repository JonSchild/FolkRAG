[*[1942]*]                                            [*Rumors*]

Memo. dictated by Miss Berg over the phone
in reference to Rumor letters which you
sent over for Mr. Kane's signature.

                        It seems to me in light of the
work Rosten is doing in formulating a
policy on rumors, it will probably lead to
a public statement over Mr. Davis' name.
So, too, the memo itself should be held up
for a few more days, probably until the end
of the week for word from Rosten.
Then the report can be released with Mr.
Rosten's material without, I think, changing
the cover in this instance.


October 19th

I read this back to Miss Berg and it was
checked by her as o.k.
