PS. The machine seems now to me
to make excellent records.
We have it set for 78. Miss
Terrill, by matching levelling, vibration,
the depth of the cutting
and frequent needle replacement
has solved our difficulties. So
the nightmares of our troubles
is removed, thanks to her
intelligent patience. After all
these years the manufacturers in
this machine have evolved the
meanest to handle, start and stops
conglomeration of gadgets I have
ever worked with. Tell Mr.
Spivacke the good news.
Today I  ordered by wire, to have
sent here, more records and both sets
of needles.
Yours,
Father.
