Dear A. Lomax:

    I had expected to have been in Washington before this, but
I can't seem to arrange a time to come when the Library would be
open. Enclosed, therefore, is my formal request for you to come
up here.
    Unfortunately my idea for a speech at the Art Alliance in
conjunction with your visit did not work out, and I myself was the
chief nullifier when I learned conditions. The honorarium was all
right, but the Music Committee was broke, as was Literary Arts and
I did not want you to come under the auspices of any other committee.
It would not look as though they wanted you, for naturally the reason
could not be made public. My second reason for saying "No" was the
fact that too/many events were planned for February, March, and April
with the result that our audiences are not so large for any one event
as they should be. I have criticised the program for that, and do
not feel it would be at all fair to you to rush an appearance which I
believe should be carefully heralded. I hope that you forgive me
for all the trouble I have stirred up over this without success.
    And I want another favor. Can you or any other Lomax tell
me of any discussion of "James Bird" other than in the Ohio Archaelogical
Journal (1911 1915) and that reference I gave you in the "Wyoming Co.
Historical Society" publications? How about songsters? I want to
"Do a piece" on "James Bird" as a preliminary to the whole project, and have
gathered quite a bit of material, but wonder if there hasn't been a conclusive 
article been done. Will you tell me what you know, please? KD
