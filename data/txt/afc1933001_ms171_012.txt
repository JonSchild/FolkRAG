Dear Dr. Lomax:
I am enclosing a copy of a letter which we have received
from a young refugee student who is interned in Canada. His
name is Ernst Bornemann. Do you think it might be possible
for you to do anything in his behalf? We would appreciate
any suggestions you might have to make.
If you are interested and wish further information
please let me know.
Sincerely yours,
Josephine Lee
