(Nel) --gonna tell on you, Cass!
 
Woman:    You know that's all true!   (laughter)

AL:    Does everybody know about "On top of Old Smokey, all covered 
with snow, I lost my true lover for courtin' too slow?" 

Cass:    I guess Nell knows that.

Nell:    Yeah, I used to know it. . .

Woman:    You know it, Sheila. . .

Sheila:    I know -- just that one verse is all 

Nell:    I used to know it, but I ain't tried to sing it for 
so long. 

AL:    What about "Barbara Allen" Nell(Dell?),  you know that one? 

Nell:    No, I don't know all the words to "Barbara Allen." 

Woman:    (unint) 

Nell:    I seed her, I know she can't sing, she had her teeth pulled 
six times, put in new ones, she can't sing. 

AL:    What about "Early in the Spring?" 

Sheila:    Think granny knows that one. 

AL:    That's a real love song. 

Nell:    I can sing it if you want me to, yessir, could sing it. 
(tech.). . .  (sings): "(unint.) in the spring, as I said (unint) 
to serve my King, (unint. . .). . ." 

AL:    You think that's a true song?
 
Nell:    Yeah, it's an old one, too. I heard my mother sing that 
when I was just a little bitty thing.   I might not have sung it all,
