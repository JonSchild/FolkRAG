Father nor mother not at home,
To comfort them when sick they mourn.

When I go home and look around,
And recollect she can't be found,
Over my fields I seem to roam, 
Return and find no wife at home.

Now I will return all to my God,
Oh, Lord, my blood is shed abroad,
Who brought me through the troubled sea,
And wipe mine eyes eternally.

THE LITTLE BABE

The little babe is gone to rest,
To reign with God forever blest,
It's little tongue will always praise
A Savior's love, redeeming grace.

Far from a world of sin and strife,
It now enjoys a heavenly life,
And joins to praise and shout and sing,
And make the heavenly arches ring.

Could we but hear its little tongue,
So sweetly sing the heavenly song,
Could we but see its smiling face,
Delighted with the happy place.

We would not wish it back again,
But say, dear babe, with God remain,
We'll try to gain that peaceful shore,
Where those who meet shall part no more.

Now let us strive the prize to win,
Let's come to Christ--with him remain,
Then we shall share in Jesus' love,
And meet the little babe above.
