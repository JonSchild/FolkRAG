'BETRAYAL by RUMOR'

These photographs were taken during the making of a movie conceived and executed by the children in the Youthbuilders Club of Junior High School 73, Queens.  The student-actors above symbolize the theme of "Betrayal by Rumor" - the evil and injustice wrought by loose talk, especially in wartime.

A crucial early scene in the movie shows a student of German extraction reading a German book in the school library, while two fellow-students watch him suspiciously, and wonder, and get ideas.

A scene which takes place after the rumors started by the fellow-students have spread.  The teacher's back is turned, the German boy cowers in the aisle, innocent victim of his companions' war hysteria.

To point the moral of the tale the young movie-makers brought in Dr. Clyde Miller of Teachers College, whom they had previously consulted in their study of propaganda.  Dr. Miller plays the role of a chance acquaintance who brings the class timely advice.
