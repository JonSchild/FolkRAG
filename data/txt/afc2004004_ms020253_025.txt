BJ: Well, anyway, I went on back home. An' that was on a, a
Saturday evenin'. An so, an' that Monday, we got a room, a
place bigger place that we lived on at the house, like we ought
to. Then they did put up a kick.  They talked up a breeze 'round
there. "Oh, they ain't married; they ain't married." I said
"We are married."
     "No you ain't; no, no; no, no." They kep' right on. Didn't
tell me that, ya know. Tell the other folks that. 
     An' when I tell them that, they say, "Yeah?" But you go
off to the other folks, you know it ain't. 
   "Ohh, she in that church!" Maggie, she flew hard.  Said
she was comin' out of the church if I was in there not married.
All right. She went an', she had went an' married to Boy, had
been livin' with [her] 'im seven years.  She married to Boy, an' everybody get in the car.  She reached to get them papers.  Act
like they fall. "Oh good God, I can't drop this here; this precious; this, this..." Showin' it to everybody. "Ya see this, dontcha? Ya
see this?" Oww, make me sick!
     I said, "Good God!" That's so aggravatin' it's
crazy! Ha, ah! Don't never got married in seven years an'
so glad to show that I married 'im, I would be ashamed.  Tha's all.
I didn't say anything about that.  It wa'n't none of my business.
Not even when she be showin' me; I didn't say nothin'. 'Cause
she try to slander me, ya know; see was I gonna say, "Yeah,
I got mine, too."  I ain't told her nothin'.  George said, "Don't
tell 'er nothin'.  Jus' let her talk."  For the Bible says, "Speak
that you know.  And testify that you see." An' so, that was
his own folks, an' so I didn't say nothin'.  Never thought of it.
