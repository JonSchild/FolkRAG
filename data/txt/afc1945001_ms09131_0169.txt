1. Did you hear about the moron who broke his
arm in the bath tub trying to make a WAVE.

2. Instead of the guard house the boys at camps
are being given a WAAC and put to bed.

3. A Jew, a German, and an Italian were walking
down the street telling each other what
they would like to be after the war
was over. The German said he would 
like to be the commanding officer under
the Furer, the Italian said he wanted 
to be the same under Mussolini
then they both turned to the Jew and
said, "And I suppose you'd like to be
Jesus Christ," and the Jew answered,
"What's wrong with that, one of our
boys made the grade before, didn't 
he?"

4. Slogan for the navy: Join the navy and
ride the WAVES.
