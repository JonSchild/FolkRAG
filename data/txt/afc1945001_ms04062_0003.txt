"It isn't a good idea to jockey for a commission or a rating
in the Navy, and I'll tell you (listener) why.  In the first place, guys
at the recruiting station may promise you a rating or a commission, but
once you get in there, and they need seamen or deck-hands, the guys at the
top simply bust you down for one reason or another until you're a seaman
or a deck-hand.  And don't think they won't either.  Boy, they may tell
you you will be a CPO or an Ensign, but if they need galley slaves -
you'll be a galley slave, and don't think you won't."  (San Francisco,
August 4th.  Elderly grizzled ex-seaman (apparently.) [*3*]
