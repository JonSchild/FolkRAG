Christmas gifts for soldiers


Rumors have been reported to us from several places
in the United States to the effect that soldiers receiving
Christmas gifts from the folks at home will have to pay
elaborate import duties on receipt of the gifts in foreign
lands.

We also learn that the Army has made arrangements
for such gifts to be custom-free.

Publicity about the Army's Interest in Christmas
gifts and its efficiency in arranging customs immunity would,
it would seem, hearten Christmas donors at home.

I should think this might be referred to the
Deputy succeeding Paul Smith on Military information.
