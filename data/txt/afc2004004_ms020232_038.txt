BJ:     Oh, ah, yeah, I guess they did, around Ray, out there.
AL:    What was Ray?
BJ:     It's a town.  Lil' town.  'Bout 5 miles.
AL:    What was different about Ray than the places you were?
BJ:     Well, it's jus', we ain' jus' never heard talk a nobody aroun'
Osierfield donin' that.  Not, not, not right in there.  They might
did it, but we don't. . .it ain't. . .you know, they wasn't like they
used say about the Ray girls.  A lot of Ray girls.  Now, Osierfield,
where we was, wasn't nobody in that lil' part, over there,
in Thurman, but us.   You see?
AL:    What was the difference between Ray and the places you lived
in terms of the kind of people.
BJ:     Well, they, they jus' more religious peoples.   An' another
thing about it, there's a few.   You see?   They had three
churches there in Osierfield.  An' all around the settlement was
farmers, an' they had own wives an' own families an' everything
like that.  Ray had a lot of peoples comin' from Ambrose an'
Broxton an', you know, them girls an' things [comin'] come in there
an' stay with diffrunt ones an' they would just come down there
because they could meet them white boys an' colored boys that was
on these turpentine stills over from there, ya see.   That's the
diffrunt in Ray an', an' Osierfield.   Lot a diffrunt.   An' then
they, then they would meet the farm boys, far as that concerned,
see.   An' Ray wa'n' not, wa'n' no bigger'n Osierfield, but it's
jus'. . .Some of 'em around had stills an' then there was Broxton
an' Ambrose an' Amherst, an' all them lil', those lil', old places,
was, ah, you know, wasn't so far from there.  Hawdon, all like
that.   They would go through them places.
