     "Run heah, woman, got a pain in my haid;
      Doctor tole me to quit it, fore it killed me daid.
      Cocaine done killed my baby!"
(He now sings this verse out loud, warming to his work.  It's a very
familiar tune.)
     "Now you talk about yo baby, you ought see mine.
      She ain't so pretty, but she do jes fine.
     Cocaine all round my cradle!"
     (Me:  Mmmmmmm-hmmmmm!  That song really gets me.)
     I would git you, too, if I was long in my young days.
You'd howl like a puppy an growl like a cat.  Couldn't hep it.
     (Me:  Would you gnaw on me like a dog on a bone?)
     Mmm-hmmmm.  I would eat you up without a piece of bread.
     (Pat:  bursts into wild laughter)
     Eat you up widout a piece of bread.  What you
talkin bout!
     (Bernie:  That's sweet meat there.)
     If you want some sugar, gnaw one that's sweet enough.
Thass troof.  I'll eat you up.
     (Bernie:  Elizabeth is too plump for that.  They say 
the closer the bone, the sweeter the meat.)
     (I:  scornfully, Oh-ho!)
     Anythang I loves better than a woman, it must be
anoth er woman.  Th ass troof.  If God made anything better he kept
it in Heaven.  He didn't put it down heah.
     (Me:  He thinks that women don't like to make love.  He
thinks that woman just find it a pain.  Isn't that right, Rev?)
     Naw. . .That's the way you put it.  I didn't put it like
that.
     (Me:  I thought that's what you said.)
