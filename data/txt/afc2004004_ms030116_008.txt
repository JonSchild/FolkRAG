I went in a store in Greenville, South Carolina, on Burnich Street. I went into the company store to buy a sack of flour. I couldn't see the woman. She had eyes. She could see. She coulda got outa my way. The store-
keeper said, "By God, you're walkin up against that white woman." I jes
tell you troof I didn't know nothin I was so scared. I said, "Mister, I can't see."
"By God, you ought to be careful." Thass what he said.
I forgot what I come in that store to buy. I forgot I was hongry. I went home, thought I had done eat. I felt like I had come close to gittin killed. I stepped in theah to buy a sack of flour an I like to got killed.
Always buy my flour every Saturday. I like not to went to church less somebody would preach my funeral.
You say it's terrible. Well, you're one. You ain't got the strength and power. You want a dust of flour. "Well," you say, "I wisht I could let you have it, but I can't." Go to the man thass got a barrel of flour; he say, "Naw. I ain't gon let you have no flour." I say that as a parable.
I tell you, Sistah, what's the mattah. The wrong people has got the power.
They ain't gone have nobody in them seats that ain't smart enough to chisel you out of your share. (the Welfare of New York City). If they see
you can't chisel, they take you out an put in somebody ain't got no mercy.
You go from the Welfare to the top of the nation. What are we gonna do
when the head of the church is rotten? You got to kill de head befo the
whole can grow healthy again.
Thass what's making this war. Heads is rotten.
Rotten people's got the money guardin it. Thass what's makin so many
hoodlums.
I hope I ain't said enough to hang me.
