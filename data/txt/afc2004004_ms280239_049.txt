Lomax:  That's the way the men really felt ?
Strachan:  Oh yes.
Lomax: They were pretty independent these farm-servants. Would
they tell you to go to hell if they felt like it?
Strachan:  When I was [fee] a kid the goodman wouldna take their
money if they were falsit. You couldna fault him. You couldna pay
a man and fault him at the same time.  To hell with it, man, stick
it to your arse;  though it was only a pound, they wouldna hae it.
They didn't get big pay.
Lomax:  What did they make ?
Strachan:  When I began farming I heard my foreman got twelve
pounds a half a year - he was supposed to get haf the fee--
twelve pounds, but he was only fifteen, he wasna sixteen. Second
horseman gor nine a half year and thirteen a day, boys.
Lomax:  They worked hard didn't they ?
Strachan:  Oh no! They did - they worked fairly when you was
needing them, they fairly stuck into it, but they werena' pressed,
you know, like you would hear about.  Plenty of fun and frolic.
I mind in this lone diggings - it's an awful story this!  - aye, 
but steady working, you see - this lone digging's 's foreman, and
there was a son of the bailey - a loon - a cattleman - wecalled
him the bailey - loon, and him and this loon Wilson was a long
time shifting - but this man was coming up to the weatherside a 
mile or a trifle near, hoeing turnips, and who had by far the
biggest John Thomas -- and there was the worst row you ever did
hear in these diggings; and he was a plougher and he had a measure
in his pouch, andin the digging we had to measure these taw lads. 
And if you'd seen either ain standing, of course -- and we put
the edge of the rule against his belly -- that made him a lot
longer, you see.

Robin Hood - John Strachan (40secs)
1) When Robin Hood was about twenty years old
    He happened to meet Little John,
    A JOlly brisk blade just fit for the trade,
    And he was a sturdy young man.

2) They happened to meet in Nottingham bridge,
    And neither of them would give way,
    Quoth brave Robin Hood, in right merry mood,
    "I'll show you right Nottingham play."

3) Robin led on sae thick and sae hard,
    He made little John to admire,
    And every knock, it made his little bones smoke,
    As if he had been in a fire
