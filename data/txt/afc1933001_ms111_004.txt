Dear Elizabeth:

I am shipping some 40 odd discs of Negro sermons, 
singing, etc. to Alan c/o Recording Laboratory, Library 
of Congress, express collect. I hope that they will be
duplicated and returned as per our arrangements. 

I am very badly in need of recording discs and cutting 
needles. In fact, unless I receive some pretty 
soon from the Library of Congress, my work is going to be 
slowed up considerably. If you can ship me some of same
I would be obliged to you.

I should also appreciate comments on the recordings
that I made from the Library recording experts. There
are many flaws, I know, in my recordings. Please
place the duplicates that you have made where they will
be of most use to anyone who might be interested in them. 

This is a copy of a letter sent to Alan at the 
Library. I am sending you one because I am really badly
in need of the above mentioned materials and I thought
that if Alan were gone, you could take care of it for
me. 

Yours Truly,
Johnie
