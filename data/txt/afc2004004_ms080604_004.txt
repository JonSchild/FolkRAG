even if you can't drive 'em.  The (corral?) man (Hancourt?),
who used to harness my mules, cos I didn't know one mule from 
another.  You supposed to know your team. . .didn't know one
team from another.  I used to catch another man's team and
harness it for mine.  At least the (corral?) man did --till I 
got big enough.   When I got big enough, well then, I'd just
harness my own mules.   I used to tie a string on they tails to
tell my mule from his mule! (laughs).   They come out in the
morning tryin to find they mules, and I got 'em already 
harnessed, got them all harnessed, allright.   Hook him up, and
haul on out there, haul that man some dirt.   Come back in.  You
know, when I was in (front of them?)  I wasn't big enough to
put all them harness on 'em, you know, but then I learned!
Oh, I was a cat then. . .
A.L.:
How old were you?
W.S.H.:
Oh, I was bout eighteen then.  I was a man 
then.   I thought I was, anyway.   So, I lived camp from 1919 to
'35.   Stayed up the levee camp then.   Then we come out, and we
built that levee down there (points ahead--pauses for passing
vehicle--begins again:)   Then we come out, and we put that
hump in down there.  Then from the Chicago Mill on down.  And
all up here at Scott's, we built all that levee up there.
A.L.:
How high was the levee?
W.S.H.:
Oh it was as high as that (nods head towards the levee in front of them).
Another man (off cam., probably W. Brown):
No!
W.S.H.:
Lotta places. . .
Another man:
No!
W.S.H.:
Then a lotta times we made it bigger, you
know, like that. . .road banked 'em.  That's what it was. . .
A.L.:
See, people don't know what we're talkin about
--that are listening to you.  They don't know anything about
why the levee was put down, who was organized to do it, and
how long it took to make it, --tell us all about that.
