Mr. Alan Lomax - Page 2

I received a letter from Mr. G. P. Putnam the day after I returned
asking for the records. We sent them all to him immediately. You
missed the possibilities of this connection, judging by your note to
me. Remember that he is a reputable publisher who has been faced with
copyright restriction before and is probably used to paying for permission
to use material.

There was a little mixup with Droops in connection with a phonograph
repair which they claim you ordered. Mr. Bond is on vacation,
Mr. Dumain would assume no responsibility and no one in the Music Division
knew anything about it, so the man had to be sent back empty-
handed. Please send me a memo about it if you want anything done.

I was disappointed to find no report awaiting me on my return.
Since this is official business, you are hereby ordered to remain wherever
you are and to devote all your time to the completion of your report.
When finished, sent it to me immediately and resume your trip. This is
important as the Annual Report must be submitted by August 31!

Enclosed you will find stationary and franked envelopes. 

Best regards!

Sincerely, 

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music

P.S. I have been unable to contact Miss Meyer. Do you know where I can
reach her?
