When Pentecost had fully come,
And fire from heaven did fall,
The Holy Ghost as mighty wind
Baptized them one and all.
Three thousand souls converted then,
Were soldiers right away,
And the God that reigned at Pentecost
Is just the same today.--Chorus.

No. 7

THE NINETY AND NINE

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold,
But one was out on the hills away,
Far off from the gates of gold,
Away on the mountains wild and bare
Away from the tender Shepherd's
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

Lord thou hast thy ninety and nine,
Are they not enough for thee?
But the Shepherd replied,
"This one of mine has wandered away from me;
The way may be rough, wild and steep,
I go to the desert to find my sheep,
I go to the desert to find my sheep.

But none of the ransomed ever knew
How deep were the waters crossed;
Now how dark was the night that the Lord passed
through
Ere he found the sheep that was lost,
Away in the desert he heard its cry,
So feeble and helpless and ready to die,
So feeble and helpless and ready to die,

Lord whence are those good-drops all the way
That mark out the mountain's track?
They were shed for one who had gone astray
