not that way.
AL: No.
[*(Poverty & Theft)*]
BJ: No, no. Some of 'em really would gi' you enough to go on,
as, as, as I tell the folks around St. Simon, I say, "I'm satisfied
a one thing: They pays us enough to keep from stealin'." An'
so.      a lot of 'em'll sho' will give[s] 'em enough
to keep from stealin'. An' some of 'em, you know, an' don't have
to go takin'.
     An' a lot of them colored peoples, ah, ah, I know, ah, I
heard talk of an' know one, one one or two, say they not gonna

They tol' em, "You. . . .When ya git some work [, you] to do, you come back an'

     "You let him come in to take that?"
     He said, "Well, I see he was hongry; I see he meant it. He, he
was hongry. So I let 'im have it." And then they'll dominize the
