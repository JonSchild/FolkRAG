BJ TAPE 27, p. 17 

You know?, what's, what's buried. If they give it to you, you 
can have it, see?  [An' he] Peter said he walked on down there. Goin'
down there.  Said he said, "That 'coon will show ya directly
where it's at."  Say, "You dig it up."  Peter say he walked on
down there. Say when he got just about to the tree, said this
'coon -- looked like [about] almost big as a half calf -- say he never
seen such a 'coon in his life, but it's a 'coon.  Said -- you
know, wasn't a real 'coon, but he's shaped as a 'coon.  Say he
just went right straight down on, on the ground. And just van-
ished away. Right there. See?
Peter say [said] he stood there an' looked.  An' said, he say,
"I, I couldn't dig money, but I couldn't dig up that 'coon."
Just 'cause he went away right there, ya see?  An', he just
couldn't . . .!  His nerve failed ['im] see?
So he went on back, to the house. An' John an' them asked
him what -- an' so he tol' John an' them.  John had come out.
Told 'em just what it was an' they went an' looked an' said
was a great, big sink around in, in the ground, sure -- just
like sumpin' was sunk down in a whole.  You know, wasn' ah,
it, it wasn't dug out or nothin', just a sink, you know, what
you see in the groun'?  Jus' a hole;  jus' a sink.  Said jus' like
he say.  Said they say, "Well," said "Here, [Gi'] it to me," said, "I'll
dig it.  If you gi' it to me I'll dig it."
Peter said"He tol' me to dig it."  Said, "I can't dig with
that 'coon.  That 'coon went right down, down in that lil' sink
an' didn', an' didn't come out!"  Hah! "So I ain't gonna dig 'im up!"
He was afraid.  He was scared he couldn't work, hardly, that day.
The nerve failed.  He went all the way through that, an' then
got there an' couldn't make it!
