thing there, ya know, then sweep the ashes on it?  Her name was

ain't married.  Morris stay on the old place an' she, she stays

AL:     Were they very rich white people?
BJ:      Very rich.  By the name of Flement.  An' he used to holler
to ya, to wake up his hands.  [Sh' -] Sho't , fat white man.  Used
just' get out an' holler, like, like I do -- not like Bob, jus' holler, jus'
holler:  Eeeeeeee.   Jus' holler that way.  He wake 'em up, too.
Ha, ha.  Go by Amos Flement.  I see some of the boys is [sil] still
livin.  Lee is dead.
AL:     He has a big cotton [field there] plantation?
BJ:      Big cotton field, um-hum.  Have farmers, ya know.
AL:     Does he have, does he rent or just have hired men?
BJ:      They have plenty hired hands and have sharecroppers, ya know.  And
den a few big shots, they call it, they rents.  See?  My uncle
was a renter, always.  He never did anything but rent.  They
call him a big shot.  An' they many more around there -- the
Joneses, some of 'em; they wasn' these Jones, what I'm in, but
I suppose, but they Joneses; they used to rent.  That's the big
shots, colored folks would call it, ya know.  Rents.  Leased
it, they call it, ya know.  Like that.
AL:     Did the white people treat the big shots different than they
treated the field hands, or did everybody. . .?
BJ:     Not to my knowin'.
