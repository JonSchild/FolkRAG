Mr. John A. Lomax
Port Aransas, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

    I was very pleased to see all the letters, which are being re-
turned under separate cover, but I must confess that I am somewhat
a little surprised at your response for sending them to me. I repeat,
perhaps for the last time, that I have absolute confidence in you.
This confidence, aside from my personal feelings in the matter, is
based on my simple belief that you and your son are the finest folk
song collectors in this country. This has been my opinion for some
time and nothing has happened to make me change it. I am still work-
ing on the schedule in the few spare moments that I have, and hope to
have it very soon.

    Adrian Dornbush asked me today to help locate a small group
of cowboy singers numbering from three to six who combine "authenticity"
with an ability to entertain. This is for a gathering in Washington
in June in which Mrs. Roosevelt is interested and which I believe she
will attend. The expenses of the singers to and from Washington will,
of course, be paid. I thought perhaps that you would be in a position
to recommend a suitable group. Will you please let me know by air
mail whether or not there are such singers in all of Texas?

    With kindest regards,
    Sincerely yours,
    Harold Spivacke
    Chief, Division of Music
