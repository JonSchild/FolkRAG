Dear Ed:

You remember that in our conversation with Clapp we
arranged for Jerry to make a consultation advance to
Vance Randolph when he came to Knoxville. He has
decided not to come and we are shipping him the
machine. I would greatly appreciate your taking the
matter up with Clapp and asking him how the first
payment of $100 or $200, preferably at the end of the
first two weeks, might well be made. Vance should
have begun work by August 1.

Don't forget our mail. It is hotter than Hades here.

Best wishes,

Sincerely,
Alan Lomax

of General Delivery, Blairsville, Georgia.
