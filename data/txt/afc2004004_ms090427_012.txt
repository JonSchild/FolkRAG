Part III -- The Highway

Highway development was slow in Mississippi, being gravelled
roads which were called "the good road."  The main highways followed
the railroads closely, usually running parallel.  The tributary roads 
leading into the main thoroughfares were not well developed, and many
of them were not all-weather roads, but in the dry season at least 
they permitted greater freedom of movement than the railroad.  The early 
twenties saw the collapse of the cotton boom, the closing of the red
light district, and trouble for the middle class.  When the concrete
highway came, in the thirties, it went across the country with little
regard for the railroad and railroad towns.  The movement of people
was less restrained than when they were dependent upon the railroad.
The filling station followed the railroad station as the railroad station
had followed the steamboat landing.
The era of the highway is that of motor driven machinery and 
the economy rapidly reflected the change.  Following the depression, 
the flat extensive fields lent themselves to tractor cultivation.  The
introduction of motor driven machinery further changed the plantation
system.  The folk skills and folk knowledge of soil and plant and animal
became unimportant with scientific cultivation.  The transition is
not complete, and the economy is complicated with the varying degrees
of traditional form and practice in cotton production just as a variety
of roads lead into the concrete highway -- hard surface, gravel, and 
dirt.
Socially, the organization of the area is also complicated.
The complexity is to be seen i the variety of plantation workers and
