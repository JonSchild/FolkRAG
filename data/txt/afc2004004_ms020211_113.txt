Dear John, 
Your letter finds me well and I hope this finds you the 
same. Anne has gone back to school and is a lot happier.
 I am working very long hours and every weekend at the 
office, and we're both so busy that we scarcely see each 
other. Anne tells me that it's much the best situation 
between fathers and nineteen-year-old daughters and I 
imagine that a man of your experience would probably agree 
with her rather than with me.

The world keeps on singing more and more folk songs and 
why nobody asks for you all to sing I don't know, because 
your music is the best thing around America today. I 
have been too busy to write any letters about the group 
lately but in December I am going to get to work on it 
and get you some work. It's simply crazy that you're not 
traveling and singing, not so much for your sake as for 
the sake of your audience. 

Please give Bessie, Emma, Peter and everybody love from
Anne Blueberry and myself. We think of you often and 
wish we were with you.

Much much love,
