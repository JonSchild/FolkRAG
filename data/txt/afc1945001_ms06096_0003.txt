Criticism of Government efficiency is heard, particularly 
regarding the war effort. Stories are current that, "there really 
isn't much fog in the Aleutian Islands, and even if there is, the 
Japs should have as much trouble as the United States." This is 
a very general opinion which has been expressed by a banker, a 
college professor, a retired British Army officer and a clerk in 
a local store within the past ten days.   [*Los Angeles   3*]
