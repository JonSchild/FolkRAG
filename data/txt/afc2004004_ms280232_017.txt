4) But gin I saw his face again
The hounds they hunted o'er the plain,
Then ilka ane should get his ane
And ilka whig the mell.
5) O for a bank as long as crail
And for the rape that rapes a whale,
We'll hang the tykes up by the tail
AND HEAR THE TYKES YELL.

The Whigs of Fife is typical of all the many scurrilous songs
that were circulating in the countryside about the traitors
and the merchant class generally that were siding with the
Hanoverian King against the old Stewart line. There must have
been hundreds and hundreds of these songs. Tjis os one of the
best that have come down to us, but in the verse, "But gin I saw
his face again" the man referred to is James the 3rd, or King
James 8th as the Scots used to call him - the old Pretender -
the Stuart king that arrived in Scotland for about a month before
he went across the sea again at the defeat at Sheriffmuir - the
indecisive battle of Sheriffmuir.
This song is one of the Jacobite songs of the border - the
Galoway countryside. . .
1) Kenmuir's on and awa', Willie, (2)
And Kenmuir's Lords the greatest Lord
That ever Galloway saw.
Success to Kenmuir's band, Willie, (2)
There's no a lad that fears a whig
That rides by Kenmuir's hand.
2) There's a rose in Kenmuir's cap, Willy, (2)
He'll steep it red in ruddy heart's bleed
Afore the battle drap.
For Kenmuir's lads are men, Willy, (2)
Their hearts and swords are metal
And that their hearts shall ken.
3) They'll live and die wi' fame, Willy. (2)
And soon's we sound the victory may Kenmuir's lads come home.
Here's Kenmuir's health in wine, (2)
There's never a coward of Kenmuir's blood, nor yet of Gordon's line.

Now there are two or three songs of the Jacobite period of a bit
later - '45 - the Rising in the Highlands and the Prince - Bonnie
Prince Charlie. The first is one that Burns rewrote, and as a
Burns version is pretty famous, first I'll show you how the old 
version is different from it.
