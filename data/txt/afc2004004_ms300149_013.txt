Dear Alan,
            rec. your sweet father several weeks
ago, I am so sorry have been so long about
writing you, but have been working very
hard. and my son and family from
Minot North Dakota. Picked this time to
visit. am staying home. and working 
days. that is am giving bed side care
for 10 hrs a day to one patient. so have to
do all the work at home after 6 PM. leave
at 8 A.M. am trying to write this on
the job and suppose the old man will
want at least 14 things while I am
writing. thanks for all you are doing and
trying to do for me. this patient is in his
own home and one thing he loves is for me
to sing [him] to him instead of reading., so
get some Practice on my old Balads that
way. he is 85 and loves the old songs
almost as well as I.  ( I think no one I have
Met is quite so fond of the old folk lore
and songs. (over)
