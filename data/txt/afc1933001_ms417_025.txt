Throughout this book, as you'll see, we've been trying
to tell, wherever possible, about who wrote the song, where,
when, and why. But more often than not the origins of these songs
have just been teetotally lost, or else passed through so many
hands you couldn't rightly tell where it began. So in a lot
of cases we're just telling you where we picked it up, and let it
go at that.
Besides, who's to say who "composed" a song? The very best
songs in the whole world haven't been made up by one man, but
have passed through many hands, with a little added here, or 
added there, or changed. So after a while all the corners are 
smoothed off, and it's really simple, and really beautiful.
