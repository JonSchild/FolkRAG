MEMBERS OF THE GEORGIA SEA ISLAND GROUP
My dear Friends:
Do you remember the film that Bess Hawes and Edmund Carpernter made of the 
Group in Los Angeles some years ago? We have had a hard time finding a 
distributor who would handle it because it was so specialized. We have now 
found someone as follows:
Mr. Art Brown Telephone: (312) 386-4826
Film Images
1064 Lake Street
Oak Park, Illinois 60301
They are going to get the film out to the public. All the royalties are going 
to the Group and will be divided equally among its members:
Bessie Jones
Peter Davis : 1617 Lee Street, Brunswick, Georgia
Sister Ramsey - Heir of Henry Morrison: Harrington Settlement, Route 4 Box 8 
St. Simon's Island, Ga. 31522
Heir of John Davis: Beulah Wing, Harrington Settlement, Box 91
St. Simon's Island, Georgia, 31522
Emma Ramsay
Mable Hillary
Each of you will receive an accounting directly from the film company every 
six months, stating how many copies of the film have been sold and telling you 
what your royalties will be.
You must not expect a great deal of money form this because films like this 
do not play in movie theaters. Usually they go out to schools. However, there 
will be some income for each one of you. Nether Ted Carpernter, Bess Hawes
nor myself want to derive any financial benefit from this.
All the best regards, I remain
Yours affectionately,
Alan Lomax
