Mississippi Folk Songs. Arthur Palmer Hudson, The University of
North Carolina Press, 1936.

Although Professor Hudson's volume, the most recent in the series
of regional studies of the Anglo-American ballad tradition,
points the way toward a fruitful method for the student of folk-song,
it scarcely answers the demands of this suggested method.
The editor seems to share the widespread belief that a collection
of folk-songs must be something more than a group of texts with
a bit of pretty writing as an introduction. It is now quite obvious
that numerous English ballads were preserved in this country --
the exact number can only be of interest to the antiquarian --
and anyone who has studied the large, scholarly collections
can find out how they have been preserved on this side of the Atlantic.
Thousands of pages of song manuscript have been accumulated
by libraries and by interested persons, but relatively little
has been done with this material in the way of analysis or interpretation.
The conscientious editor feels that at least he must
give his songs reality by discussing their social context and
their role in that context.

This problem Professor Hudson attacks in the first portion of his 
book. He treats in turn of the national and regional derivation
of the settlers of Mississippi, the institutions of the period before
1860 and the folk-ways of several communities in which ballads
have been recently discovered. From the very earliest days
