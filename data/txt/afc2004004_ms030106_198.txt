I was so anxious to get away from Chicago.  I told him okay I would 
take the job and this is how I happened to be in Los Angeles, Calif. at
the Cadillac Cafe.
     They previously had a band playing there, when I went to the Cadillac.
This band was named the Black and Tan Band - that's the name they had
taken.  They had no fame at all.  It was a band consisting of four pieces,
trumpet, trombone, drums and piano - but they didn't have a regular
piano player - they'd pick up anybody that could halfway do.
     When I went to L.A., they taken the job away from these boys and
they also had a brass band to meet me at the station.  I'm telling you
it as a funny situation.  I had a lotta clothes those days, but the suit
I had chosen was a  blue suit to travel - went over the Santa Fe Road -
it happened to be in the summer time and God the dust was terrible
and this blue serge suit, by riding in the tourist car, the dust
could get in there just as it seen fit -
     I was almost as dusty as the boll weevil when I got to Los Angeles
with a big brass band to meet me at the station.  When I got off with all
that dust, immediately the newcomers that didn't know me wanted to know
was that the hot Jelly Roll they was talking about.  Said "The first
thing this guy needs to do is go to the cleaners," says, "He's got a dirty
suit of clothes on."
     And it was a fact - it was terribly dirty, but it was a new suit and 
it was swell when I left Chicago.  Well, anyway, I thought my trunks would
be there that night because I had to start to work that very night, but,
instead of my trunks coming, it was delayed for 3 or 4 days and I had to
wear the same suit and they was sure that I didn't have anything all
and was under a very, very tough criticism from the beginning.
