3. My godmother in Los Angeles told me this story about what happened
to a friend of her next-door neighbor. It seems that she was 
notified that her son had been killed at Pearl Harbor. Then several
weeks later the Government informed her that her son had not been
killed but had been wounded. Then just a few weeks ago she was
notified to meet a certain train on which her son would arrive. 
She and her daughter met the train but the son did not get off; 
they waited a short time not knowing what to do and were finally
approached by an officer who took them to an ambulance in which was 
the son. He had lost both arms and both legs in the Pearl Harbor 
bombing. He was taken home and a week later the mother lost her
mind and is now in a California insane asylum. (Housewife, about
26 years of age, comfortable circumstances. Phoenix, 8-6-42.) [*2*]
