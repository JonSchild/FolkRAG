Philadelphia, Pa.
Dear Kay:
I was delighted to hear from you, and many thanks for your
contacts. They will be put into our files to be used sometime perhaps.
We are so busy now, in so many different directions, it is beginning to
seem fantastic to record just one person.
I would like to hear what you are doing with your Irish, English
and Scotch background songs in Philadelphia. Are there any that need
recording, this time by a good recording machine.
Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax
