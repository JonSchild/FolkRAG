[*first verse*]

De Kalb blues, babe, make me feel so bad, (2)
Just to think about de times, babe, I once have had.

When' for the powder an' de straightenin' comb, (2)
Lawd, de De Kalb wimmen, Lawd, dey would not have no home.

Wasn' for de powder an' de sto'-bought hair, (2)
Lawd, de De Kalb wimmen would not go no-where.

Buy me a pistol, get me a Gat'lin' gun, (2)
If I catch you, babe, we gonna have some fun.

Some folks told me De Kalb blues wasn' bad, (2)
Wust ol' blues, Lawd, I ever had.

Looky here, baby, see what you tole me, (2)
I'm down in mind, trouble do I see.

Blues was whiskey, stay drunk all de time, (2)
Stay drunk, baby, to git you off my mind.

Feelin' bad, babe, jump overboard an' drown, (2)
Thinkin 'bout my woman, she done left this town.

Jumped in de river an' I started to drown, (2)
Thought about my woman an' I turned around.

Looky here, baby, what more can I do?
Looky here, woman, what more can I do?
Had five dollars an' I give you two.

Some folks told me the De Kalb blues wasn' bad, (2)
Wussest ol' blues, babe, I ever had.
