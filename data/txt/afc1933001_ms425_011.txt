COOPERATION IS OUR AIM

(Tune: There is a Tavern in the Town)

Cooperation is our aim is our aim.
We know through that, we'll surely gain, surely gain
Our rights as m[e]n, who till the fertile soil,
And feed the hungry of the land.

CHORUS:

Come on farmers, don't you tarry,
For we need Tom, Dick, and Harry,
To help us fight [the] unjust laws we taken, must take
Organize, oh, organize the Juniors too.
There's plenty work for all to do, all to do,
So start right in, there is no time to lose,
Organize! Organize! Otganize!

CO-OPERATE

(Tune: Some Think the World is Made FOR FUN AND FROLIC)

Some think it fine to be co-operators
And so do we, and so do we
Some think it wrong to buy from private merchants
And you can see, as you can see.
But we, we spend out time to help and build
Our Co-op Store, our Co-op Store
And spread the word about our Co-op Guild
Forevermore, forevermore
Listen, listen echoies sound afar
Listen, listen, echoes sound afar
Co-operation is the thing. Co-operate!
Echoes sound afar. Co-operate! Co-operate!

A CENTURY OF PROGRESS

A hundred years ago today,
With wilderness here,
With power in his gun, the man
Went hunting for the deer.

But now the sport is somewhat changed,
And on a New Deal plan;
With powder on her cheeks, the dear
Goes out and hets the man.
