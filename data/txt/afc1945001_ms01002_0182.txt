MEMORANDUM

TO:                          Mr. R. Keith Kane
                                 Assistant Director

FROM:                     Eugene Katz,
                                 Chief, Special Services

RE:                            RUMOR


            This does have special area connotations and points up
the need for intelligent rumor analysis. Whether the suggested plan
would work out for us ethnic as well as geographic groups to
worry about, I doubt. But, I am sure that it would be helpful to
the Naval Centers where special Naval rumors can do so much harm.

            Will Stevens, Managing Editor, Vallejo Morning Times-Herald
is the kind of guy we could use in Special Services Division.
