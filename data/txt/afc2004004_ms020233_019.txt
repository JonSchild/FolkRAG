BJ TAPE 19, p. 17

TL: When you take your first cut, do you take the vein out
then?
BJ: No, you, you take it, tha's [when you] all [you] the way through.
'Cause it's comin' out there, see, it goes on in the [water] wash. S--
The water's runnin' under it, all the time.  An' you put it, it
in your pan anyway.  You have to take -- Then if you sit there an'
takin' time with that one s'rimp all the time, you won't get
nothin' done.
TL: All you do then is cut it?  Period?
BJ: That's all.  An' jus', jus'...
TL: And throw it in water?
BJ: Tha's [right] all.  Jus' put it...Jus' let it go.  Yeah...
Sometime the tail comes of an' sometimes it don't, but you...
Them big ones, you see, it's not easy to git off.  You know?  Nohow.
An' ah...you...mos'ly use small ones for cocktails, anyway.  For
cocktail s'rimp.
An' then they used to weigh 'em up, you know.  They would
weigh 'em up then an' how much you picked.  [Ah] How, how many you
clean, you know, you, jus' how many pounds you git, you know.  An' you, [you,]
you gittin' paid by the pound at that time.  But now they gittin'
paid by the hour, see?  It's much better.  But they still weighin'
up, so they must undoubtedly be sneakin' in the pounds right, right
on, on 'em.  They claim they have to weigh 'em up to see how many
they, they pick a day.  They don' have that to do; they know how
many they pick by the boxes.  That's nonsense.  An' tell us about
everybody.  Everybody know better'n that.  They weighed 'em up
because there was a time, they tell me -- I don't work there; I
ain't worked there since I was sick.  But ah, there was a time,
they say that they would, ah, come an' tell the people, "Well,
she don't pick enough to, to be paid by the day."
