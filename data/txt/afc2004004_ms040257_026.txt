L.     Was she always singing?
Always at the spinning wheel.  But I don't [remember] mind.
She used to sing to put me to sleep.
I was the last of the family and the other sisters and brothers
got married except the brother that is with me just now.
I stayed with her and she didn't want me to marry and I am
not sorry.  She said I would not want and that I would
always have a happy life and I have that right up
until today with people coming and going to see me here
from America and from Ireland.

L.     Sing one of her spinning songs, Mary
