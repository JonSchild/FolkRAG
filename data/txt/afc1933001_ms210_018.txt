far more influential than precept.
I say this with special reference
to your Washington sojourn
with her. Needlessly late hours,
exposure to cold, etc. will
come very easily to your
life there. If you could
bring yourself to tuck her in
bed at a reasonable hour
every night, to see that she wears
rubbers when it is sloppy,
to insist that she is clad
warmly with neck protected
when it is very cold
(and exhibit yourself as taking
these precautions!), you could
see more immediate results
than will follow reams of
writing or long spoken polemics.
