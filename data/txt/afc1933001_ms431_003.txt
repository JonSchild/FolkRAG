HOLD THE FORT
(Tune: Hymn of the same name)

We meet today in freedom's cause,
And raise our voices high,
We'll join our hands in union strong,
To battle or to die.

Chorus:
Hold the fort, for we are coming,
Union men, be strong!
Side by side we'll battle onward,
Victory will come.

2.
See our numbers still increasing,
Hear the bugle blow.
By our union we shall triumph,
Over every foe.
     (Chorus)
3.
Fierce and long the battle rages,
But we will not fear;
Help will come whenever needed,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer.
     (Chorus)

SOLIDARITY
(Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic)

When the Union's inspiration through the Workers' blood
          shall run.
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun,
   Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength
          of one,
But the Union makes us strong.

Chorus:
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
Solidarity forever!
For the Union makes us strong.

2.
In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded
          gold,
Greater than the might of armies magnified a thousand-fold.
We can bring to birth the new world from the ashes of the old
For the Union makes us strong.
      (Chorus)
