Bureau of Public Inquiries
Jacksonville, Florida
Inter-Office Memorandum
[Office of Government Reports]

To: Chief, BPI                                    Date: 10/10/42
From: Florida Office
Subject: Rumor Report

As explained yesterday in special response to Mr.
Webber's inquiry concerning handling of rumors, it may not
have been impossible to have conducted this work as suggested,
but certainly it would have been exceedingly difficult.

It is a matter upon which the general public is
informed only in a very broad fashion, although Readers Digest
and Life magazine this week certainly have been most effective
in educational help.

This has not been done at all in the way you wished, 
but the material gathered is submitted without comment or alibi.
