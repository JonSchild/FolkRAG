GARY: 
White people, going in the war, you go in the war 
you understand they let you alone 
You don't pay no attention. Another thing a white man hates 
is they get a Negro who startin to running. They don't 
like to run at him you understand. The thing to do don't run 
down there, if you run they'll kill you. You know he gonna 
run, you understand. Kill the man, he starting to run. That 
man don't need to say, he gonna kill the man, he straight 
out starting to run. The fella start to run so much you 
understand. He know the white folk gonna catch him. He 
say to the whitefolks. "Whitefolks, you all know, I got the 
to make it running, and you know I ain't gonna do nothing 
run now why do you want to shoot" and He says Well I'm here 
I'm going to shoot you, cause its a wicked world, ain't going 
to shoot you unless you run, cause he ain't going to hit you 
you understand. I don't care how good you are you ain't going 
to hit him. You all, I tell what you all can do, you all make
[arrangements] a ring around me, like I'm in a circle. Then let 
me run around here, and show you how I feel. 
LARRY:
