New York, New York

Dear Mrs. Comhaire:

          I am delighted to hear that you have been granted a Guggenheim fellowship. Of course, that is much better than the Rosenwald and will give you much more freedom to do what you wish to do. Perhaps you might plan to ask for an extension for next year to do the job we discussed in Louisiana.

          Now that I am out of the Library, I'll tell you that I did my best to get the set of records sent to you cost free, but discovered that that is entirely against Library policy. I hope that they were what you wanted and that you will find you can use them.

          In the meantime, allow me to express my appreciation of your good work for the Archive and the hope that after the war, we can work out further plans for you work in Haiti, in cooperation with the Library.

          I am sorry to have missed your lecture in New York. I got there about an hour late. Everyone was enthusiastic in their reports of it, you will be glad to know.

                                                                         Sincerely yours,


                                                                         Alan Lomax, Information Specialist
                                                                         Bureau of Special Operations
