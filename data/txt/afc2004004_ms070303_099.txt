(Get saying for this - she'll remember)
The men were ever went out at sea,
foraging for food, in the hunt.  Ooh aye. 
The island men have been accused of 
being lazy, but this is men were 
out at sea or out on the moor for 
15 hours a day & everything that 
pertained to the home fell on the 
women. [The boat song of last 
night -- was not pirate - but 
simply a fisherman waiting for 
evening tide.]
In my mother's family 5 of 
her brothers were drowned, but 
wasn't usual -
& she had a holy hor of me bts ever 
after that.
