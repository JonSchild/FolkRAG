Monday--

Dear Alan:

Just a hurried note to thank you for the proofs, and to tell
you that they have been relayed promptly to Levine and his boys. I have
no idea how many of your corrections---particularly the ones in the
bibliography---can be made. Many of them, of course, were taken
care of by Stew Ayre's own proof-reading.

The only thing, apparently, of importance about which you and
I differ is the singing of "Adelita" in Spanish. I had at first assumed---
without thinking---that we would sing it and "En Roulant ma Boule"
in the original tongues. Whereupon, Gus Wiebe, quite rightly, sent me a
long telegram pointing out how mistaken this idea was from the teachers'
and kids' point of view. Most of them don't know these foreign
languages, and teaching them what would seem like nonsense syllables
would be embarrassing for the teachers and meaningless for the kids. I
have no objection to your singing these songs first in their original
tongues and then in English; but you can't expect the kids to do both. We
wanted to print the Spanish of "Adelita" also, but space didn't permit.

Levine tells me that the music is being duly forwarded to
the Seegers. As for your "severity", it's too hot to fight; and furthermore
I'm up to my ears in more immediate fisticuffs!  Hope you finally got
that mysterious check.

Love and kisses,
Bill
