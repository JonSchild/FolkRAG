I've been trying to get into the army or navy finance department, but the
navy won't take me because I don't have a college degree, and the army says
I've got to start as a buck private.  Why, I'm over 40, and would make a
heck of a combat soldier.  I've had many years of experience in a bank.  I
don't see why they can't use me where I'm best fitted.  I guess I don't
know what strings to pull.  -- Milwaukee, August 4  [*23*]
