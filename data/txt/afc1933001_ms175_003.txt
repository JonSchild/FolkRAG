MEMORANDUM 
FROM Alan Lomax Division TO THE CHIEF OF THE Music DIVISION
October 10, 1941 

This is a letter which was written before our armistice declared 
in September. I thought you might be interested in thinking about 
it. I have not yet answered Miss Colcord's last letter. She is one 
of the Archives best friends, and constantly sends me collector's 
items. 
Respectfully yours, 
Alan Lomax 
Alan Lomax 
Assistant in Charge 
ALjs 
I already saw this- thank you
H. S.
