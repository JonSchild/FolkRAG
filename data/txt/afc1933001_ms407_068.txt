Ballad of a Ballad-Singer


"An' if so be I might request -
Put that song on a roll,
An' let the Governor hear it
So he may save my soul!"
And they made a record of his petition
And pardoned him on that condition.


And Lead Belly came to Lomax
In the fall, as it befell,
When he was sitting in the lobby
Of a Texas hotel.
With knife, guitar, and sugar bag packed,
Lead Belly stood there, for a fact.


And all the words that he did say
Were: "Boss, here I is."
So Lomax took him to his room
And there began to quiz,
But Lead Belly vowed, as he began,
"Boss, I came to be your man!


"Boss, I killed, without my fault,
For it was an attack.
They jumped me, and I tell you, Boss,
I had to fight back."
Said Lomax, "So? Well, here you are,
And I need a driver for my car.


"But if some day on a lonely road
That knife of yours gets free - !"
"Oh, don' talk that way, Boss,
Don' talk that way to me!
If anyone tries to do you dirt,
I'll take the bullet before you's hurt!"


Lead Belly drives the Lomax car
And he is never tired;
He's a better man, John Lomax vows,
Than any he ever hired.
He sings at prisons to convict throngs
And helps John Lomax gather songs.
