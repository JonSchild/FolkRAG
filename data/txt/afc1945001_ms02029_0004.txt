Gentlemen :

            In accordance with the memorandum of Lavinia Engle,
Chief, Field Operations Division, Office of the Executive
Director, Federal Security Agency, Social Security Board,
dated July 29, 19142, we wish to report that we have heard
one rumor.
            On August 15, 1942, in Goodland, Kansas, a rumor
that the war would end by the first of January, 1943, was
heard. The rumor is attributable to a member of the United
States Navy, who is home on leave from Pearl Harbor.

                                                              Very truly yours,

                                                          [*Harris C. Hartman*]

                                                              Harris C. Hartman,
                                                              Manager
