themselves--even in order to be denied--because this tends to keep a group in the
focus of attention and encourages controversy and suspicion. The enemy wants us to
debate and suspect the activities of other groups.

The evidence shows clearly that many "hate-rumors" originate in the United
States as symptoms of domestic social and economic problems--especially those
problems which war creates or intensifies. Enemy propaganda has often picked up
these rumors and tried to increase their circulation [as an essential part of the
strategy of "divide and conquer."] But enem[e]y shortwave radio broadcasts reach a
very small audience in the United States and have largely been ignored by the
American public.

A list of the groups against which most current "hate-rumors" are directed
follows, in alphabetical order:

Army administration          Labor
Business                               Negroes
Catholics                               Profiteers
Defense workers                 Rationing Boards
Draft boards                        Red Cross
English                                  Russia
Farmers                                Unions
Jews

The false information carried by "hate-rumors" is less important than the
hatred which the rumors convey. Factual denials appear to have little effect
in stopping "hate-rumors." As one "hate-rumor" is exposed, it is replaced by
another rumor conveying the same hatred. It seems clear that persons who feel
certain hatreds will readily believe and repeat any rumor which gives expression
to that hatred. "Hate-rumors" obviously must be attached at the source--by curing
the cause of the hatred.

Information can, however, be used effectively to combat "hate-rumors" insofar
as they may be thoughtlessly belie[g]ved or repeated by persons who would otherwise
feel no violent or urgent hatred. Adequate information can serve to make the
repetition and progress of "hate-rumors" more difficult.
