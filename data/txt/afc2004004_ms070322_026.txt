Seamus was in town for a 3rd program
date. He wasn't very anxious to see me
- or else I offended him by not meeting
him at the BBC club - I was
trying to get the album ready to
show him. Anyhow he sort of avoided
me at lunch & [then] that later when
I went to his broadcast, he was
more friendly. The broadcast, by
the way, was the first 3rd program
I had heard - a program of
the music of the 15th Cent Composer
Landini, as arranged by a young
Cambridge don Dott. Seamus, who
couldn't get his pipes to tune to the
tempered scale, supplied only the
drone from his base reed, where
a guitar a harpsichord, an organ,
an oboe and others supplied noises
to back up [tw] a tenor & a
counter tenor who sang high
golden songs to long dead golden
ladies.
