Portnockie Road:  Blanche Wood:

1) Portnockie Road I've often trod when the moon was shining clear,
But another girl has ta'en my part, and I nae mair his dear.

2) He maybe thinks I lo'e him yet, but o it canna be,
For I am quite resolved now to shun his company.

3) If ever I'm to get o' him, or him to call my ain,
I'll make him welcome oot and in for the days of old lang syne.

Johnny Cope - James Wiseman:

1) Hey, Johnny Cope are ye walking yet
Or is your drums a-beating yet?
If ye be walking we will wait,
And we'll gang to the Codlings in the morning.

2) As we were on the Mussel Scarps
Just as hungry as any hawks,
We'd nothing to eat but a boiled eel
Coming hame frae the Codlings in the morning.

3) We'll gar the force of the mainsail Nor'
In the face of the draught she'll stout like a bear,
And I'm weel sure she'll beat them all,
Coming hame....

4) As we were sailing Sou' Ostend,
Twa three rhymes in the false alrm (?)
She was gaeing sprightly, merrily,
Coming hame...
