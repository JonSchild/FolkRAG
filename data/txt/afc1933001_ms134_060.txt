Memorandum to Dr. Spivacke

I recommend that the Library purchase 
Ausbund:  Etliche Sch√∂ne Christliche Lieder, 
Zehnte Auflage, Tenth Edition, Elkhart, Ind., 
1905.

The Library has several early editions 
of this hymn book but all of them are Sauer 
Press editions and cannot leave the Rare Book 
Room.

This hymn book is used by all the Amish 
in America and contains the texts of a number 
of hymns recorded by the Archive of American 
Folk Song in Indiana.  It will be valuable for 
further study of Amish and Mennonite music.
