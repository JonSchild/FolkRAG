THE SEARCHLIGHT 7
The Defection of Scherer

   Edward Scherer, former coal miner and
Labor leader of Carbon County, heretofore
has been signally honored by Organized Labor.
When he made his successful race for
the Legislature two years ago he was given
wholehearted support. Thereafter he was
given a Labor endorsement for high appointive
office in the State administration. A few
months ago he was elected treasurer of Labor’s
Nonpartisan League.
   Edward Scherer sat in Labor’s councils.
He enjoyed the confidence and esteem of leaders
and of the rank and file. If any member
of Organized Labor in Utah has owed a full
measure of devotion and constancy to the principles
and to the decisions of Labor, that man
is Ed Scherer.
   But like many other men who have placed
political expediency and service to Labor’s adversaries
above fidelity to the cause of collective
bargaining, Edward Scherer has fallen a
victim to political scheming. On Sunday, October
4, 1942, Scherer fathered an advertisement
in the Salt Lake Tribune soliciting votes
for Wendell Grover, candidate for the State
Senate in the runoff election.
Grover was regarded as the political brains
of the Maw administration and was violently
opposed by all divisions of Labor. Seldom in
Utah has Labor been so united in its opposition
to any individual. Manifestly then, Scherer’s
status as an influential member of Labor was
used by the State Machine to attempt to undermine
and break down Labor’s vigorous
stand against Mr. Grover. Sherer’s help
could be effective only in Labor circles. In any
other segment of the voting population an
endorsement by Scherer would have been
worthless. Knowing those facts, Scherer obligingly
performed against Labor—did so at the
behest of the Maw Machine.
   Scherer may argue that the Joint Legislative
Committee erred in opposing Grover. He
may find fault with the candidate Labor approved.
But the place was to make his stand on
such questions was before the Joint Legislative
Committee. When all divisions of Organized
Labor united in a decision to oppose Mr.
Grover, Edward Scherer was in honor bound
to respect that decision. If he felt that he
could not support Labor’s choice he should at


least have remained silent. Or he could have
withdrawn altogether from Organized Labor,
giving a statement of his reasons for so doing.
But he remained a member of Organized Labor
even while trying to overthrow Labor’s
program.
   The Joint Legislative Committee should
take cognizance of such attempts to thwart
its effort to protect the gains Labor has made 
in legislation. Until it enforces discipline and
respect and for its decisions Organized Labor can
never build up a potent force in politics. When
a political mess of pottage suffices to lure union
members from their plain duty, Labor should
strike such faithless ones form its rolls.

   The Scherer episode furnishes additional
proof that the Maw Machine has not scruples
to invade the ranks of Labor—has not hesitated
to use a prominent Labor member to subvert
and confuse Labor’s purposes. Herbert B. 
Maw was aware of Labor’s hostility toward
Grover—had been aware of it for two years.
Nevertheless His Excellency stood by while 
one of his chief political aids—Wendell Grover—
induced Scherer to betray Labor.
   To say that His Excellency knew nothing
about the affair, is to say that politically the
Governor of Utah is deaf, dumb, and blind.
To admit that Maw knew about it and yet permitted
the stealthy onslaught, is to level them
a conniver against Labor.

What is a Machine?

herds its lower tier members into the right
political corrals. What more does any political
machine do? Is anything else needed to make
the “organization” a machine?
   And since HIs Excellency, Herbert B. Maw
approved the formation of the Machine, and
approved the levy on State employees to create 
a slush fund—a fund that is growing
month by month right now — and since
His Excellency gave his warm approval
to the selections made for fund custodians;
why isn’t His Excellency a party—the guiding
party—to the birth, education, and functioning
of the now full-blown political Machine? There
is no room for doubt. It’s a Maw Machine.
