Clay Walters
Hendricks, Ky

Dear Mr. Walters,

I am disappointed that you could not play the duplicates I
sent you and I want to remedy this sad state of affairs if possible.
Will you send the records back to me and at the same time write
and tell me what machine or machines you have tried to play the
records on?  I'll try to make some duplicates for you that will
work a little better when I receive this information.

In the meantime I wonder ifit would be too much trouble for you
to write out the words to---

" 'Twas in the town of Jacksboro
In the year of '83,"---

the song about the buffalo hunters-- for me.

There is nothing I would enjoy more than making another visit
Salyersville and to your home in the hills.  Perhaps I will be able
to stop by again some day or, at the worst, send some one else
by to see you. I wonder if you have kept your promise to me to
practice up on the old songs you know and write them down?

Give my best regards to Mrs. Walters and to the others member
yours family.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
