Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter wandered around and finally
reached me.  I was very glad to hear from you again and to learn
that you are still pulling for our West.

I am more than glad to have the songs you
mentioned in your book,- Lone Driftin' Riders, The Drylanders, and 
Wandering Cowboy.  I am the author or composer of the first two,
both of the words and music; in the case of Wandering Cowboy, the
music alone is mine.

I am enclosing a copy of my Blu Eyed Girl,
the first song of its kind to be brought out as a kick and sweat.
This number has been introduced over the air on many programs, was
recorded by the leading record companies, and is being played by
most of the large bands throughout the country.  The rodeo band
always features it.  The publisher claims it will go down as the
first real cowboy Kick and Sweat and become a standard number.
I am sending it to you with the permission of the publisher for
your use, if you feel that you would like it in your book.

I am writing some more articles in the West
and am dickering over a book I have which I hope to see on the
market one of these days.  I sure want to finish up these things
and get out of here.

With best wishes and kindest regards,

Sincerely,
Pat Patterson
