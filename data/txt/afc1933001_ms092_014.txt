I have told Mrs. Seeger that you 
have the original statement
about author's corrections. Macmillan 
told me that she had written them 
that she wished to pay for all 
extra changes in music. So I sent 
her the bill for $55. for extraordinary music corrections. I am now 
writing her that I will pay 
the bill if she is unwilling 
or unable (I didn't say
it that way), for the money
is due now and in similar
situations I have[a] always so 
acted. And may the Lord give
you patience and forbearance.

Could you find out deftly and 
artistically what Mrs. Seeger
would take in cash for all 
her interests in Our Singing Country?
If so, pass the word along. J.A.L.
