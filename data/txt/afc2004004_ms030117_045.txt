if you pull off wid me an then pull off wid the othah fella, I'd kill
ye.  Thass right. . .Lot of people don't know how to stall a thang.
I nevah had a fuss wid a man bout a woman in my life.  Nevah did. I
tell you how I voided it.  I meet a man an talk wid him.  I say, "Less
us don't be a fool.  Less us have good sense.  Now you have the woman
an also I have huh.  So ef she had been any woman at all, you understand,
she wouldn't a had me an you too."  That's right.  No.
NO.  I wouldn't hurt a man's feelins bout a woman.  You wanna know
sumpin?  I'm gon tell you what's the truth.  I love my wife.  But I
could go theah this mawnin, an there's anothah man theah, you understan;
if that man is theah, she must not want me.  Cose ef I'd find em all
wrapped up theah , I'd keep em wrapped up theah an tie a string
aroun em.  I wouldn't have no words wid em.  If that man was theah,
she must didn't want me theah.  You understand.  But if I was to catch
em all wrapped up, tied up, I finish tying em up; put some strings
round em, an keep em tied up.  I nevah was so mad that I haven't
knowed what I'm doin.  I'm tellin you now, I'd keep em tied up theah
till the police come. . .No, if I'd catch em, I'd kill em.  Kill em daid.
     (Why do you think people are jealous?)
     That's not jealous.  Naw, it's not.  It's jes nothin but
right.  You think that's jealous?  Naw.  You catch a dog in yo meat
pot, somewhere where you got to git yo food out, what you goin do to
that dog?  Kick him out?  He's done put his mouth in that pot, an you
don't know where else he had his mouth?. . .No Sir.  That dog gon die.
I don't want nobody messin wid nothin I mess wid.  Cose, I don't act
no fool.  But you know, I tell you what I do.  If I tell huh I'm goin
off an be gone two three days, see, I got to know what I'm got on my
min.  If you be jealous, you can't do what you got to do.  You cain't
work.  Thass what I'm tryin to tell you. . .
