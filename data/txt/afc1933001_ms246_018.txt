Due to strenuous efforts on the part of myself, my secretary
and a large crowd of NYA workers, the Checklist is all collated,
six hundred pages of it, and there remains only the binding and
mailing to be done. We are about half through our first series of 
documentary radio programs,in which we will use fragments of
interviews, plus music, to build a series of transcriptions along
the lines of your Ballad Hunter series.I have definitely decided
to go the South America sometime in February, and in the meantime
my time will be taken up in preparation for the trip and in selecting
the material for our South American albums. I saw Bess
last week again, and she is much happier than she was at first,
and looks awfully nice. She's going to spend Christmas with us
here in Washington, after which I will go to the Modern Language
Association and Folklore meetings. Much love to you,
Deanie, Mike, Mrs. Mike, and John Allen,

Alan
