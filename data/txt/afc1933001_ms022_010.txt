Dear Mr. Lomax:

     American Ballads and Folk Songs has been so favorably 
reviewed and commented upon that I would like to look through 
the volume. I wonder how much, if any, of the book has been set 
aside for the songs of the hoboes? Have you that old bum masterpiece 
the Rock Candy Mountains in your collection? How about the
 Bums' Convention At Montreal?  Shortly before the War, Ford, the 
I.W.W. songster for that hobo-workers ' organization, The Industrial 
Workers Of The World, wrote You'll Get Pie In The Sky When You
 Die; this song is sung in the underworld from coast to coast. Have 
you any of his stuff in your collection? There are several of 
his songs printed in a book entitled American Tramp and Underworld 
Slang, by Godfrey Irwin, published by The Sears' Publishing Co. 
A fruitful source for some of the authentic songs of prisons 
are the various prison publications: the Bulletin of San Quentin, 
Good Words of Atlanta, The News of this penitentiary and The 
Mirror of Stillwater, Minnesota. 
 
   If you would care for the melodies for a number 
of these songs, I believe I could supply you with them. I am 
enough of a musician for that. The lyrics for The Rock Candy 
Mountains and the Bums' Convention could probably be found in
 their entirety if you would request them from the editor of 
the San Quentin Bulletin; I know part of the songs, but if you
 wanted the full lyrics you had better write to the Bulletin.

    Should you have a copy of American Ballads and
 Folk Songs you can spare I would be very glad to receive it-- 
its condition does not matter. When I have finished with it
 I will see that it is passed on to others who are as much interested 
in the subject as I am.
[*ask for this song
collection all those [?]
much appreciated*]
                                   
     I forgot to mention in the first paragraph a
 famous old song called, You're a Mormom,  -------- -------- --------! Go 
back to Utah. ( I had to leave out part of the title because
 our mail supervisor is a lady). You probably will be able to 
obtain this song if you write to the Utah penitentiary's paper, 
Pen Wiper. I can give you the melody.
     With best wishes for the continued success of 
American Ballads and Folk Songs, I am

                                                                                                                                                                                   Respectfully, 
                                                                                                                                                                                    John A Leslie
