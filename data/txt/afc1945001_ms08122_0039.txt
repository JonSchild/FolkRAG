"War Joke."

A sort of a joke was when President Roosevelt 
popped up unexpectedly in Africa without anyone 
knowing it but he and the people who went with 
him and those who are with him at the White 
House. Also the secret trip of Churchill to different 
countries. Then the secret and unexpected trips of
Mme. Chiang Kai-Shek to the White House. She
gained more power from the United States for
China. She also explained why the China Country
needed the help which we most all know
why.
