I MISS THEE OLD FARM
Tune--Last Night I Was Dreaming,
Last night I was dreaming,
My farm home, was dreaming,
I dreamed thou dids't promise we never would part.
With the soft breezes blowing
And high hopes aglowing,
I kiss thee and press thee, once more to my heart,
I kiss thee and press thee, once more to my heart.

I dreamed thou are living,
My farm home art living,
I dreamed that we promised we never would part.
With that soft soil upturning,
And memories burning,
I tread thee and wed thee, once more to by heart,
I tread thee and wed thee, once more to by heart.

But now thou art drifted,
My farm home art drifted,
Away from my heart never more to return.
Disappointment so galling,
Disaster appalling.
I miss thee and kiss thee away from my heart,
I miss thee and kiss thee away from my heart.

O MILITANT F--E--C--U
Tune--America.
O militant against the wrong,
With courage for the right,
Out heart aglow, convictions strong,
To win the farmer's fight.
F--E--C--U! F--E--C--U!
May God thy battle share,
And stir thy blood for those of sod,
And guide thy holy dare.

O militant against the wrong
Of wealth's cruel, selfish greed,
Lift up thy head to dream sublime
Of bondaged manhood freed.
F--E--C--U! F--E--C--U!
May God thy soul inspire,
To break the hold of cruel gold,
And gain man's one desire.
