And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the vale,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call'd me her below,
Will be forever mine.

Never fear the frozen stream.

All on earth is worthless dross;
If the Savior's love you feel,
Let the world behold your zeal.

Fire is good to warm the soul,
Water purifies the foul;
