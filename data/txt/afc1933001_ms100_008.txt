Dear Mr. Lomax:

    We have no recording machines available and even
if we did, we could not possibly get it to you in time.
On the other hand, I am recommending to the Acquisitions
Department that they authorize you to engage for us a
recording studio in Dallas to which you can take the man
and have him make the records there. Such rapid authori-
zations are possible for sums under $100, but I think that
this should be enough for one singer. This amount is to
cover not only the original recordings but also any
duplicates you may want or which you may want to give to
the singer. You can show your telegram of authorization
to the studio and ask them to bill us in accordance with
instructions. You should find this system preferable
because it means no outlay on your part and it gives you
considerable flexibility in ordering records. I look forward
to the pleasure of hearing them when the originals are sent
to the Library.

    With kindest regards,

    Sincerely yours,

    Harold Spivacke
    Chief, Music Division
