"FACT--Last week it was pointed out that
so much of this scrap rubber still is seen 
in piles because reclamation plants, even 
though now processing scrap rubber at the 
rate of one ton every minute, will be work-
ing the remainder of this year before they 
can utilize all the scrap collected. The 
rumor has been more widespread than was at 
first apparent and now from the WPR comes 
this further information:  'In practically 
every case the scrap rubber piles are being
held for disposal of the government.  Rep-
resentatives of WPB, all of them thoroughly
experienced in the scrap rubber business, 
are inspecting scrap yards belonging to 
leading dealers in every section of the 
country. Their reports indicate that nearly 
100 percent of the dealers so far visited 
have either sold or agreed to sell their 
whole stock of rubber scrap to the rubber 
company of the RFC, and to start the scrap 
on its way to rubber reclaiming plants as 
soon as the Rubber Reserve Company issues 
shipping instructions. Dealers have been 
told by the Rubber Reserve Company not to 
load freight cars until full shipping in-
structions have been received. As a conse-
quence many scrap piles now belonging to 
the government remain unmoved in dealers' 
yards."

The next pair does not even try to answer the rumor. It 
starts an argument, offers no fact, and finishes at a low level.

"RUMOR--The country will be so upset by all this 
conversion to war industry that we'll never get 
back to normal.
"Intent: To make Americans dread the aftermath 
of war so much that they'll not fight well.

"ANSWER--What would the rumormonger suggest? 
That we're so incapable of meeting domestic 
problems that it would be better right not to 
turn America over to the Japs and Germans?"

Where would we stand if the reader were inclined to say 
"yes" in answer to the last question, or if the reader believed 
that there might be some minor advantages to certain types of 
change.
