Shopped, fixed R's lunch, got car went 
to BBC, got machine fixed, took
ballad up to a job, played records,
picked up machine, home, ordered
supper, spliced tape till just

first rough cut.
Tomorrow will see Seamus, 
make final cuts & be nearly
done with it. God what
work. I know it's worth it
but I wonder more, & more if I
should be doing this. I really
should be writing before I get too old.
