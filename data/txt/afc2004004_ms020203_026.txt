Well, did they ever catch RR Bill or not? Did Rich say?
He didn't. He didn't say. Was he colored or white. Rich say he
was colored, because I remember astin him long ago was he
a white man or a colored man and he said RR Bill was a colored
man.
A: How about Stagolee? Which was he? White or colored?
V: He was colored, he said.
A: Where did he live.
V: He live-- I don't know sir where he live. . . I never did see him.
It was just a song that Rick Amerson sung bout him all de time.
Sung about Stagolee. He know about him. . .

(sings)
Don't you remember, you remember,
One dark and stormy night,
Stagolee and Billo Lyons
They had that noble fight.
Bad man, Stagolee,
Wasn he bad he had witha gun. . . 

Billo Lyon told Stagolee,
Please don't take my life,
I go three little childrens
And a loving little wife. . .

Stagolee told Billo Lyons,
I don't care for your three little childrens
Either your loving wife
You done stole-a my Steson hat
And I'm bound to take your life.
