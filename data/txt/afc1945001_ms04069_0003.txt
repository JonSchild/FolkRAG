"You know, it is almost impossible to get help. Some of
these boys who used to be willing to work are now employed by
contractors on defense projects and are getting  $120 a month and up.
One boy who left us to get a job as water boy with a
contractor out at the airport is  now drawing $120. You know
what that means. Contractors are operating on a cost plus
basis and the more wages they pay out the greater the profits."  39
