Tape:  1312 cont. Octa and Dion    4
AL:  Did you work on old mules back in those days?
Octa:  Oh yeah, I was 9 years old when I saw a plow with
a mule.  And in 1950, I bought me a tractor, so I stopped
walking so much.  But I was 60 years old when I stopped.
WEll, I had 2 sons, 3 sons who helped me a little bit, but
we had to send them to school.  So I worked on the tractor, or
with the mules all by myself.
Dion:  Well, I did very little farming.  When I got married,
see my daddy kept a store, he raised us all in a grocery store
in the country and he was a barber and he had a farm too.
So when I got married, I kept the store for about 3 years, I
guess, and then I went into the trucking business, then I
started working jobs.  I worked for the gas company for 31
years, I'm retired now from Standard Oil Co, I was a serviceman
for Standard Oil, been retired for 6 years. . . . . . . . .WEll,
sometimes we play 2, 3 times a week, like now we playing
twice a week, sometimes more than that.  But at our age, we
don't want to play too much.
AL:  But back when you were young, you played quite a lot.
I bet you've seen some mighty strange things happen out there
on the dance floor. . . . . . tell me about one of them.
Octa:  Well, at that time, I was a farmer, I worked allday on
the farm.  At night, I go play until 1 o'clock, I go back, I
go to sleep until 7, get up and pick cotton, and do all kinds
like that, all my life, that's the way I learned. . . . . . . .
how I got my new songs?  I just got in my head. . . . . .   . . . .
