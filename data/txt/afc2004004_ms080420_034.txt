[*R-6 begins*] REEL SIX [*Bill and Margaret Boyd*]
(Talk about audio levels.)
Alan: We're in the new found community, in Bunkum County
North Carolina, way back up in the Smokies near Canton,
where they manufacture paper and where people are among
the dancingest (?) folks in the United States. And we're
here to visit some of the best of the dancers. Bill Boyd
and his wife Margaret, and they're on a beautiful farm
up on the mountains, flowers along the road, and cattle
grazing on the hills. Lovely, lovely place. Tell us about
that dog of yours, you're an animal fancier aren't you?
[*Bill Boyd*] Man 1: Yeah, I got a Herman (?) out of the dog pen about
three months ago. I had a German Shepherd, had him trained,
and I found him up there in the pound and I started talking 
to him and he acted like he's going to be a nice dog and
so I gave the German Shepherd to my grandkid and I got him
out and he's made me a good cow dog, and a good friend.
I: What can he do? Show us.
Man 1: He can go get the cows and he stays with me all the
time when I'm at home, he's just a good pet.
I: He gets in these flowers, though.
Woman: He does (chuckles).
Man: He does like to play in the flower bed. After chasing
the cows he files up in the flower bed.
I: Can he bring those cattle in for you?
Man: Yeah, he brings the cows to the feed drop for me.
I: Where from?
Man: From way around the side of the mountain, everywhere
they're at, he goes and hunts them.
(Audio talk about the wind.)
I: Are you in the business of cattle raising?
