Wild West Weekly,
Fiddlin' Joe's Corner,
[Don't in]
Come To the Harrington Barn Dance.
(Sent in by Williams Clements, of Arkansas.)

Come all you wooly waddies,
Let's to Harrington's ranch,
The fiddlers are a-comin',
An' they're goin' to have a dance,

George has roped his old piana
An' drug it in the barn,
AN' tonight we're gonna pay
The mortgage off the little farm.

Such a dance as we're having
Has never [yet?] been had. yet,
Tom Kenyon is a-comin'
An' he's gonna call the sets.

[May?] Mat Miller plays the fiddle
And his brother plays the drum,
So slick up in yore war paint
An' git ready for the fun.

Jim Gilliland, the sherriff,
Will represent the law.
You should see the waddies step
To "The Turkey In The Straw."

Charley Summers is a-comin'
An' them bloomin' feet o' his,
Can do the old time schottische
Like nobody's biz.

"Footer Mac" will do the Charleston,
An' the gals will come from town.
George is gonna build a new barn,
So we'll tear the old one down.
