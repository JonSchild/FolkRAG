3)  Then to his bags he flew with speed
Aboot the drone he twsited,
Meg up and walloped o'er the green
For brawly could she frisk it.
"Well done," quo he. "Play on," quo she,
"Weel bobbed," quo Rab the Ranter.
"It's worth my while to play, indeed,
When I hae sich a dancer."

4)  "Well hae you played your pipes," quo Meg,
"Your cheeks are like the crimson.
There's nane in Scotland plays so weel
Since we lost Habbie Simpson.
I've lived in Fife, both maid and wife
For ten years and a quarter,
Gin ye should come to Anster Fair,
Spier ye for Maggie Lauder."

Wasna he a Roguey:
O wha my baby's clouts will buy,
O wha will tempt me when I cry?
O wha will kiss me 'fore I lie?
The ranting doby-daddy o't.
He peddles in, he peddles out,
He peddles late and early-o.
For seven long years hae I lain by his side,
And he's but a fuginless carlie-o.

Thacker's Horses:
1)  It's in your village when the bitter winds blow,
There lived one thacker whose name is well-known.
He keeps some cart-horses which was his delight,
To talk about them on a long winter's night,
Sing fal-de-dal, fal-de-dal ho.

2)  He works them both early and late in the night,
It takes all his time to get them their meat.
One thing puzzled Thacker which was a drawback,
He could neither keep skin nor hair on their back.

3)  A noted policeman who lived in this town
Was sent to trap Thacker as he did come down,
Thacker did shout and the whip it did crack,
When out sprang the bobby and bid him come back.
