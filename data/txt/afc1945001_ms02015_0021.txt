(1) It is assumed that the average field office should 
have a staff of thirty. In twenty-five states there is only 
one field office for the entire state. It is assumed that in 
these the field office would serve the entire population of 
the state concerned. In the case of Massachusetts there are 
both a regional office and a field office. The total population 
of metropolitan Boston was subtracted from the total 
population of the state. The remainder was assigned to the 
field office. In the case of New Jersey, there are four 
field offices. The population of the state is apportioned 
among these field offices on the basis of the relative size 
of the metropolitan areas in which these four offices are 
located.
