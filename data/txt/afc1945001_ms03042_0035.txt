- 6 - Rumors, 8-3 to 8-8 New York 8-14-42

New York 8-8: "If the Navy would stop construction on just one
of those antiquated battleships, we would have all the steel, copper and
aluminum we need."
Buffalo 8-5: "The steel companies control the WPB and have men
in the Navy. No competing companies can get in to make steel, and they
won't even set up new plants themselves because they want steel to be
scarce and high-priced.  That's just like the Aluminum Company."
Albany 8-5: "There is a lot of hokum and stupidity in this 
rubber situation.  Rubber is rotting away in the Montgomery Ward and 
Sears Roebuck warehouses.  Those companies can't sell the tires to the
public and the Government won't buy.  What sense does that make?"
Long Island City 8-7: "Sears and Montgomery Ward have too many
tires of passenger car size but can't sell them to anyone.  That rubber
is being wasted, and there are hundreds of other cases like that.  I 
think the WPB and OPA are trying to build a market for that new phoney
rubber controlled by Standard Oil."
New York 8-3: "There's supposed to be a shortage of aluminum 
but its a lot of hooey."
New York 8-4 (Hardware wholesaler): " I could tell you where to
pick up 100,000 tons of steel right this minute.  If the Government really
wanted steel in a hurry, it could get stocks like that, and it could also
buy up some of the simpler steel items like snow shovels and salamander
stoves for conversion."
Brooklyn 8-4: "A lot of this talk about shortages is just bunk.
It's passed out so that the WPB can justify this business of closing down
many small competitors of the big industries that control the show.  It's 
a squeeze play to help monopolies."
