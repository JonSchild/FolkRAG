5)  "I'll gie ye a sheaf o' my bread, Willie,
And a mutchkin o' my wine,
And ye'll pay me when the sea gangs dry,
For you'll ne'er be heir of Lynne."

6)  When he was the bonny heir of Lynne,
He had horses aye to his hand,
But noo he walks wi' a willow wand
Like a palmer through the land.

7)  He's  traveled East and he's travelled West
Through all the wynds of Lynne,
Till he minded of a wee siller key
That he wore next to his skin.

8)  This key was gi'en him by his old mother
When shewas near to dying,
And she tellt him to keep it for his muckle need
As ever had mithers son.

9)  He's travelled East and he's traveled West
Through all the wynds of Lynne,
Till he come unto an iron gate
And the key gaed sleeking in.

10)  There were seven keists of the white siller,
And seven of the gold sae fine,
And there he got reid gold enough
To free the lands of Lynne.

11)  And he has gane to a tavern house
Where the burgesses drink the wine,
Says, "Gie me a drink o' your wine, burgess,
The half of it is mine."

12)  And some would gie him a glass, a glass,
And some a fishes fin,
And some were wae for the beggar child
That had tint the lands of Lynne.

13)  Then up, it spake a proud burgess
And he crowed both crouse and hie,
Says, "I'll gie ye your bonny lands back again,
Gin ye'll show me but ae bawbee."

14)  "I will be witnesses, Willier," they cried,
"We'll witness untae thee.
And we'll pledge it in the blood red wine
But whaur's your ae bawbee?"
