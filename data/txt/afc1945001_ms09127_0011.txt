Rumors 

A lot of people have been 
spreading rumors about certain
things that aren't true.  They
say a certain thing has
happened that has not happened 
at all. So, no one should
spread rumors for you might
say something to help the enemy. 
War 
What is war, people say
It's not the time to put your
cares away, 
But give your neighbor's a helping
hand 
By doing everything you can , 
To help your country win the
war 
So we can have a peace for ever more.
