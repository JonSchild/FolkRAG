Well, well, it is me myself not more than because it is
Telemacque, I will always help you, eh....

Ah...dat's right.

Ready?
Give your name.
Mr. Nicholson, I am try(ing) [to] help you with your
comrades, because I can see they remain cold.
Yes; I take a little drink too.
I am giving you a "grog" for your fellows to be..

[O.k., my man!]

it in note!

Without misery...
Mr. Nicholson's men...
But it is for you [all] to give me another kind of
thing, you know, because I'm not drinking this drink; you all
are only giving me a glass without anything...
I myself do not want rum, eh!
You all, shut up. Mr. Hurtault is not drinking
this drink; so it is for you all to give him another drink. 

Note: To place it in note means: to put it in place
with great precision.
