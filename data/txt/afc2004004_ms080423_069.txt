(Man)    We hate to run, but we have another appointment.
AL:   We've got to go too.
Man:   I understand that you're goin to an auditorium in
Morris Hill(?) tonight.   We're goin' -- where are we goin'?!
AL:   Could you just tell us a word about the "primitive
quartet?"
Man:  The Primitive Quartet one of the greatest quartets, they
are, in this country.   They're a little crazy in the head.
Woman:   We think they're great!
Man:   They're the greatest quartet in this country, I mean
down-to-earth people that you can believe in -- you'll enjoy
their singing.   If you ever have an opportunity to go hear
tthe Primitive, you will not regret it.  It's been a joy,
so may God bless you.   And by the way, you've got a wonderful
crew, especially that lady up there with the mike.
