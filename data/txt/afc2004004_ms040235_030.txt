Glasgow.

Dear Hugh,

I forgot to mention the other day how much help it was for me to be able to use your library of Gaelic books.  You and Miss McPherson and Finlay Macdonald certainly did everything you could to make my stay in Scotland pleasant and successful, and I appreciate it very much.

In my opinion your Department could originate the most exciting musical broadcasts in Great Britain, given the will and the opportunity.  I am sure that this will one day come about.

With gratitude for many kind favours and courtesies,

I am yours very sincerely,

Alan Lomax
