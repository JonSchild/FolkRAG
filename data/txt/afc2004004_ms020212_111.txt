AGREEMENT BETWEEN: 

Edmund Carpenter and Alan Lomax, the latter acting as representative of the Bessie Jones Georgia Sea Island Group.

It is a proposed that a performance of the Bessie Jones Georgia Sea Island 
Group be recorded and filmed on May 11 and 12, 1963 in a studio on the campus 
of San Fernando Valley State College, Northridge, California. All arrangements
 for this film recording are to be the responsibility of Edmund
 Carpenter and the cost of film and its processing to be borne by him. No
 salaries will be paid any of the performers or film-makers.

All rights to this footage will remain the property of the Bessie Jones Georgia Sea Island 
Group, with the provision that if this Group decides
 to have the film completed by any one other than Edmund Carpenter, he is
 to be reimbursed for all costs of materials and laboratory expenses. 

If the footage obtained, in the opinion of Edmund Carpenter, warrants 
completion of the film, and the Bessie Jones George Sea Island Group does 
not wish to have the film completed by any one else, Edmund Carpenter will 
be authorized by Alan Lomax, subject to clearance by the San Fernando
 Valley State College Foundation, to seek a foundation grant, to be made
 to the San Fernando Valley State College Foundation, to be used to reimburse
 him for the costs of filming, plus the expenses of editing. The 
completed film will become the property of the San Fernando Valley State
 College Foundation. All royalties will be shared equally between the 
Bessie Jones Georgia Sea Island Group and the San Fernando Valley State 
College Foundation. All decisions regarding the sale and distribution
 of said film are to be those of the San Fernando Valley State College 
Foundation. Any additional revenues from rentals, television rights, 
foreign rights, sale of outs, clips or work-prints, are to be governed
 by this same financial and administrative arrangement.
