TAPE: R-83 cont. 4

we should do with thanksgiving. And it's pretty easy. A lot
of times, I thank the Lord that I've got my beagle hounds where
I can go rabbit hunting with them. That's "Hoss" right there
I raised and bred that dog, and a friend of mine's got him now.
Last Friday night, I turned down $1000 for that dog, turned
him down. Hoss is a good rabbit dog. (AL talks to dog) I don't
think.... Paul tells us all things should be received with
Thanksgiving, all things are good if God made 'em. And the
sport of rabbit hunting is one of the finest, one of the
cleanest sports that I know of. These fellas, we turn our
dogs loose, and we have just good clean fun. We laugh, and
my grandfather used to tell me, son, when you go rabbit hunting,
or fishing, that day won't count against you. You just live
another day longer, and so I believe what Grandpa told me. And
one of the great exhortations of the Bible is to honor your
father and mother....and he was my grandfather and you should
obey your elders and grandfather's a great hunter and he used
to tell us, don't you jump the bit, son, wait til he jumps up
and them shoot him. And I followed around after him and never
saw him miss a rabbit and I said Pa, I don't know why you
don't shoot one in a bed, you can't miss one running. So,
I guess this rabbit hunting is bred in me and I thoroughly 
enjoy it and I guess the second best thing in the world is
rabbit hunting- the first best is preaching when the holy spirit's
on me- I enjoy preaching. But I enjoy funning the rabbits.....
