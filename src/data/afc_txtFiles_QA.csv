Dear Alan:
I am extremely pleased that you will be able to lend us the bene-
fit of your considerable experience and expertise in ethnomusicology in
the production of the Voyager record.
Voyager I and Voyager II are unmanned deep space probes which will
be launched from Cape Canaveral in August and September, 1977. Their
mission is to examine close-up the major planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and
Uranus, their 20 some odd moons, and the rings of Saturn and Uranus.
After these fly-by observations are performed, the two spacecraft will
be ejected from the solar system, becoming mankind's third and fourth
interstellar space vehicles. The first two such vehicles, Pioneers 10
and 11, were launched some six years ago and contain a 6 x 9 inch gold
anodized aluminium plaque on which is etched some simple scientific in-
formation about the location of the Earth and the solar system in the
Milky Way Galaxy, and the moment in the ten billion year history of our
Galaxy when the spacecraft was launched. There are also drawings of a
man and woman.  The plaques were a sort of message in a bottle, cast
into the cosmic ocean, in case at some remote epoch in the future an
extraterrestrial civilization were to come upon Pioneer 10 or 11 and
wonder something about its origin.
Voyager permits us to continue on the Pioneer 10 and 11 experience,
but in a much richer way. When NASA asked me to chair a committee to
decide what should be the nature of the Voyager cosmic greeting card,
it soon became clear that much more information could be conveyed in the
same space on a metal mother of a phonograph record than on a plaque of
the same size. Since this is the 100th anniversary of Edison's invention
of the phonograph, a record seems particularly apt. NASA will be launching
on each Voyager a bonded pair of copper mothers containing the equivalent
of four sides of a 12-inch 33-1/3 rpm long playing record. One of these
sides will contain digital scientific information  largely diagrams
and pictures; a range of human voices, including some especially prepared
at the United Nations and one special greeting by Kurt Waldheim, the U.N.

Carl Engel, Esq.
3 East 43rd Street,
New York. 

Dear Mr. Engel:

On your request I saw yesterday the Fairchild people, with
reference to sound reproduction machines to be used in recording folk-songs, 
and for my purposes to be used where there are no possible electric connec-
tions. In other worlds, the machine must be operated by batteries. Such a 
machine the Fairchilds offered to build within three weeks time at a cost of 
$475. It will weigh about 300 lbs. Should they also build a platform for 
carrying the machine in the back of an automobile, the total cost would be
$500. The Fairchilds furnished a machine of this type to Prof. De Onise of
Columbia University, and Prof. Schindler of Bennington College, for recording 
folk-songs in Spain. Mr. Garwick claims that 200 successful recordings were 
made. 

I visited the Amplion people this morning. They asked me
$495 for a similar machine complete, the chief difference being that their 
machine weights less than 100 lbs. The Amplion people inform me that Dr. 
Greet of the English Department of Columbia University has in use an outfit
purchased from them that has given entire satisfaction. They also claim
that New York University has recently purchased a machine. 

Both of these companies gave me satisfactory evidence that 
their machines operate successfully, both in recording and reproducing
singing, when such a recording is done under the favorable conditions of 
their own equipment and expert operation. I did not have an opportunity 
of hearing any records played that had been made under field conditions. 

I am deeply grateful for your very kind interest in my work 
and the constant courtesy you have shown me. 

Sincerely yours, 
John A. Lomax  [?]

P.S. For your information, a letter addressed to me in care of General
Delivery, Albany, New York, will reach me any time for a week. After that, 
I shall be at the University of Texas, Austin, Texas. 

P.P.S. Prof. De Onise tells me the machine was entirely satisfactory.

battery operated recording instrument and I hope to be able to duplicate it for you.  I have seen Mr. Engel and he will advise me as soon as word comes from Washington to proceed.  Since I talked with you Fairchild has stiffly increased the prices of all instruments much against my will 
- their battery portable now is $600 and as our ideas of policy and construction are getting farther apart every day 
I have decided to sever my connections with them.  Every improvement in their instrument has directly come about through me and my efforts and I have already given them much 
of the specifications for the instrument which I will agree to build for you for $450.00 including batteries.  If you wish to provide your own batteries, deduct $30.00 (see specifications 
for description) I will have as my technical staff the engineers at the studio where I took you.  These men are recognized as being 
at the very top and are called in or have been by the other manufacturers of recording instruments.  They have a reputation 
for making the best metal and wax records in this city.  Part of the equipment which I propose to use has been in constant 
use there for many months.

     The objection that I have always had to the Fairchild portable in size, weight and power will be eliminated as the 
weight of each of the two cases will almost be cut in half 38 to 45 pounds instead of 70 to 75 lbs.  The size of the case will be 17 x 17 x 16, about 2/3 of the Fairchild size.

     I can not cut the weight of the batteries except to cut the quality of the recording.  I am, however, using the same batteries as with the Fairchild or other standard 
set despite that fact that I will provide an amplifier with at least 4 times that of the Fairchild set.

If you use one 6 volt wet battery you will have 20 hours of recording - two will give you more satisfaction and about 40 hours.  You could carry a small trickle charger and one battery and keep it charged up to full capacity.

You will need 180 volts of B battery and these will 
last a long, long time.  On my new outfit you maycut either celluloid or metal and you will get 20% more on every disc 
than on any other standard instrument as it will cut 120 lines to 
the inch in metal discs.  In changing from metal to

celluloid only the cutting head is changed - - - takes about 2 minutes. Celluloid cutting calls for a little more skill but is the coming method. There are many features for convenience and better recording that will be included that
will not be found on any other instrument. I have travelled
about 30,000  miles during this past year with various kinds of portable recorders - starting out with a bulky one in a
large wooden box to the present type of Fairchild and I have
demonstrated -recorded and played records in every conceivable
place and in the meantime have been constantly at work
designing and improving these recording instruments and I
believe that, with the engineering talent and facilities
which I will have at work for me that no one is in better
position for producing your instrument. The men who sit
behind desks in factories are needed of course, but they
have no conception of what is needed out in the field.

I will have specifications on weight, size and power
and a N. Y. office in a few days. In the meantime would
you like to give it a name? What would be a classic name
for echo or reproduction? I will greatly welcome your
suggestion I have guaranteed the Atlas the finest recorder
for this type of work and they have dealt long enough with
me to believe that I can do this without any question. I
have been handicapped heretofore with antiquated equipment
that had to be used up but now I am free to build with the
latest material and ideas.

Already this set is the fastest selling and so far
it is going only to the professional trade, such as the
studios, you visited, the radio station etc.

Later I may be compelled to make a slight raise in
price because I am giving far more than any other manufacturer.
The amplifier alone will cost many times the
one in the Fairchild and similar jobs but that is the
boiler works and where quality should begin.

Dear Mr. Garwick:

       I very much appreciate your two letters,
describing in detail the new recording machine which 
you propose to sell to Mr. Engel for me to use. I 
am writing to Mr. Engel. Of course, I hope to have
the very best machine available; but my chance to 
secure your machine must come through him. I can not,
myself, afford the expense.

         I, too, hope that we can get together
some time soon so that you can make a record of a
couple of my cowboy songs, along with the yodels.
      I hope you will let me hear from you again.

Mr. Carl Engel,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have received two long letters from 
Mr. Garwick.  I am handing you herewith a copy of 
the last one.

Among the men I interviewed while in 
New York, this man impressed me as the most dependable 
because he has had the actual experience with 
trying out the recording machines under all sorts 
of road difficulties.  Of course, he has something 
to sell and wants to sell it.  You will notice that 
he has made a substantial reduction in price over 
what has been quoted.  Another important and favorable 
change is in the weight of the machine, which 
must be carried in a light car, because we will travel 
far away from concrete pavements.

You are busy with ten thousand other 
calls on your time; but I do wish that you would 
write and let me know what prospects you have found 
of securing a machine for my use this summer as I 
travel back to Washington.  To freshen your mind 
again, I plan to visit the chain gang camps of 
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and the negro 
districts of New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis and 
St. Louis and any other of the river towns that 
seem worth while, stopping at as I journey by river 
steamer from New Orleans to St. Louis.  Of course, 
I expect to find interesting voices in the groups 
of negro workers on the steamboats on which I travel, 
as well as among the negro roust-a-bouts at the 
places where we stop en route.

I again assure you of my deep appreciation 
of  your courtesy and kindness during my stay 
in Washington.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax,
