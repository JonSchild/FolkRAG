My dear Mr. Lomax:

This much I can report:
1) the money for the purchase of a recording machine, not to cost more than about five hundred dollars, is available;
2) Mr. Garwick (whom you saw in New York) has left the Fairchild Co. and is working on a machine which is to weigh considerably less than the Fairchild model, and has assured me that, equipped with every possible improvement, it will not cost more than $500.

I hope to see Mr. Garwick in New York about June 5 or 6, when I expect to have more definite news for you.

Faithfully,
Chief, Division of Music

My dear Mr. Lomax:

My note of May 27 was not in reply to yours of May 24, which I received
only this morning. The letter of May 19, from Mr. Garwick - of which you sent
me a copy - confirms what I understood him to say when I last saw him in New
York.

As I wrote to you, I expect to have a talk with him in about a week. I have
yet to learn how long it will take him to complete the machine for the Library.

If you have settled on a definite date for the beginning of your tour,
your letter does not reveal it. Other important information is where to ship
the machine when it is ready, whether to Austin or to some place near the spot
where you propose to begin your recording. It would seem wiser, however, to
send the machine to you where you can test it before you go on the road, and
have any possible fault corrected before you are in the field.

Do I understand you to say that you would be motoring all the way to Washington
and deliver the machine to us on your arrival?

What about records? Will you provide them? Shall we provide them? What
kind do you propose to use? Aluminum or celluloid?

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

My dear Mr. Lomax, 

Your note of May 30 reached me this morning in New York. I had a talk yesterday afternoon with Mr. Garwick. He showed me photographs of the machine he proposes to build. His promises sound rather hopeful, and I trust he will realize them. I am to get the specifications within a day or two. Meanwhile, I have told him that we definitely want him to build us a machine and he assured me that he would lose no time. However, even with the utmost speed, it will probably take at least two weeks to have the machine in readiness. Then their remains the shipping of it to Texas, which will probably mean another three or four days. There-fore, it might be safe to say that the machine cannot possibly be in your hands for another three weeks.

Your note still fails to disclose whether the forwarding address given in it is also the one to which you would want the machine expressed.
