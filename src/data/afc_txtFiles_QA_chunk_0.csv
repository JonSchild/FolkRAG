Dear Alan:
I am extremely pleased that you will be able to lend us the bene-
fit of your considerable experience and expertise in ethnomusicology in
the production of the Voyager record.
Voyager I and Voyager II are unmanned deep space probes which will
be launched from Cape Canaveral in August and September, 1977. Their
mission is to examine close-up the major planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and
Uranus, their 20 some odd moons, and the rings of Saturn and Uranus.
After these fly-by observations are performed, the two spacecraft will
be ejected from the solar system, becoming mankind's third and fourth
interstellar space vehicles. The first two such vehicles, Pioneers 10
and 11, were launched some six years ago and contain a 6 x 9 inch gold
anodized aluminium plaque on which is etched some simple scientific in-
formation about the location of the Earth and the solar system in the
Milky Way Galaxy, and the moment in the ten billion year history of our
Galaxy when the spacecraft was launched. There are also drawings of a
man and woman.  The plaques were a sort of message in a bottle, cast
into the cosmic ocean, in case at some remote epoch in the future an
extraterrestrial civilization were to come upon Pioneer 10 or 11 and
wonder something about its origin.
Voyager permits us to continue on the Pioneer 10 and 11 experience,
but in a much richer way. When NASA asked me to chair a committee to
decide what should be the nature of the Voyager cosmic greeting card,
it soon became clear that much more information could be conveyed in the
same space on a metal mother of a phonograph record than on a plaque of
the same size. Since this is the 100th anniversary of Edison's invention
of the phonograph, a record seems particularly apt. NASA will be launching
on each Voyager a bonded pair of copper mothers containing the equivalent
of four sides of a 12-inch 33-1/3 rpm long playing record. One of these
sides will contain digital scientific information  largely diagrams
and pictures; a range of human voices, including some especially prepared
at the United Nations and one special greeting by Kurt Waldheim, the U.N.

Carl Engel, Esq.
3 East 43rd Street,
New York. 

Dear Mr. Engel:

On your request I saw yesterday the Fairchild people, with
reference to sound reproduction machines to be used in recording folk-songs, 
and for my purposes to be used where there are no possible electric connec-
tions. In other worlds, the machine must be operated by batteries. Such a 
machine the Fairchilds offered to build within three weeks time at a cost of 
$475. It will weigh about 300 lbs. Should they also build a platform for 
carrying the machine in the back of an automobile, the total cost would be
$500. The Fairchilds furnished a machine of this type to Prof. De Onise of
Columbia University, and Prof. Schindler of Bennington College, for recording 
folk-songs in Spain. Mr. Garwick claims that 200 successful recordings were 
made. 

I visited the Amplion people this morning. They asked me
$495 for a similar machine complete, the chief difference being that their 
machine weights less than 100 lbs. The Amplion people inform me that Dr. 
Greet of the English Department of Columbia University has in use an outfit
purchased from them that has given entire satisfaction. They also claim
that New York University has recently purchased a machine. 

Both of these companies gave me satisfactory evidence that 
their machines operate successfully, both in recording and reproducing
singing, when such a recording is done under the favorable conditions of 
their own equipment and expert operation. I did not have an opportunity 
of hearing any records played that had been made under field conditions. 

I am deeply grateful for your very kind interest in my work 
and the constant courtesy you have shown me. 

Sincerely yours, 
John A. Lomax  [?]

P.S. For your information, a letter addressed to me in care of General
Delivery, Albany, New York, will reach me any time for a week. After that, 
I shall be at the University of Texas, Austin, Texas. 

P.P.S. Prof. De Onise tells me the machine was entirely satisfactory.

battery operated recording instrument and I hope to be able to duplicate it for you.  I have seen Mr. Engel and he will advise me as soon as word comes from Washington to proceed.  Since I talked with you Fairchild has stiffly increased the prices of all instruments much against my will 
- their battery portable now is $600 and as our ideas of policy and construction are getting farther apart every day 
I have decided to sever my connections with them.  Every improvement in their instrument has directly come about through me and my efforts and I have already given them much 
of the specifications for the instrument which I will agree to build for you for $450.00 including batteries.  If you wish to provide your own batteries, deduct $30.00 (see specifications 
for description) I will have as my technical staff the engineers at the studio where I took you.  These men are recognized as being 
at the very top and are called in or have been by the other manufacturers of recording instruments.  They have a reputation 
for making the best metal and wax records in this city.  Part of the equipment which I propose to use has been in constant 
use there for many months.

     The objection that I have always had to the Fairchild portable in size, weight and power will be eliminated as the 
weight of each of the two cases will almost be cut in half 38 to 45 pounds instead of 70 to 75 lbs.  The size of the case will be 17 x 17 x 16, about 2/3 of the Fairchild size.

     I can not cut the weight of the batteries except to cut the quality of the recording.  I am, however, using the same batteries as with the Fairchild or other standard 
set despite that fact that I will provide an amplifier with at least 4 times that of the Fairchild set.

If you use one 6 volt wet battery you will have 20 hours of recording - two will give you more satisfaction and about 40 hours.  You could carry a small trickle charger and one battery and keep it charged up to full capacity.

You will need 180 volts of B battery and these will 
last a long, long time.  On my new outfit you maycut either celluloid or metal and you will get 20% more on every disc 
than on any other standard instrument as it will cut 120 lines to 
the inch in metal discs.  In changing from metal to

Mr. Carl Engel,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have received two long letters from 
Mr. Garwick.  I am handing you herewith a copy of 
the last one.

Among the men I interviewed while in 
New York, this man impressed me as the most dependable 
because he has had the actual experience with 
trying out the recording machines under all sorts 
of road difficulties.  Of course, he has something 
to sell and wants to sell it.  You will notice that 
he has made a substantial reduction in price over 
what has been quoted.  Another important and favorable 
change is in the weight of the machine, which 
must be carried in a light car, because we will travel 
far away from concrete pavements.

You are busy with ten thousand other 
calls on your time; but I do wish that you would 
write and let me know what prospects you have found 
of securing a machine for my use this summer as I 
travel back to Washington.  To freshen your mind 
again, I plan to visit the chain gang camps of 
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, and the negro 
districts of New Orleans, Vicksburg, Memphis and 
St. Louis and any other of the river towns that 
seem worth while, stopping at as I journey by river 
steamer from New Orleans to St. Louis.  Of course, 
I expect to find interesting voices in the groups 
of negro workers on the steamboats on which I travel, 
as well as among the negro roust-a-bouts at the 
places where we stop en route.

I again assure you of my deep appreciation 
of  your courtesy and kindness during my stay 
in Washington.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax,

My dear Mr. Lomax:

My note of May 27 was not in reply to yours of May 24, which I received
only this morning. The letter of May 19, from Mr. Garwick - of which you sent
me a copy - confirms what I understood him to say when I last saw him in New
York.

As I wrote to you, I expect to have a talk with him in about a week. I have
yet to learn how long it will take him to complete the machine for the Library.

If you have settled on a definite date for the beginning of your tour,
your letter does not reveal it. Other important information is where to ship
the machine when it is ready, whether to Austin or to some place near the spot
where you propose to begin your recording. It would seem wiser, however, to
send the machine to you where you can test it before you go on the road, and
have any possible fault corrected before you are in the field.

Do I understand you to say that you would be motoring all the way to Washington
and deliver the machine to us on your arrival?

What about records? Will you provide them? Shall we provide them? What
kind do you propose to use? Aluminum or celluloid?

Faithfully yours,

My dear Mr. Lomax, 

Your note of May 30 reached me this morning in New York. I had a talk yesterday afternoon with Mr. Garwick. He showed me photographs of the machine he proposes to build. His promises sound rather hopeful, and I trust he will realize them. I am to get the specifications within a day or two. Meanwhile, I have told him that we definitely want him to build us a machine and he assured me that he would lose no time. However, even with the utmost speed, it will probably take at least two weeks to have the machine in readiness. Then their remains the shipping of it to Texas, which will probably mean another three or four days. There-fore, it might be safe to say that the machine cannot possibly be in your hands for another three weeks.

Your note still fails to disclose whether the forwarding address given in it is also the one to which you would want the machine expressed.

Baton Rouge, Louisiana

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Three days ago, while in New York, I had Mr Garwick show me the machine. He 
tested it thoroughly in my presence, I spoke and sang a few little snatches into 
the mike myself, and gained the impression that, if properly handled, the machine 
should give excellent results.

I was more impressed with the recording on aluminum discs than on celluloid. 
But I understand that the celluloid records have certain advantages over the metal 
ones; they are certainly lighter and probably more easily handled.

I have this morning received a letter with shipping instructions. I am forwarding 
these at once to Mr. Garwick. There remain a few finishing touches to be applied 
to the machine, but he promised to have it ready for shipment by July 3 or 5.  
This should bring it to Baton Rouge in time for your arrival there about July 10.

Dear Mr. Lomax:   
I regret very much my delay in answering your letter
of January 24, which reached me at State College; but an
attack of illness, which struck me shortly before your letter
arrived, so ""slowed me up"" that it was all I could do to
keep my required work going for the rest of the school year.
I neglected everything but schoolwork and my correspondence
with my family.
In the part of country where I have been finding the
material I have, the great bulk of the folksongs are of
British origin - as is the case, I presume, in most early-settled
""singing districts"". However, I have recovered quite a
few of the indigenous pieces to which your special study is
directed. A number of them certainly must be quite widely
known, as I see versions of them in most collections that
I chance to look into; and I have no doubt but what you
are acquainted with them all, and perhaps have far better texts
in your collection than any I have been able to recover.
I shall list the native songs in my collection which
seem to be widely known - or, at least, which I personally
have found in collections from different parts of the country.

Poor Omie
The Jealous Lover
      (Pearl Bryan)
Banks of the O-hi-O
     (old Pedee)
Dying Cowboy
St. James's Hospital

The Dying Californian

The Bright, Sunny South
McAfee's Confession

Drunkard's Doom
Lonesome Dove

     (Title fr. Sharp Eng. FSS from the
                Southern appalachians)
Little Mohee
The Wreck on the C&O (fragment, with air)
The Single Girl
Colonel
In Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-One
Liza Jane [?]
The Frozen Girl
The Gambling Man

I think all these pieces are
indigenous, tho' I am no scholar
who can trace them to their sources.
But I know you are well acquainted
with all of them.

IT is a story of a ""proud beauty"" who rejected her poor suitor, and

soldier's last words. It contains the lines:
O soldier, soldier, when I am gone, 
Oh, write a letter to my home, 
And tell my mother she must not mourn

which tells how a wife ""beat up"" her faithless husband, is apparently 
of native make too, tho' it's filled with old, folksong formulas.

In speaking of the native songs which were widely current,
I forgot to mention one which is known outside my district,
and which seems to be indigenous. My version begins:
Young Paddy's sore diggin' taters in the sand,
Brogues on his feet and a shovel in his hand.
He went down the street as hard as he could run,
and all he could say was, Johnny, git your gun,
Mushy ding!

It is about a boy who enlisted, and the equipment he received! In 
my part of the country it is called ""The Irish Potato"".

There are songs in my collection that I don't know whether
to label ""indigenous"" or not.  They might be of native make, and
they might also be of some late Anglo-Irish composition.   Such a one
is this, which you probably know about, tho' I don't. It is 
rather widely known; in the Appalachians, at any rate:
Come all you maids of a rambling nature, 
Come listen to my mournful song,
I loved a fair one beyond my duty;
I suffered more than the common run.

Another one of this sort is the following,— I'll give a stanza out of 
the middle:
I think it's high time to leave off the lads,
And commence on the ladies - they're four times as bad.
They'll powder their face and comb up their hair,
Like an owl in the bush at the boys they will stare.

The refrain, as I have heard it, is: ""Derry down, down, hi derry down"", or 
""Li-o, li-o, ladl-i-o!""

I have a few compositions, also, that were made in my own
particular part of the country, and were very popular there about 
forty years ago. Like most of our folksongs of comparatively recent
date, these are either laments or satires. I think it very improbable
that they have attained any wider currency than in the southwestern 
corner of Pennsylvania, and the neighboring counties of 
West Virginia. One of them  is a lament for a murdered girl. It 
begins: 
Come all you good people, wherever you be, 
Come listen a while to my sad tragedy.

Another one of this sort is the following,— I'll give a stanza out of the middle: I think it's high time to leave off the lads, And commence on the ladies - they're four times as bad. They'll powder their face and comb up their hair, Like an owl in the bush at the boys they will stare. The refrain, as I have heard it, is: ""Derry down, down, hi derry down"", or ""Li-o, li-o, ladl-i-o!"" I have a few compositions, also, that were made in my own particular part of the country, and were very popular there about forty years ago. Like most of our folksongs of comparatively recent date, these are either laments or satires. I think it very improbable that they have attained any wider currency than in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, and the neighboring counties of West Virginia. One of them is a lament for a murdered girl. It begins: Come all you good people, wherever you be, Come listen a while to my sad tragedy. (over)```","### Instruction ###

you will agree that the ones given in my first list are so widely 
known as to be familiar to every collector. The others I have quoted

far more about that than I. The indigenous pieces in my collection are a
very small part of the whole, which consists mostly of the old British songs, 
versions of which are found all over the country.
  If there are any of these songs about which you wish to have 
more details, I shall be glad to tell you what I know – which isn't 
much, but might possibly prove helpful or interesting in your study. 
I will quite frankly admit that my interest is centered more on music 
than on texts, and that the imported old-country songs absorb me 
more than the American-made ones; which I have noted down simply 
as a matter of duty and record, as a collector should. I am not blind, 
however, to the value of specialized study of these native products; and 
if any details I can furnish you will aid in the solving of problems 
connected with indigenous folksong, I shall be only too glad to

Mr. John A. Lomax
% Professor Ives,
Dept. of Education,
Barton Rouge La.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
I have just returned from Boston, where Idelivered a duplicate
of your instrument to the Linguistic Atlas people. I believe that 
these two instruments have made the finest records, both on metal
and celluliod, that I have ever heard.

I hope ere this that you are making good records yourself. I
am awaiting with much interest a sample of your recording, after
you had the new stylus and the correct microphone in use.

Yesterday I stopped in to see the Edison Battery people to learn
something more about those batteries, I enclose a booklet that
should be useful to you.

I also wish to advise that it is best to allow for the needle
load when testing the turntable speed. Press your finger slightly
aginst the turntable when testing and that should compensate for the
needle load. If you do not allow for the needle load your records
will be made at slightly lower speed than 78 R. P. M. and when you
play back at 78 R. P. M. the pitch will be a little higher. I also
found out that the regular automobile batteries for the same power
as the Edison type would weigh in excess of 200 lbs. as gainst the
130 lbs. for the Edison.

I can build an attachment for using this instrument with A. C.
current for $75. It would be necessary for you to change the motor
each time, but that is rather easy. I am building this for the Atlas
people. You will find it a great convenience quite often.

I can also supply a 6 ampere Tungar battery charger at the wholesale
price of $16.80 (this is my cost ); retail price is $24. this
will fully charge your batteries in about 35 hours. Please let me
know how you are getting along ,for I can read a lot from a sample
record.

There is no doubt that you have one of the two finest recording
sets in the country, and that is not only of my opinion, but of the
expert sound engineers, who have heard it.

New Orleans, Louisiana

My dear Mr. Lomax:

I received this morning your letter of July 19th, from Baton
Rouge, with Mr. Garwick's letter enclosed. I am much distressed
to hear that the machine is not giving immediate satisfaction, and
I am particularly disappointed, because the tests to which the
machine was subjected in my presence in New York, and the recordings
which I myself made, seemed to indicate a remarkable degree
of perfection. Mr. Garwick picked up radio music, and I spoke
and sang into the machine. When played back, the discs gave a
very true and smooth performance, though the metal discs seemed to
me possibly preferable to the celluloid ones. I am sure that Mr.
Garwick will, in his own interest, see that the machine is put into
working condition. His willingness to join you in Memphis should
be a guaranty.

As regards the weight of the machine, I understand that it
does not exceed the specifications, but, if anything, is slightly
less. Apparently any machine, dependent on batteries, weighs more
than one fed on light current. I understand, however, that you
felt a battery machine was necessary because of the likelihood of
your wanting to use it in places where light current could not be
had.

I am most grateful to you for your interest and for your
prompt and minute reports. I trust that you will keep me informed
about the progress you are making with the recordings. In the
meantime, I am holding up Mr. Garwick's voucher until I get more
encouraging news from you.

With kindest regards and best wishes for the ultimate success
of your trip, I am

Dear Mr. Engel;
Father is in the hospital with a rather bad
attack of malarial fever, which he contracted at the
Lousiana state farm about two weeks ago. Our plans,
of course, aredependent upon his good health. New
Orleans has, so far, proved a very barren field for
collection. The river packets are gone and with them
the singing roustabouts. The police have driven out th
""Hoo-doo"" dances. And the speaking of Creole is entirely

My dear Mr. Lomax:

   I am much concerned to learn from your postal, received this 
morning, that your Father is ill and at the hospital. I hope that
he will rapidly overcome the attack and be able to resume his trip
without much delay. Kindly give him my regards and good wishes
for a speedy recovery.
As regards the machine, I am much relieved to hear that it is 
working more satisfactorily and that what you at first thought were
defects of the apparatus have proved to be - quite explicable - defects 
in your technique. The tests that I witnessed in New York were
surprisingly good. I am sure that your own recordings will very soon 
equal them.

BY JOHN A. LOMAX

Address: University of Texas Station,
Austin, Texas

Author of ""Cowboy Songs"" and ""Songs of the Cattle Trail""; for three
years Sheldon Fellow for the Investigation of American Ballads; twice
President of the American Folklore Society; one of the organizers
and the first Secretary of the Texas Folklore Society.

1. The Songs of the Cowboy
2. Negro ""Spirituals""
3. Songs of the ""Worl'ly"" Negro
4. Cowboy Verse
5. Types of the American Ballad

THESE LECTURES are popularized abridgements of papers read before the
Modern Language Association of America. Much of the material used
has never appeared in print, and Mr. Lomax endeavors to interpret the
spirit of the Folk-Songs by sympathetic recital and singing rather than by
a conventional lecture. Audiences throughout the United States have been
surprised to discover that much genuine poetry has remained buried and
unnoticed in these rough ballads of our own people. In the hope that
these changing songs may all be recorded before they disappear, wherever
he goes, Mr. Lomax seeks conferences with those who know Folk-Songs.
These lectures are offered singly or in series.

you must have seen, were delighted, and the members of the Faculty who were present
were equally interested.""

PROFESSOR WILLIAM LYON PHELPS, Yale University:
""Every moment of the hour was interesting; he succeeds to a high degree in combining
definite instruction with continuous entertainment.""

DEAN L. B. R. BRIGGS, Harvard University:
""Every member of the modern language conference that I have met has expressed
real pleasure in hearing your paper the other night. The more colleges that get a
chance at your lectures the better.""

CARL SANDBURG:
""I think no one delivers the cowboy songs with the reality, the truth to life, that
is heard in the Lomax renditions. He gets their stride and stridency, and their rough
tang.""

PROFESSOR L. E. BASSETT, Stanford University, California:
""Our audience was delighted with the vivid glimpses of the life of the cowboy and
the striking description and rendition of cowboy songs.""

PROFESSOR ARTHUR C. L. BROWN, Northwestern University, Evanstan, Ill.""
""John A. Lomax's reading and lecture entitled Negro Spirituals was highly successful
and entertaining. The students would go to hear him again if they had the chance,
I am sure.""

PROFESSOR HERBERT E. GREEN, Johns Hopkins University:
""At the University and at church today I have heard favorable comments on the
lecture from people of various ages, tastes, and callings.""

PROFESSOR REED SMITH, University of South Carolina:
"" 'Best thing I ever heard in that old chapel,' is a comment several students have
made to me.""

PROFESSOR LEWIS F. MOTT, College of the City of New York:
""The students showed the most intense interest from beginning to end, and many
spoke to me afterwards of the pleasure and profit they had derived from this presentation
of a phase of American life.""

PROFESSOR FREDERICK TUPPER, JR., University of Vermont:
""Professor Lomax's genial address upon 'Cowboy Songs' made such a delightful
impression upon us all that, for the past month, refrains and choruses of the ranches
have been humming in our heads, and certain phrases of the plains bid fair to become
proverbial among us.""

J. C. SEEGARS, Dean of Temple University, Philadelphia:
""Both faculty members and students have expressed enthusiastic appreciation to me
and we feel that your visit was a distinct contribution. We hope to have you again
next year.""

PROFESSOR FRANK C. BROWN, Trinity College, North Carolina:
""All who heard you here-Faculty, students and friends alike-were greatly pleased
with your lectures.""

PROFESSOR J. W. TUPPER, Lafayette College:
""We get a picture complete of the Cowboy life and all its emotions. Even the free,
easy, open-hearted style of the songs pictures just such a life on the broad plains of the
great Southwest:
""If the ocean was whiskey and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom to get one sweet sup.""

PROFESSOR S. M. TUCKER, Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn:
""Perhaps the pleasantest evening of our college year was Professor Lomax's lecture
on 'Cowboy Songs and Ballads.' I have never seen a more interested audience.""

PRESIDENT R. E. BLACKWELL, Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, Va.:
""The students are still talking about the questions that your lectures raised, and your
visit has done good in turning the interest to the subject of our ballads.""

PRESIDENT CHARLES C. THACH, Alabama Polytechnic Institute:
""It was in every way a delightful event, keenly enjoyed every minute by the large
audience. It seemed like a genuine echo from the Western prairie.""

PRESIDENT A. H. UPHAM, Miami UNiversity, Ohio:
""It has been my privilege thrice to present him to student audiences, who have
received him most enthusiastically and clamored for his return.""

PROFESSOR M. ELLOWRRD SMITH, Oregon State College:
""Your songs furnish lecture material in a class by itself. Quite beyond the mere
humor of many of them, it is their fundamental human nature which takes the
audiences.""

PROFESSOR EDWIN F. SHEWMAKE, Davidson College, N. C.:
""Students, professors and townspeople were captivated by the way in which you
revealed the romantic charm, the pathos and the humor of cowboy life as reflected in
the songs.""

DEAN J. O. CREAGER, University of Arizona.
""To say that his Harvard and Yale sponsorship was fully justified would be to speak
tamely. Our students and faculty pronounced him the best of the season, and we had
an extensive and varied program of lecturers and entertainers.""

GEORGE M. MILLER, Professor of English, University of Idaho:
""Of all men who have been students of the great ballad authorities, I believe that
you have done more than any other to increase the general interest in folk song.""

JOHN W. BARTON, Vice-President, Ward-Belmont School, Nashville, Tenn.:
""I am writing this to tell you just how thoroughly our girls enjoyed your recent
visit here, and what a rare treat they received from your lecture on the cowboy and
his songs. You are keeping alive in a very fine way one of the real American traditions.""

H.Y. Benedict, President University of Texas:
""Out of a great and authentic mass of material he selects with admirable judgement that which is amusing, interesting, and instructive.  Despite the patience with which he has amassed his sources, his cowboy stuff bears not the brands of the closed study but of the open ranges.""
E.D. Jennings, Dean of Southern Methodist University:
""I was immediately struck with your natural, pleasing and effective voice and found myself surprised at your ability to imitate the cowboys not only in their songs, but also in their crooning and whooping.  I never fully realized the poetic beauty of the songs until I heard you repeat them with such accuracy and melody.""
Mrs. Karle Wilson Baker, Nacogdoches, Texas:
""Few programs that I have heard carry so rich a content in so happy a vehicle of pure entertainment.""
T.D. Hobart, President Panhandle-Plains Historical Society:
""I do not think that I halfway expressed to you the appreciation of our Society for the wonderful assistance you gave at the banquet of the Pandhandle-Plains Historical Society.""
J. Frank Dobie, English Department, University of Texas:
""Lomax is doing for the balladry of America what one Percy did for the ballad literature of Britain.  And as Percy remains the ballad curator of Britain, so does Lomax retain his preeminence as preserver of American folk-poetry.""
L.H. Hubbard, President of the Texas State College for Women, Denton:
""You gave us a new conception of the importance of ballad literature in the Southwest, and the artistic manner in which you presented the subject recreated for your listeners the life on the plains in a peculiarly vivid manner.""
Mrs. T. A. Armstrong, President of the Waco Press Club:
""Hard-riding centaurs, herding migrating cattle among the cacti, gallop across imagination's stage so plainly that it becomes unbelievable that they are conjured up by the professional gentleman who stands talking alone behind the lecture table in wing collar and drawing-room clothes.""
E. E. Davis, Dean of the North Texas Agricultural College:
""I have heard dozens of students and practically all of the faculty people express their appreciation for the fine entertainment you gave.  It went over as a one hundred percent success.""
Cullen P. Thomas, Dallas:
""For three-quarters of an hour, without a dull moment, I was charmed with your interpretation of cowboy life and literature.""
Sam Acheson, in Dallas News:
""His appearances in forty-three states and in most of the important universities have earned John A. Lomax an enviable reputation as an interpreter of perhaps the saltiest and most vital of all American folk art.""

Mr. Engel has passed me your note to him of the twelfth, confirming the suggestion made in conversation that you should, for a time, serve as Honorary Conservator of our Archive of American Folk-Song, incidentally continuing with our machine, at your own expense, to record and collect material in the field and, while in Washington, assisting in the response to inquiries involving the Archive itself.

The services will be most appropriate and is very welcome to us, and in our report, now being prepared for submission to Congress, we shall be gratified to refer to it as a disinterested contribution to a valuable section of the work of our Music Division, including you in the list of Honorary Consultants and as Honorary Curator of this particular archive.

Your note accords further permission to the Library to make copies of any of the material in this field which you have heretofore personally accumulated.  In so far as our resources permit us to take advantage of this, we shall certainly appreciate it.

Mr. Carl Engel, Director,
Division of Music,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I met Mr. Lorax last week in New York, and we talked over many things, he asked
me to have the recording instrument returned here for checking over etc.  This
morning I received a letter from him, written in West Virginia, confirming this.
I have asked the Return Loads Bureau to pick up the instrument complete as follows:
1 case recording unit                                          [*1 Dictaphone No 14744 O*]
1 case amplifier unit                                           [*24 Records*]
1 case 3 cells of Edison Batteries
1 case 3 cells of Edison Batteries
1 microphone suspended on stand
1 50 feet lenghth of cable.

A copy of this letter goes to the Return Loads Bureau. They will have a truck leaving Washington for New York on Monday and another later in the week. They will handle everything very carefully, especially the microphone. I trust this action meets with your approval.

I have not been able to get to Washington to give your organization a demonstration, but will do this sometime with one of my regular instruments.

I have not been able to find the metal record you made at the studio, but have found the one made on celluloid. I am going to make another search for it however, and if it  is found, I will deliver it to your New York office.

Very truly yours,
W.C. Garwick

Detroit, Michigan

Dear Mr. Lomax:

The machine, records, and all that goes with it, have been sent
to Mr. Garwick in New York. It was my belief that you were going
to make further tests under Mr. Garwick's supervision. He does not
think that he can come to Washington in the immediate future.

Naturally, I want you to use the machine, if it helps to procure 
records for the Library. At this moment I do not quite see out 
of what fund or appropriation we can cover the charges for transportation 
to Texas,  but I'll look into it. I presume you will let me
have a definite address by return mail. 

I am supposed to see Mr. Leland one of these days, but since a 
date has not yet been set for our interview and it may suffer delay,
you might write to him directly, telling him what you have in mind,
also pointing out the interest that the Linguistic Atlas people are
taking in out Archive of American Folk-Song.

It seems to me that your letter of Nov. 18 must have consisted 
of more than two sheets. I can not see any connection between the
bottom of the first and the top of the second. This may have resulted
in my reply being vague and incomplete.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

My dear Sir:
   
Dr. Bixby, Assistant Director of Prisons, has forwarded 
to me your request for information relative to Folk
Songs among inmates of penal institutions.
   
I have made careful inquiry among the men here and
have had the man in charge of the band make further inquiry,
and it seems that we have no such songs current in
this institution.
   
It would appear to me that the songs really prevalent
are those songs of passing popularity which come to us over
the radio. It would appear to me that the advent of radio 
in penal institutions will have the effect of eliminating 
the type of songs of which you inquire.

John A. Lomax, Esq.
c/o Orin Calloway
Comanche, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Your letter of Dec. 31 was forwarded to me to New York and had to
travel back with me. Hence the delay in my reply.

The offer of Mr. David Stephens, on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation,
is most gratifying and fills me, of course, with elation; especially
the thought that provision could be made for the support of yourself and
your research during a number of years.

I do not know whether you have been advised that, in the meantime, the
Carnegie Corporation has favorably acted upon your application, and that Dr.
Kapellmeister informed Dr. Putnam that the sum of three thousand dollars had been
voted for this project, the money to be paid through the Library of Congress.

It would seem a pity if the Carnegie grant should be lost because of the
Rockefeller offer, or vice versa. And yet it would see, necessary to ascertain
at once how high a stipend the Rockefeller Foundation would be likely
to vote and for how many years. The Carnegie grant is for one year only, at
present. It might conceivably be arranged to have the Carnegie money apply
to the inevitable needs for equipment, clerical help, and similar things,
if the Stephens offer would take care of your personal needs. I must confess
that, while it is my hope and wish to see you personally freed from all
obligations so that you can devote yourself freely and entirely to your work,
I view our project as a whole of even greater dimensions. I should like to
see the possibility of really establishing and conducting a department of
American folk-song in the Library, with possibly other workers in the field,
under your direction, exploring other regions than those in which you are
preeminently at home.

If the importance of this whole project can be sufficiently impressed
upon the authorities of the two foundations, perhaps we may obtain the means
of salvaging, at practically the last minute, much of what otherwise might
be irretrievably lost.

It would have been helpful could we have discussed these problems here;
but so long as you are not likely to be in Washington within the near future,
I shall appreciate your writing me fully what you think we better do about
the Carnegie grant and the Rockefeller offer.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

Division of Music,
Library of Congress,

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have just sent you and Mr. Putnam the
following wire:

""Mr. Stevens made offer without the application
from me; thereupon I informed him of Carnegie's
application, he making no comment. His letter today
says that he would see Mr. Leland Friday. Please
communicate with these gentlemen and wire whether
my presence in Washington would be helpful. Matter
important enough to warrant this sacrifice. Both
grants could be wisely utilized for field work until
collection further enlarged. Writing fully.""

This telegram was written mainly in reply to
a letter received this morning from Mr. Putnam, who
seems to be under the impression that I had sought
Mr. Stevens and applied to him for aid from The
Rockefeller Foundation, in addition to my application
to The Carnegie Corporation. As I recall, I
wrote you fully that Mr. Stevens, (by the way, I
spelled his name wrong in my first letter) came and
made the proffer of supporting me for from three to
five years on the project, not only in the matter of
expenses but in providing maintenance of my family.
He asked me in particular about my dependents and
other obligations incumbent upon me, saying that he
wanted me to be without financial worry during the
progress of this work. I then told him about my
application to The Carnegie Corporation, how it had
come about and also that you and Mr. Leland were [further]
informed concerning it. To this Mr. Stevens made no
response.

Under date of January 2nd, Mr. Stevens writes
me: ""I have read your note of December 31st [*/*] with

discussion concerning your immediate need of bettering
facilities for your field work. I see that you
ask for as much as $350.00 for the proper equipment
of your automobile. I understand that you are at
once having the work done and wish to furnish receipted
bills. I expect to see Mr. Leland on Friday of this
week and then can in more detail take up your more
extended interest in further studies of the same character
as those you now are carrying on for the Library
of Congress.""

You can understand that the ideal arrangement for
me would be the one proposed by Mr. Stevens. Now that
The Carnegie Corporation has agreed to advance the
funds necessary for expenses, I am wondering if Mr.
Stevens would be satisfied for for the present, at least,
to advance only what is required in addition for the
maintenance of my family. Since Mr. Putnam seems to
think in his letter of January 6th to me, that some
complication may arise in this matter, my own opinion
is that we should clear up this point immediately,
either through you or through Mr. Leland. On the same
day that I wrote to you, I also sent a similar letter
to Mr. Leland, to which he has not as yet replied.

In my wire, as you will also see, I suggested
that if necessary, I could come to Washington. I
should, however, regret very much to make the journey
because of the expense and time involved unless the
project was seriously imperilled and my presence there
could aid in clarifying the situation.

I note what you say concerning the extension of
the work in other fields. In think in a little time
that we can get larger movements started and I am
naturally very pleased at your suggestion that
I should direct the work. Mr. Stevens told me, by
the way, that in my project I ""was working down his
alley;"" that he was intensely interested in seeing
the job thoroughly done. Through him I think you can
hope to expect very much.

In order to save time, I am sending a copy of
this letter to Mr. Putnam and am also enclosing herewith
a copy of a letter that I am writing Mr. Stevens
in reply to his favor of January 2nd.

Dear Dr. Lomax: 
Your day letter of the 9th reached me promptly, and on the
11th came your note of the same day with the copy of the one to
Mr. Engel.  If I withheld an immediate reply, it was because I 
thought that I should be hearing from Dr. Stevens.  I have no from
him a copy of his note to you of the 11th.
So far as the Rockefeller grant is concerned that quite
clears it.  I suppose that the grant from the Carnegie Corporation
should be similarly cleared, but assume that this will be the care
of Dr. Leland who was an intermediary in regard to it.
Possibly Dr. Stevens himself may have had a word with Dr.
Keppel, as is, I think, quite the practice between the two foundations 
where a cooperation is suggested.
We of course greatly welcome not merely the assurance but 
the enlarged and extended prospect offered by the Rockefeller grant.
It is an important confirmation of the significance of the undertaking.
Assuming the Carnegie grant to stand, we shall have to consider 
in what form it is to be made available to you.  One way would
of course be for you to report periodically your outlays for the preceding 
period, we then transmitting to you a remittance to cover them.
Another way would be for us at the beginning of the period to advance
the sum which you estimate will cover the expenses for the subsequent
period.  Please let us have your preference.
Where disbursements are made for an expense account rendered
we have to regard the regulations of the General Accounting Office,
which require itemized statements and even vouchers: including, for
instance, receipts for gasoline purchases, stubs of Pullman checks
where Pullmans are used, receipts for repairs to car if those are a
proper debit, etc.  How far we may be able to relax any such requirements 
proving inconvenient to you will appear in connection with the
first transaction.  It would, however, be prudent from the start to
preserve an itemized record so the details may be available if called
for.
Faithfully yours,

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I wrote you in St. Louis on December 31st giving you an account of the conversation which Mr. David H. Stevens had had with me regarding my work of collecting folk songs. As I told you then,he sought this conference, made the proposals that I outlined to you, whereupon I told him the entire situation as I knew it. I came on back to Texas and was notified by you and Mr. Putnam that the Carnegie people had granted me expense money for one year.

On January 8th Mr. Stevens wrote me saying that an amount of $350.00 had been allotted me to equip my car for conveniently carrying the machinery, batteries, etc., and for equipping it with electrical appliances that would charge the battery as we drove along. These outlays were for the purpose of expediting the work;in the same letter [manner] Mr. Stevens wrote me, ""Through Mr. Leland I learned that routine of your further work under the Library of Congress is issued from other source. I am greatly pleased to learn this. I shall be as much interested in your results as though we had gone further in our discussions of possible aid from this source.""

On January 11th he write in addition, ""I fully understand that the program that you have in hand is being extended by an other organization and that our discussions in St. Louis were entirely on the basis of that expectation."" In this letter statement Mr. Stevens goes further than was my understanding at St. Louis. At that time, it was not known that the Carnegie grant would come. I simply tbld him that I had put in an application. He made no reply. Mr. Stevens himself first proposed a grant to last from three to five years and in an amount that would, in addition to expenses, furnish income for the support of my two children. He specifically asked about my responsibilities. Of course, that offer coming to me unsolicited was ideal. I at once wrote to you regarding the offer and I think also to Mr. Leland. I am writing now to you simply to give you the complete record as I know it.

I enclose you herewith a letter that I have sent to Mr. Stevens, acknowledging two communications from him.

Yours very truly,

Dear Mr. Stevens:
I note from your letter of January 8th that a maximum amount of $350.00 will be available for equipping my automobile conveniently for the work in collecting negro folk songs and other types of indigenous American ballads that we may run across on our journey. For example, we are spending a few days soon in Southwest Texas getting the records of the singing of American Mexican peons who have ""made-up"" songs about their life on the Texas frontier (Spanish).
I note that you wish me to send receipted bills for such expenses as we incur to Mr. George J. Beal, Comptroller of the Foundation, as a basis for payments to me. I hope it will be in perfectly good taste for me to say that after our talk in St. Louis I very much hoped that my further prosecution of this work would be in association with you. You were kind and generous in your attitude and you held out the hope that the period of aid might extend over some three or five years until a fairly complete collection was made.
As the matter stands, I am only promised help for a single year and that on quite a different basis from what you suggested. At least I shall always recall with very great pleasure the fact that your proposal came to me unsolicited and in a manner that relieved me from all possible embarrassment.
Mr. Garwick has written and asked me to send him one of our master records of negro singing so that he can make a copy to give you as a present. I should be very glad to have you indicate any song that you heard Alan play in the hotel room that especially appealed to you. You need not limit the number to one, I will see that additional copies are made if you desire them in your own collection.

With kind regards, I am
Sincerely yours,

I am drawing at once upon the Carnegie Corporation for the actual 
remittance of the sum voted, or at least one-fourth of it to cover the
first quarterly instalment.  Immediately upon receipt of it, which should
not be delayed, we shall be sending you a check for that amount,- $750.
This is in accordance with your preference to have the first advance cover

A fortnight before the conclusion of that period, you had better
remind us that a second instalment should follow.
As to the report of disbursements:  We quite appreciate the impracticability

the itinerary covered, and (2) the major items of disbursement, supplying

                Yours of the 2nd from Austin.
                A check from the Carnegie Corporation for the $3,000 has
just been received.  I am, therefore, authorizing the Disbursing
Officer to forward to you a remittance of $750 in anticipation of
the outlay for the first quarter.
               As to the frank:  It would be quite suitable in any communication
to us here, but might be questioned if used by you in
the field to other correspondents in the field.  Any such question had better be avoided, even to the disadvantage of the fund.
                As you may have occasion not merely to write to us but to
forward some batches of material, I am enclosing twenty penalty labels
which will bring them clear of postage.  They have merely to 
be pasted on to any envelope of package.

                                                                      Very sincerely yours,

have been on the go almost constantly, lecturing ten times in seven different
states.  These lectures* I had promised early last fall, one of them
to the William Vaughan Moody Foundation of the University of Chicago.  I 
might say that at every place my introducer told of my connection with the
Library of Congress and its project to gather American folk-songs in a 
recorded form-- a fine advertisement for the project, and, heaven knows, we
need all the leads we can get.  Mack Evans choirmaster of the University of
Chicago, has begged us to send him a recording of some fine group singing
among the Negroes so that he may try it out with his music groups.

The Los Pastores, native Mexican folk play about the birth
of Christ, is very long, lasting three, four, sometimes five hours.  Even
though we could delete part of the dialogue in recording it, the whole affair
would be quite expensive.  And so, within the week, I am sending you a 
few samples of the music that we recorded in South Texas.  If you find that
interesting enough to justify the recording of the whole folk opera, it 
will be easy enough, I think, to stage a performance.  the Texas Folk Lore
Society meets here in three weeks and through them we can discover where
the Pastores is preserved most purely by oral tradition.

I have a great many things that I want to write you about
soon.  Be sure to send me a half dozen copies of the Musical Quarterly 
when it comes off the press.

JohnA. Lomax,

My dear Dr. Lomax:

Your note of April 3rd reached me duly, and Mr. Engel has
told me of one to him.

The letters, identical in form with that to the Lieutenant
Governor of Texas, were sent off a couple of days ago addressed to
the Governors of the four states you mentioned, that is, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.  As I did not know your precise
itinerary, I fear that they will reach the recipients considerably
ahead of your visits to them.  However, as you did not suggest that
they be delayed or sent to you for later transmittal, we did not 
hold them back.

As to Representative Kleberg, Mr. Engel understood that you
had already been in touch with his brother in direct charge of the
ranch and were getting all the facilities that you needed, so that
in talking with the Representative he thought it necessary to no
more than express our sense of the importance of the field, and 
appreciation of the courtesies granted.

Brought into existence by John A. Lomax and L. W. Payne, Jr., in 1909,
the Texas Folk-Lore Society has come to its twenty-fifth birthday.  It is
fitting that the annual dinner this year, on Friday night, April 20, should 
in its flow of soul be directed towards the founders of the Society.  Quite
possibly not everything at this feast will be as reasonable as the price of it.
No matter—let's pile on the dog.  No fools, no fun.  All friends and members
of the Society are eligible to a plate of chuck, but everybody who 
eats will have to pay or get somebody to pay for him.

Six-bits around.

Make reservations by the morning of April 20, either by writing the
treasurer of the Society, Marcelle L. Hamer, University Station, Austin
or telephoning her at 20267.  The secretary will also make reservations
at the usual commission.

My dear Mr. Kleberg:
✓ 
Professor John A. Lomax, Honorary Custodian of our Archive
of American Folk-Song in the Library of Congress, has written to
me of his interesting visits to your King Ranch.  Professor Lomax,
as he may have told you, is collecting folk-song material for the
Library.  He and his son, Alan, are making recordings for us on a 
machine specially constructed for the purpose.  His recordings,
made so far, have proved of unusual interest and value to scholars
and students of folk literature and folk music.

Mr. Lomax seems especially anxious to attend the Spring
round-up at the King Ranch this year, with a view to have some of 
the Mexican ""cowpokes"" make recordings.  This note is merely 
intended to emphasize the scientific merit of Mr. Lomax's work, and to ask
for your kind assistance when he presents himself.  Your courtesy 
will be greatly appreciated by the Library.

Faithfully yours,

Librarian

P.S. Under separate cover I am sending you a copy of the ""Musical
Quarterly"" for April 1934 where on pages 177 to 187 you will find 
a characteristic article of Mr. Lomax's.  A book recently finished
by him will shortly be published by the Macmillan Company in New

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS

May 14, 1934.

Mr. John A. Lomax,
University Station,
Austin, Texas.

Dear Sir:

Several weeks ago, at your request, I examined a phonograph recording
system which you had been using, the examination being for the purpose of
learning why the equipment functioned unsatisfactorily. Upon examination I
found the following conditions:
        
1. The amplifier was of very poor design, not embodying the best principles 
of current practice. The power tubes were connected in parallel, not
in push-pull, and this connection seriously reduced the low frequency response 
and increased the distortion.

2. The transformers used in the amplifier were of very poor quality

4. The wiring has been very poorly done. Soldered connections were
improperly made, resulting in joints that would fail easily and thus cause

Dear Mr. Engel:

We are here in the midst

Negroes and Poor whites, all of
whom seem to have distinct
Ballad cultures (if there is such).
We are really embarrassed by
the quantity of material offered
us, our object, of course, being

Tonight we go far off the beaten
track to attend a dance

Letter to Mr. Engel from
Prof. John A. Lomax

Mr. Lomax, under date of June 7, has written to me from Crowley,
La. After an account of his latest trips and trials, he says:

""On July 5 I am to be married . . . Having a home once 
more for my dear little daughter and Alan raises the question 
of where it would be best to live. In case support
can be continued for the collection of folk songs and in
case you are satisfied with my work, would you prefer that
I live in Washington or say in Austin, Texas, at the University? 
Wherever this home is, I as a field worker must stay
in the field. So long as I am in the field Texas is nearer
to more folk songs than is Washington. In this connection I
should also like for you to consider my appointment as Archivist 
rather than merely as an Honorary. If this is not the
proper time to bring up such matters or should you prefer for
any other reason not to discuss them, please pass up this section 
of my letter.""

There would seem to be good reason why the question raised by Mr.
Lomax should now be brought to your attention rather than at some later
time. Proper arrangements, looking toward to the future of our folk song
archive, should be made at as early a time as possible.

Mr. Lomax stresses the point that he is primarily a ""field worker.""
As such his work unquestionably is of value. But we need someone, resident 
in Washington, to administer the archive. If Mr. Lomax (whose heart
is evidently with the University of Austin) should not care to live here,
he might still be considered for the position of Archivist, provided an
able assistant, permanently in residence here, would attend to the administrative 
details.

There is one consideration, however, which we should bear in mind:
with Mr. Lomax's avowed preference for field work and with his obvious
inclination to restrict his work to the Southern states, he would not be
in a position to direct the work of the Archive such as we have conceived
it. There should be someone in charge of the whole enterprise who will
not only attend to the necessary correspondence from here, but who will
be able to direct other workers in other regions than those covered by
Mr. Lomax, so that the entire country may eventually be canvassed.

Only with some such comprehensive plan should we go gunning for more
and larger funds.

Dear Mr. Engel:

I have your memorandum of the 11th, referring to
certain suggestions in the letter from Dr. Lomax dated June 7th.

I quite concur with your comments. On the other
hand, it is quite  clear that no appropriation for the coming
year will be available for service in connection with the Folk
Song Project. I shall of course repeat in the estimates for the 
following year the request for the subordinate position. I see
no prospect, however, that I could expect to secure a more substantial 
salary requisite for the position of Director of the
Archive, which is, I suppose, what Dr. Lomax would have in mind.

Until the conclusion of the grant to him for the
service in the field, I do not, therefore, see any way of assigning 
to him a place upon our regular roll, or a compensation.
There would seem no propriety in dropping the honorary.

I am returning herewith your son Alan's interesting notes.
Some of these ditties that he refers to I should be interested
to see and hear. You are certainly making good progress.

The publishers who print the ""Arizona Home"" which they
claim has been infringed by all the publishers who have issued
different versions of ""Home on the Range"", now have brought suit.
I know that you have had some correspondence or conferences  in
this matter, and I wonder whether you could shed any additional
light on this controversy. Have you at any time run across the
tune and words in your ramblings down South? Or could you say
with authority that you heard the tune and words before 1904?

This case should form an interesting test of what constitutes
a ""folk song"" and how it originates.

Tunes to help with work:

One Sunday in June on the Darrington State Prison Farm in 
Texas we recorded twenty of these tunes. The singing was done
by our long time friend, Lightning, by Dave Tippin and three
other chosen singers. While they sing, they chopped with their
axes or their hoes, depending on the sort of a work tune they
happened to be singing. The titles of some of these tunes:
Long John, Stewball (the racehorse), Great Godamighty, Black
Gal, Go Down Hannah, John Henry, All Night Long, and etc..
The manner of their singing is typical of work songs as we
have heard them sung in prisons throughout the deep South.
One spiritual and one jazz tune turned work-songs among them,
""Ef you don' git to singin', boy, you sho git worried.""

Tunes to help religion:

Oh, Mount Zion-- A jubilee from the Darrington Farm which tells
of Brother Norah's building of the ark.
Reverend Sin Killer Griffin came to the Darrington Farm the
Sunday we were there and while he preached and led his convict
congregation in singing we recorded. It is hard to say where
in a Negro service singing stops and speaking begins. The
congregation moans and groans while someone is praying or making
his 'termination known. The preacher, if he is moved, chants
his sermon. The earnest worshipper chants his improvised prayer.
We recorded enough of each part of the service to make a legitimate 
record of the whole. The whole service, of course, took
place inside the barred prison dormitory. The microphone went
in with the minister behind the great black black bars,

Some months ago we came across E.A. McIlhenny's book ""Befo' De
War Spirituals"" and resolved to go to Avery Island where
he lived and record th slave-time spirituals from the singing
of the two old women, former slaves, from whom he had collected 
his material. This we have just done, and, although we
were a little disappointed in the singing of Becky and Berta,
we believe we have got a valuable record of the way spirituals
were sung ""before de war."" Ten of their most typical tunes were
recorded.

text\afc1933001_ms017_017.txt,"Spanish Tunes

Miss Jovita Gonzales of St. Mary's Hall, one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican border folk-lore, trained her sadly
Anglo-Saxon pupils to sing twenty of the game-songs, nursery
rhymes, etc., that she had learned as a child on a ranch at
the border of Texas and Mexico. She was forced to use Anglo-
Saxon children because none of the little Mexican girls in
St. Mary's Hall would take time to learn them. Some of
these rhymes are Spanish in origin, some Mexican, some of
mixed parentage. Some of the melodies are very fine.

In Little Mexico in San Antonio we found a group of Mexican
children who consented to sing for us their game-songs. The
record they made, of eight tunes, some of them modern as the
telephone , some ancient as the Moor's conquest, was particularly 
fine.

Near one of the oldest Missions about San Antonio we brought together 
a group of country folk one afternoon. There we
recorded thirteen love-songs and ballads which so far as we,
Miss Gonzales and our informants knew had never hitherto been
recorded.

I might remark at this point that the Library will be able
easily to get together a large collection of Mexican folk-tunes
sung in the proper manner from the recordings of commercial
concerns. Thousands of records are pressed and scores of
thousands sold of the indigenous, popular tunes, ballads and
love-songs. Whether there are many types of Tex-Mex folk-

(We are now at work in the Cajun country, a region that
extends roughly from the border of Texas to the Mississippi
through the extreme southern part of Louisiana along
the old Spanish trail. It was settled, as sentimentally
recorded in Longfellow's ""Evangeline"", by the French refugees 
from Acadia [in] or Nova Scotia in Canada. They have
preserved remarkably untouched until the present generation 
of school children their own dialects, customs and
music. The music that is played at dances in this country,
usually by a fiddle, guitar and accordion band is quite
remarkable and most certainly indigenous. Some of the best
of it has been recorded by Victor and Columbia in the last
five years and these records have sold well both in their
own country and in Canada. Since all the native bands
have become money-conscious, no matter how bad they may be,
and since they think we are trying to make records of their
playing for commercial purposes, since the best of it has 
been recorded, we have neglected the accordion orchestras. )

Instead we have interested ourselves more in the French ballad
survivals and the lyrics indigenous to the country.

One ballad of the whore-house with a fine melody,

Twenty-four French ballads and Cajun lyrics which are at
present being transcribed by a folk-lorist acquainted with the
dialect of the region.

Four fiddle tunes, two square-dances, one mazurka and on [walt] 
waltz.

Two tunes played by the St. Martinsville band (the town 
where Evangeline is buried), which plays entirely by ear.
(We would like to remark here that the recording of this
band, more a test of our new recording outfit than anything
else, made in the open streets, with a large crowd of onlookers,
was entirely satisfactory, whereas previous attempts
with our discarded Garwick set had been just the reverse.)

We have, of course, spent a great deal of our time, in fact
the most of it, in other pursuits than making records. In the
first place it is a slow job to locate an informant who [sin]
sings well and at the same time knows what we want. Most of
our trips are thus fruitless. Then we have, as well as
recorded mechanically, written out the texts of many songs
and noted down the reccurence of tunes we had before recorded.
Lastly, we make rather feeble attempts to set down
on paper what neither the camera nor the recording machine
can catch, that is: the environment out of which the songs
grew and the people who sing the. This last is an endless
task, of course.

Just how successful our photographs of singers in action [wil]

but none have been returned from Austin where they [e]

Dear Lomax:

I was much interested in getting a letter on July 12 
from Mr. Strunk, of the Division of Music, Library of Congress, concerning 
the possibility of securing the cooperation of his division 
in the Modern Language Association's plan to encourage and systematize 
the collection of folk songs. He wrote a good letter and expressed 
himself as being glad to do anything that he could.

I was particularly pleased that you are now the 
Honorary Consultant and Curator. I was on the eve of writing to you 
when your letter of July 19 was received. I certainly appreciate 
your writing so promptly and so helpfully and am glad to know that 
you had some thing to do with the action of the Modern Language Association 
last December. As you so well point out, the two chief 
problems are those of coordinating existing efforts and of financing 
the whole endeavor.

I am corresponding with various agencies and organizations 
on the first of these points, that of cooperation, and am 
receiving most appreciate and promising replies.

On the Central Committee of the Modern Language 
Association, there are Phillips Barry, of Cambrige, Miss Martha 
Beckwith, of Vassar, and Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr., of Virginia. I am 
wondering if you have any suggestions for the representative of 
the mid-West. I believe it would be a fine thing for you to be on this 
Central Committee also in order to tie [tighten] in more closely with the 
Library of Congress and your existing work. If you will agree, I 
will put your name on the Committee at once. 

There is already a cooperating committee from the 
Southeaster Modern Language Association, which covers the ballad producing 
states of the South. I have also written to the American Folk-Lore 
Society and feel sure that they will appoint a cooperating committee.

```UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA GRADUATE SCHOOL COLUMBIA, S. C. REED SMITH DEAN July 24, 1934 Mr. John A. Lomax University Station Austin, Texas Dear Lomax: I was much interested in getting a letter on July 12 from Mr. Strunk, of the Division of Music, Library of Congress, concerning the possibility of securing the cooperation of his division in the Modern Language Association's plan to encourage and systematize the collection of folk songs. He wrote a good letter and expressed himself as being glad to do anything that he could. I was particularly pleased that you are now the Honorary Consultant and Curator. I was on the eve of writing to you when your letter of July 19 was received. I certainly appreciate your writing so promptly and so helpfully and am glad to know that you had some thing to do with the action of the Modern Language Association last December. As you so well point out, the two chief problems are those of coordinating existing efforts and of financing the whole endeavor. I am corresponding with various agencies and organizations on the first of these points, that of cooperation, and am receiving most appreciate and promising replies. On the Central Committee of the Modern Language Association, there are Phillips Barry, of Cambrige, Miss Martha Beckwith, of Vassar, and Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr., of Virginia. I am wondering if you have any suggestions for the representative of the mid-West. I believe it would be a fine thing for you to be on this Central Committee also in order to tie [tighten] in more closely with the Library of Congress and your existing work. If you will agree, I will put your name on the Committee at once.

Cookeville, Tennessee
My dear Professor Rickard,
I have your letter of the 20th, telling me of
your interest in the songs and dances of the Tennessee
Mountains and asking me what aid the Library of Congress
can give you in this work.
The Library of Congress is vitally interested in 
the collecting of American folk-song and the formation
of a great central collection of such material.  With
these ends in view, there has been established within the
Library an “Archive of American Folk-Song.”  At the present
time the work of the “Archive” is being directed by Mr.
John A. Lomax, Honorary Consultant and Curator.  May I
suggest, then, that you write to Mr. Lomax, who is
already acquainted with your work, addressing him at
University Station, Austin, Texas.  In the meantime, I
shall send Mr. Lomax a copy of your letter.
Very sincerely yours,

your recent wire and of your letters of the 6th and 8th.
Your report I have forwarded to Mr. Engel, who will make
the necessary cuts and changes. I am sorry to have had

Dear Sir:

I am collecting for the Library of Congress the words and tunes of songs or ballads current and popular among prisoners, or ""made up"" by them and passed around by ""word of mouth"" rather than by the printed page. Many of these songs - though by no means all of them - relate to experiences in prison, to the life of criminals in jail or in the ""free world"". They grow in length or change verbally as they are passed around. I wish to secure copies of them all, no matter how crude or vulgar they may be. Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine. The material I wish to secure is especially plantiful among Negro prisoners.

Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me know whether such songs are current among the persons under your charge? May I also ask you to forward to me at this time the words of those songs that are available, with such remarks and suggestions as might be helpful? Even short scraps will be welcome.

This proposal is part of a plan of the Library of Congress to collect and make available to properly qualified students the words and music of all American folk songs.

I shall greatly appreciate a reply to this communication. 

Sincerely yours,

Honorary Curator and Consultant in Folk Song.

Compliance with the above request will be a service to the Library of Congress, and appreciated

Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine. The material I wish to secure is especially plantiful among Negro prisoners. Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me know whether such songs are current among the persons under your charge? May I also ask you to forward to me at this time the words of those songs that are available, with such remarks and suggestions as might be helpful? Even short scraps will be welcome. This proposal is part of a plan of the Library of Congress to collect and make available to properly qualified students the words and music of all American folk songs. I shall greatly appreciate a reply to this communication. Sincerely yours, Honorary Curator and Consultant in Folk Song.

John A. Lomax, Esq.

Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Let me begin by acknowledging, with thanks, your letters of September 
9, 10, and 14, also your wire of September 19, the contents of which has
been incorporated in your report for the year. I should have written more
promptly had I not been away from Washington during the ten days beginning
September 15. Returning on the 24th, I determined to attend to your circular
letter before writing. Hence the delay.

As to this circular letter, Dr. Putnam has approved the text and added
a word of endorsement, and the Government Printing Office is ready to begin
work. Dr. Putnam's signature will appear in facsimile; I assume that you
too will prefer not to sign each letter individually. May I ask you, therefore,
to send me a sheet of white paper bearing several specimens of your
signature in black ink in order that a good facsimile may be made? I am
having the letter done on stationery similar to that printed several years
ago for Mr. Gordon and headed:

Library of Congress
Division of Music
Archive of American Folk-Song.

I expect to send you some of this stationery shortly; if I am unable to  find
the remainder of the old stock I shall have a new lot printed.

Your reference to the directory published last June by the American
Prison Association saved me much time and trouble. We hae a copy here, and
I note that it covers both the United States and Canada. There will, then,
be no need of going beyond this pamphlet for addresses.

I assume that you will want us to mail these letters from Washington and
forward replies to you as they come in.

I am glad to know that Professor Smith has asked you to serve on his
Central Committee and should think that you would accept as a matter of course.
My first thought on reading your suggestion that I also serve was that I might
perhaps further the Committee's work more effectively as an outsider than as a 
member. Yesterday, however, I received a second invitation, this time from
Professor Boggs of North Carolina, Chairman of the Folklore Section of the MLA,
and on reconsidering the matter I have decided to accept. Assuming that you
were responsible for this second invitation, as well as for the first, I thank
you for both.

I am writing today to Professor Boggs, also to Professor Smith;

Dear Professor Lomax
I should have answered your letter of September 9 some time ago, but the rush of the opening weeks of the University year with unexpected increase in enrollment that has about snowed us under, and also the necessity of my making week-end trips and writing numerous letters in an attempt to bring in the many bits of promised material from my last summer's trip have together forced such matters to await a breathing spell.

I appreciate very much the information you sent regarding the sound-recording machine you used. The price of $450 is about the same as I received from several manufactures with whom I communicated. That was more than the money I had available would cover, so I had to resort to hand-recording, which, of course, is not very satisfactory.

The possibility of having the loan of the Library of Congress recording machine at a later time is a very pleasant prospect for me. I shall not be able to go out lore hunting again until next summer when I would like to continue this work. I have located a number of ""singers"" about the Great Lakes region who seemingly have large stores  of old songs which should be recorded before it is too late to get them. I also have the names of a number of lumberjack singers who are said to have a considerable repertoire. I shall write you later when my plans are more definite.

Sincerely yours,
Ivan H. Walton

```University of Michigan Please return 1506 Golden Avenue Ann Arbor, Michigan October 14, 1934 Professor John A. Lomax Route 4, Box 341, Forest Hills Dallas, Texas Dear Professor Lomax I should have answered your letter of September 9 some time ago, but the rush of the opening weeks of the University year with unexpected increase in enrollment that has about snowed us under, and also the necessity of my making week-end trips and writing numerous letters in an attempt to bring in the many bits of promised material from my last summer's trip have together forced such matters to await a breathing spell. I appreciate very much the information you sent regarding the sound-recording machine you used. The price of $450 is about the same as I received from several manufactures with whom I communicated. That was more than the money I had available would cover, so I had to resort to hand-recording, which, of course, is not very satisfactory. The possibility of having the loan of the Library of Congress recording machine at a later time is a very pleasant prospect for me. I shall not be able to go out lore hunting again until next summer when I would like to continue this work. I have located a number of ""singers"" about the Great Lakes region who seemingly have large stores of old songs which should be recorded before it is too late to get them. I also have the names of a number of lumberjack singers who are said to have a considerable repertoire. I shall write you later when my plans are more definite. Sincerely yours, Ivan H. Walton IHW:M PS I am anxiously awaiting the appearance of your book.```",What did I use to resort to the sound-?,What is the name of the name of the book that is not able to be able

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Strunk:

You will remember that you kindly consented to serve
on a Committee of the Modern Language Association on American Folk-Song.
The present personal of this Committee is as follows: Philips Barry,
of Cambridge, Mass.; Miss Martha Beckwith, of Vassar; Mr. W. Oliver
Strunk, Chief of the Division of Music, Library of Congress; John A.
Lomax, of Texas; Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr., of Virginia; and Reed Smith,
University of South Carolina, Chairman.

A member from the West should be added and possible
names are being considered. I should appreciate a suggestion from
you on this point.

Up to now, the work of the Committee has been confined
to corresponding on the part of the Chairman with various organizations
and persons interested in balladry and folk-song. A cooperating committee
has been appointed by the South Atlantic Modern Language Association
and will begin work at the Thanksgiving meeting of the South
Atlantic Modern Language Association. The American Folk-Lore Society
has also been asked to name a committee. As soon as Professor Franz
Boas, President of the American Folk-Lore Society, names this committee,
it will be available for consultation and work. The Music
Department of the Library of Congress through Mr. Oliver Strunk,
Chief of the Division, and Mr. John A. Lomax, Honorary Curator, will
be glad to cooperate fully.

Our field is so large and the work so tremendous that
it is difficult to know how to delimit and where to make a start. The
two things, it seems to me, we should work into first are these:

1. Discovering, listing, and collating all the folk-song
collections and folk-song collecting activities that are now being
carried on in this country. We might serve as a kind of central focus
or clearing house for all such activities and prepare a bulletin or a
catalog in order to acquaint those interested with exactly what is on
file, what is being done in the field, and how to get into touch with
the various collections and collectors. I believe it would be a useful
piece of work if it could be thoroughly and faithfully done.

Along with this could be incorporated certain individual

of Duke University to publish the large and valuable North Carolina
collection and (b) to consider whether the time has not come when an
American supplement to the big Child collection should not be issued.

2. Another thing that should be done at the first

Chairman of the Committee on Research Activities, for financial aid to
carry on the work of the Committee. The securing of this aid will, of
course, depend upon whether we can outline a sufficiently definite and
attractive program of work to induce the Committee to help us.

These are two foundation undertakings that I believe
our Committee should consider. Please think over these possibilities
that face us and write me freely your ideas and suggestions. Professor
R. S. Boggs, Chairman of the Committee on Folk-Lore, who has charge
of the program for the Folk-Lore Section of the Modern Language Association
meeting at its approaching session in Swarthmore, has listed
me for a paper on ""A Survey of Recent Activities in American Balladry,
to be followed by a report of the Committee appointed to make recommendations
concerning a proposed group project in the gathering and study
of American balladry. Discussion of and action on this report may be

I am wondering if you will attend the Swarthmore
meeting, and, if so, whether we could not have a Committee meeting
before the session of the folk-lore group and shape up a good report.
If this is impossible we will have to do it through the slower and
less satisfactory method of correspondence.

Just to let you know what I am doing

Dear Friend:

You are invited to become a charter member of the Tennessee
Folk Lore Society, and to be present at its organization, Nov. 10
(Home Coming Day), at 10:30 A.M., Room 1. Administration Building, T.P.
I. campus. If you cannot be here in person you can help by indicating
your desire for membership, sending the address of anyone else who may
also desire membership, and criticizing the enclosed constitution,
suggesting any additions or changes that you consider essential.
In the matter of annual dues, for instance, what would you favor? The
Texas Folk Lore Society charges $1.50, but some thought that might be a
little high. What do you think? In order that you may understand the 
purposes of the Society, the following explanation is made:
Perhaps no other section of the United States is so rich in folk lore
as the mountains of Tennessee, and the collection, study and preservation
of it is a very worth-while endeavor. Especially is this true now
for the activities of the T.V.A. and related governmental bodies in
fast breaking up the old native life habits and traditions of our people.
In the collection of folk lore Tennessee is backward. Several other
states have their folk lore societies, but she has none, and her educational
leaders have made no concerted effort to gather such material
and preserve it. The Tennessee Folk Lore Society is a move to remedy
this very situation. Although it has its origin on the campus of Tennessee
Polytechnic Institute, it purposes to become state-wide in scope
and membership, and through its annual meetings and publications to increase
the interest in the whole subject of folk lore. To better inform
you as to the nature of the work, we quote the following fairly adequate
definition of folk lore:
Folk lore is the traditional oral heritage of a people. It includes
songs and ballads; superstitions, signs, omens, cures and
racial or provincial customs; legends, tales, ghost stories; dialectical
words, sayings, proverbs, similes, nicknames, place names.
and in general the flavor of folk language; games, play-party songs
dances; rhymes, jokes, riddles, traditional anecdotes and yarns; 
and the vast lore of animals and plants (from a bulletin of
the Texas Folk Lore Society).
Already we have collected a considerable body of songs (not found in
beaks), play party tunes and figures, superstitious sayings, cures for
diseases without the use of medicine, calls and figures for square
dances, idiomatic or peculiar language expressions, good and bad luck
omens, ideas about planting crops, and a few buried treasure and
ghost stories. The field has hardly been touched, however, and almost
anyone by talking thought could probably aid in the work. Send in your
contributions, and join an organization which is pledged to the collection
and preservation of this interesting phase of our life.

Dear Sir:

On August 20, 1934, I wrote you a letter of inquiry regarding
my interest in songs and dances of the Tennessee mountains, of which I
have a collection, and am adding to it at odd times. You expressed an
interest in the work and told me of the ""Archive of American Folk Song""
in your division, and suggested that I write Mr. John A. Lomax. I did
so and he replied that there was no money available then, but that a
move was being made to get aid from some of the big foundations. He advised
me to keep in touch with you at times to learn how the work was
progressing.

Will you at this time tell me of the status of the work? I am especially
interested in learning what money aid may be available for the
collection of such material.

I am enclosing some sheets which explain the projected organization
of the Tennessee Folk Lore Society. If you are interested, we should be
happy to have you or any of your friends and co-workers become charter
members. It was Mr. Lomax who suggested that I form the organization
and he will tell you, if you inquire, that I and my institution are
trustworthy and capable of making the work a success. Some of the leading
educators of this state have expressed an interest in it.

October 26, 1934.

Mr. W. Oliver Strunk,
Division of Music, Library of Congress,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Friend:
You are invited to become a charter member of the Tennessee
Folk Lore Society, and to be present at its organization, Nov. 10
(Home Coming Day), at 10:30 A.M., Room 1. Administration Building, T.P.
I. campus. If you cannot be here in person you can help by indicating
your desire for membership, sending the address of anyone else who may
also desire membership, and criticizing the enclosed constitution,
suggesting any additions or changes that you consider essential.
In the matter of annual dues, for instance, what would you favor? The
Texas Folk Lore Society charges $1.50, but some thought that might be a
little high. What do you think? In order that you may understand the 
purposes of the Society, the following explanation is made:
Perhaps no other section of the United States is so rich in folk lore
as the mountains of Tennessee, and the collection, study and preservation
of it is a very worth-while endeavor. Especially is this true now
for the activities of the T.V.A. and related governmental bodies in
fast breaking up the old native life habits and traditions of our people.
In the collection of folk lore Tennessee is backward. Several other
states have their folk lore societies, but she has none, and her educational
leaders have made no concerted effort to gather such material
and preserve it. The Tennessee Folk Lore Society is a move to remedy
this very situation. Although it has its origin on the campus of Tennessee
Polytechnic Institute, it purposes to become state-wide in scope
and membership, and through its annual meetings and publications to increase
the interest in the whole subject of folk lore. To better inform
you as to the nature of the work, we quote the following fairly adequate
definition of folk lore:
Folk lore is the traditional oral heritage of a people. It includes
songs and ballads; superstitions, signs, omens, cures and
racial or provincial customs; legends, tales, ghost stories; dialectical
words, sayings, proverbs, similes, nicknames, place names.
and in general the flavor of folk language; games, play-party songs
dances; rhymes, jokes, riddles, traditional anecdotes and yarns; 
and the vast lore of animals and plants (from a bulletin of
the Texas Folk Lore Society).
Already we have collected a considerable body of songs (not found in
beaks), play party tunes and figures, superstitious sayings, cures for
diseases without the use of medicine, calls and figures for square
dances, idiomatic or peculiar language expressions, good and bad luck
omens, ideas about planting crops, and a few buried treasure and
ghost stories. The field has hardly been touched, however, and almost
anyone by talking thought could probably aid in the work. Send in your
contributions, and join an organization which is pledged to the collection
and preservation of this interesting phase of our life.

Dear Sir:

I am collecting for the Library of Congress the words and tunes of 
songs or ballads current and popular among prisoners, or ""made up"" by 
them and passed around by ""word of mouth"" rather than by the printed page.  
Many of these songs - though by no means all of them - relate to experiences 
in prison, to the life of criminals in jail or in the ""free world"".  
They grow in length or change verbally as they are passed around.  I wish 
to secure copies of them all, no matter how crude or vulgar they may be.  
Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to 
record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine.  The 
material I wish to secure is especially plentiful among Negro prisoners.

Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me 
know whether such songs are current among the persons under your charge?  
May I also ask you to forward to me at this time the words of those songs 
that are available, with such remarks and suggestions as might be helpful?  
Even short scraps will  be welcome.

This proposal is part of a plan of the Library of Congress to collect 
and make available to properly qualified students the words and music of 
all American fold-songs.

I shall greatly appreciate a reply to this communication.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax
Honorary Curator and Consultant
in American Fold-Song.

Compliance with the above request will be a service to the Library of 
Congress, and appreciated.

Many of these songs - though by no means all of them - relate to experiences 
in prison, to the life of criminals in jail or in the ""free world"".  
They grow in length or change verbally as they are passed around.  I wish 
to secure copies of them all, no matter how crude or vulgar they may be.  
Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to 
record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine.  The 
material I wish to secure is especially plentiful among Negro prisoners.

Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me

Dear Sir:

I am collecting for the Library of Congress the words and tunes of 
songs or ballads current and popular among prisoners, or ""made up"" by 
them and passed around by ""word of mouth"" rather than by the printed page.  
Many of these songs - though by no means all of them - relate to experiences 
in prison, to the life of criminals in jail or in the ""free world"".  
They grow in length or change verbally as they are passed around.  I wish 
to secure copies of them all, no matter how crude or vulgar they may be.  
Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to 
record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine.  The 
material I wish to secure is especially plentiful among Negro prisoners.

Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me 
know whether such songs are current among the persons under your charge?

Many of these songs - though by no means all of them - relate to experiences in prison, to the life of criminals in jail or in the ""free world"".

Where a visit seems justified I plan later to visit your institution to record the tunes of these songs on an electric recording machine. The material I wish to secure is especially plentiful among Negro prisoners. Will you, therefore, be good enough to make proper inquiry and let me know whether such songs are current among the persons under your charge? May I also ask you to forward to me at this time the words of those songs that are available, with such remarks and suggestions as might be helpful? Even short scraps will be welcome. This proposal is part of a plan of the Library of Congress to collect and make available to properly qualified students the words and music of all American folk-songs. I shall greatly appreciate a reply to this communication. Sincerely yours, John A. Lomax Honorary Curator and Consultant in American Folk-Song.

November 3, 1934

Mr. John A. Lomax,
General Delivery,
Atmore, Ala.

Your trouble is caused by recording at a slower speed than when the records are played back. Very likely it is caused by a slipping of the idler wheel under the lighter load of playing back, it is not slipping as much as when the recording is done. It could also be caused by a badly written idler wheel, but this is not probable. The trouble may however be that the motor bracket has slipped out of adjustment and you will find a casting that holds the motor shaft in adjustment against the idler wheel. Release the screws and move the motor toward the left (toward the idler wheel) this casting is slotted to permit this. If you move it too far it will be too tight, so it will be necessary for you to make the correctly, it is not a difficult job. You will have it correctly adjusted if the turntable does not lose speed under the pressure of your finger, this is about twice that of the cutting load. At the time I shipped this instrument to you, I sent along a little swinging gate that was to be used for obtaining the correct speed which is 78 R.P.M. This was adjusted to 78 R.P.M. under cutting load, but it was only approximately correct as the turntable travels about 79 R.P.M. when not under cutting load. If you will send this back to me I will adjust it so that the points will be a compensation for this extra revolution. It is quite important that your turntable revolves at 78 R.P.M. This is the standard speed. Several extra R.P.M. will change the pitch of the voice or music to quite a noticeable extent.

We heard from the Postmaster at Arkansas and they deny receipt of the packages. We are putting in a claim for them I feel sure that these packages were sent to Austin, as I immediately worte to them to send it on with the postage guaranteed. We sent you 25 discos 12 inch to you at Atmore, Ala. The needles are enclosed in the letter to Atmore. Your writing is not entirely clear, but we believe that it is Atmore, Ala. We are sending a copy of this letter to you at Montgomery and one to Atmore. To avoid error in the future won't you please print the shipping address.

Your professor is wrong about the pickup. It is not a cheap one. It is as good as any magnatic one on the market. It is rubber damped however, but it is possible that the rubber has become hardened or some of the internal parts have been damaged. I am now using a crystal pickup which is much lighter in weight at the needle head. It is getting much more out of the records.

pickup head.

Sometime I wish you would send just the amplifier into me so that I can go 
over it. This service will not cost you anything but I will ask you to pay 
the shipping charges.

I hear that your book is out and that it is very interesting. I must obtain 
a copy as I know I will enjoy reading it.

I just had an outfit come back that had been nine months on the West African 
coast, all the way from the Sahara Desert down to Angola. It was in freezing 
temperatures and at times the humidity must have been terrific as most of the 
parts are encrusted with rust. They brought back what I believe is the 
finest collection of records I have ever heard. They have from three to four 
hundred records, and every one I heard was perfect. They have records of 
music that has never been heard before. I have the instrument and I have 
made several perfect records with out a single adjustment, being made. I 
admit that this is not exactly the same instrument I built for you, but yours 
you will remember is the first of what we call the protable, mordern battery 
powered outfit.

I saw Mr. Engel the other day and he told me he had given up his active 
contact with the L.C., and that a Mr. Oliver Strunk has succeeded him. You 
know doubt have heardof this before this time.

Mr. John A. Lomax,

Dear Mr. Lomax:

     American Ballads and Folk Songs has been so favorably 
reviewed and commented upon that I would like to look through 
the volume. I wonder how much, if any, of the book has been set 
aside for the songs of the hoboes? Have you that old bum masterpiece 
the Rock Candy Mountains in your collection? How about the
 Bums' Convention At Montreal?  Shortly before the War, Ford, the 
I.W.W. songster for that hobo-workers ' organization, The Industrial 
Workers Of The World, wrote You'll Get Pie In The Sky When You
 Die; this song is sung in the underworld from coast to coast. Have 
you any of his stuff in your collection? There are several of 
his songs printed in a book entitled American Tramp and Underworld 
Slang, by Godfrey Irwin, published by The Sears' Publishing Co. 
A fruitful source for some of the authentic songs of prisons 
are the various prison publications: the Bulletin of San Quentin, 
Good Words of Atlanta, The News of this penitentiary and The 
Mirror of Stillwater, Minnesota. 
 
   If you would care for the melodies for a number 
of these songs, I believe I could supply you with them. I am 
enough of a musician for that. The lyrics for The Rock Candy 
Mountains and the Bums' Convention could probably be found in
 their entirety if you would request them from the editor of 
the San Quentin Bulletin; I know part of the songs, but if you
 wanted the full lyrics you had better write to the Bulletin.

    Should you have a copy of American Ballads and
 Folk Songs you can spare I would be very glad to receive it-- 
its condition does not matter. When I have finished with it
 I will see that it is passed on to others who are as much interested 
in the subject as I am.
[*ask for this song
collection all those [?]
much appreciated*]
                                   
     I forgot to mention in the first paragraph a
 famous old song called, You're a Mormom,  -------- -------- --------! Go 
back to Utah. ( I had to leave out part of the title because
 our mail supervisor is a lady). You probably will be able to 
obtain this song if you write to the Utah penitentiary's paper, 
Pen Wiper. I can give you the melody.
     With best wishes for the continued success of 
American Ballads and Folk Songs, I am

                                                                                                                                                                                   Respectfully,

Dear Sir:

     This letter has two or three objects.  First, I wonder if
you are on the lecture platform any of this year.  I heard so many students
speak favorably of your other lecture here that I believe it
could be arranged for you to return some time, if you are available.
I am not the chairman of the Public Programs Committee, but I am a 
member of it.  In view of the increased interest in folk lore in
this state I believe also that some other institutions might be 
interested, if approached on the subject.
      I do not know whether you received the enclosed sheets or 
not, but I believe not.  They will tell you about the new Society up
here.  We would be very glad to have you become a member of it, if
you feel that it is worth while.  We hope to publish something worth
while the very first year.  The outlook is very encouraging, and
the personnel of the Society is of a high class.
     I am still collecting folk lore.  While I have quite a 
few songs--more than twice as many as the list I sent you --- I have
been emphasizing folk tales of late.  In regard to the songs, I wonder
what you would charge me for an expert opinion as to the value
of some songs that I have.  I had thought of publishing some of the 
best ones as an early publication of the Folk Lore Society.  As I
am one of the editors, it would not be quite ethical for me to pass
judgment on the value of my own collection.  You could certainly do
this, and I am willing to pay you for it.  If this is agreeable, I 
can send you my list of song titles, with brief descriptions where
necessary.  You could select those that you want to examine and I
could send them to you.
     I lost my father last month.  He left me copies of some of
his old songs and wrote a diary of his experiences in Colorado, on
the cow trails, on ranches, etc.  Some time when I feel like it I
am going to look them over.  We still have a mountain girl with us,
but not the one who was with us before.  You might tell Alan that
she is married--the first one.

THE TENNESSEE FOLK LORE SOCIETY

     In response to invitations sent out by Dr. J. A. Rickard,
about fifty people met in Room 1, of the Administration Building
of Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, November 10, 1934, for
the purpose of effecting a permanent organization, Dr. Rickard
acting as chairman and Mrs. Helen Somerville Rafferty, as secretary.
The chairman began by explaining that John A. Lomax,
nationally known folk lorist, had aroused his interest in the matter
by pointing out the need of such an organization in Tennessee,
and declaring that the mountain sections of Tennessee were the
richest in folk lore of any portion of the United States.  He had 
urged Dr. Rickard to take the lead in forming such an organization.
     The meeting began with an introduction of each person present.
In addition, extracts were read from letters written to the chairman
from such persona as Dr. Charles S. Pendleton, Mrs. John Trotwood 
Moore, Miss Irene Bewley, and others,expressing a lively
interest in the formation of a folk lore society.  The chairman
then appointed the following nominating committee:  Prof. Hill
Shine, Maryville College; Prof. T. J. Farr, Tennessee Polytechnic
Institute; Miss Fannie Burr Kiser, Goodletsville Public Schools,
and instructed them to retire and consider nominees for various
positions in the society.  While the committee was at work, the
society proceeded to the consideration of a constitution for which
[had] purpose a tentative draft had already been prepared.  With
this as a basis, a constitution was put into final form  and adopted
(see constitution attached).  The nominating committee then
made its report and the society selected the following officials
to serve for the first year.  President, Dr. Charles S. Pendleton,
Head of the English Department, George Peabody College for
Teachers Nashville; first vice-president, Dr. Harry L. Upperman,
President of Baxter Seminary, Baxter;  second vice-president, Dean
Edwin R. Hunter, Maryville College, Maryville; third vice-president, 
Miss Fannie Burr Kiser, teacher in the public schools of
Goodletsville;  secretary and editor, Dr.. J. A. Rickard, Professor
of History, Tennessee Polytechnic Institute, Cookeville; treasurer,
Mrs. Maude Somerville Terry, Elementary Educational Supervisor
of Putnam County, Cookeville; councillors, Miss Irene Bewley, 
composer and reader, Greenville, Mrs. John Trotwood Moore,
State Librarian, Nashville; and Dr. Walter D. Cocking, State Commissioner
of Education, Nashville.  The secretary was directed to
secure a charter for the Society.  He announced also that it would
be the general policy of the editorial board to issue a series of 
mimeographed publications on folk lore, with perhaps some
printed bulletins when the finances of the society would allow 
this to be done.  The society by motion and second unanimously
agreed to hold the first annual meeting at Tennessee Polytechnic
Institute early in November, 1935.  The exact date to be set by 
the president.
     The society also voted to allow the secretary to draw on the 
treasury for incidental expenses such as stationery, stamps,
and printing.
     There being no further business, the meeting adjourned.

Society Begins Work

The Tennessee Folk Lore Society, which was organized November
10 for the purpose of collecting, studying, preserving, and publishing 
the folk lore of Tennessee, is perfecting its plans for gathering
available material throughout the state.

The following officers were elected: president, Dr. Charles S.
Pendleton, head of the English department, Peabody College, Nashville;
first vice-president, Dr. H. L. Upperman, president Baxter Seminary,
Baxter; second vice-president, Dean E. R. Hunter, Maryville
College, Maryville; third vice-president, Miss Fannie Burr Kiser,
teacher in the public schools of Goodletsville; secretary and editor
Dr. J. A. Rickard, head of the history department, Tennessee
Polytechnic Institute, Cookeville; treasurer, Mrs. Maude Somerville
Terry, elementary educational supervisor of Putnam County; councillors,
Miss Irene Bewley, collector and reader of folk lore, Mrs.
John Trotwood Moore, state librarian, and Dr. Walter D. Cocking,
state Commissioner of Education.

Folk lore, which includes folk songs, dances, tales, superstitions,
traditional narratives, legends, speech, poetry, and customs
provides us with those intimate, real, everyday activities of the
common man through the ages, and aside from its romantic aspects,
has an unique historical value. Tennessee is exceedingly rich in
folk lore, with its traditions of pioneers, Indians, Negroes, mountaineers,
countless war heroes, and river lore.

As time goes on, much, and eventually all, of this rich folk
lore will become lost unless it is preserved in permanent records.
Thus the task of the Tennessee Folk Lore Society is an important
one. The schools of the state are perhaps the best channels that
could be used in collecting folk lore, and for this reason it is
hoped that the high schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions
of higher learning will be greatly interested in the work
of the Society.

To enlist the co-operation of this group, a number of contests
for best folk lore contributions are to be sponsored among the high
schools and colleges of the state.

As for membership in the Society, any person, organization, or
institution interested in folk lore is eligible.

The schools of the state are perhaps the best channels that could be used in collecting folk lore, and for this reason it is hoped that the high schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions of higher learning will be greatly interested in the work of the Society. To enlist the co-operation of this group, a number of contests for best folk lore contributions are to be sponsored among the high schools and colleges of the state.

My dear Mr, Lomax,

      I was much interested in your letter with 
regard to songs popular among our prison women
but I fear, I can be of little assistance to you
in your quest as I have been unable to find any
copies in our files. Some years ago, before the
transfer of the Federal prisoners, who at that
time formed a large part of our population, a
number of such songs were current among them,
spirituals being especially popular among them,
spirituals being especially popular among the
negro women. Among the white women, a certain
song dealing with life in a New York jail (with
which many of them seemed to be familiar) was
a favorite. I cannot now recall any of the words
nor have I been able to find anyone here who remembers
them.
It is possible that some of our former prisoners
may still be at the Federal Industrial Institution
at Alderson, West Virginia, and that
through them you may be able to secure copies of
both the spirituals and the other songs referred
to. I am sorry that I can be of so little help
to you.

Sincerely yours,
Anna C. Anderson

17 December, 1934,

Dear Sir:

Your letter of November twenty-seventh reached me here after completion of a four year detail as Commanding Officer of the Naval Prison at Portsmouth, N. H.

I regret that I know of no songs at Portsmouth which could be classed as strictly prison songs. The routine there called for assembly in the auditorium three nights per week three quarters of an hour in advance of the showing of sound pictures. On Tuesdays and Fridays the men sang the popular songs of the day. On Sunday evening they sang the old- time religious songs, and this latter type were sung with very evident devotion. The men really enjoyed them as did the guests. But at no time were there ever any songs such as you seek. Our aim was to make men forget as far as possible that they were completely sit aside from the world. Rather our endeavor was to restore self-respect and self-confidence and to better equip the men to take an honorable place in society when released.

I have just received your circular letter requesting for the Library of Congress the words and tunes of songs and ballads current among prisoners, or originating with them.

We have a strong International Club here, composed of all foreign  born women. It is under the leadership of a woman trained in anthropology, Miss Helen Adams.

A good deal of interesting folk song and folk lore material has come to light. Would you be interested in this material in foreign languages, particularly Russian, Portuguese and Lithuanian? We have, too, a few doggerel ballads of the traditional sort.

I am asking one of our internes to get to work collecting this material if you can use it and if I can find a little money to finance this extra work.

Sincerely yours,

Miriam Van Waters

Carnegie Corporation,
522Fifth Avenue,
New York City.

Gentlemen:

As a beneficiary of the Corporation for the year 1934
I wish briefly to report on my activities for that period
in collecting and recording American folk-songs.

1) The result of the year's work is embodied in 200
fourteen inch aluminum discs on which are recorded
the tunes of approximately 600 songs, including variants,
and in numerous transcriptions of songs not worthy
of recordings. These recordings were made in nine states:
Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia,
Tennessee, and North and South Carolina. The car
in which we traveled records a mileage of more than
32,000.

3) The songs are of five main types: French-Negro, Acadian,
Mexican, Negro and Mountain White. We have made adequate 
preliminary surveys of folk-singing among the
French of Southwestern Louisiana and Negro convicts in
Southern penetentiaries, rich fields that had hitherto
remained unstudied. The Negro convict still finds use for
the work-songs that at one time were current in the ""free-world"".
We made an intensive study of a remarkable white 
family in Austin, Texas, the repository of twenty Child
ballads and at least 200 other folk-songs. A number of
game-songs, Frendh, Mexican, Negro and Mountain White were
recorded.

4) None of the collection made in 1934 is included in
""American Ballads and Folk-Songs"", John A. and Alan Lomax,
published in November.

5) I spent including replacements of two accidents, during
the year $1500 in excess of the grant kindly made to me.

6) The great territory covered necessitated hurried work.
From three to five years collecting might serve to bring
about an adequate collection of the folk-song material
current in this country.

[S]7) Several minor disasters considerably retarded the work.
The wheels of the car were stole along with the personal 
belongings o myself and my son.  While collecting ""Cajun"" 
songs in Southwestern Louisiana, the car overturned,was 
badly smashed, the recording machine was damaged, clothing 
destroyed by battery acid.  My son, Alan, my co-laborer, 
about this same time fell ill and was not able to rejoin me 
until December first, four months afterwards.  But the greatest 
source of delay for us was the frequently recurring 
breakdown of our recording instrument, furnished us by the 
Library of Congress.
During 1933 I had engaged to make folk-song lectures in 
nine states.  These lectures came in a group and required 
about three weeks of my time.  The tour resulted in the formation 
of a vigorous State Folk-Lore Society in Tennessee 
and in the cooperative help of several individual collectors.  
My vacation extended from July 21 until September 1.  
Alan took no vacation unless  his extended illness could be 
so-called.

8) I call your attention particularly to two matters that 
should receive your immediate attention:
1) Provision for the proper transcription,translation 
and annotation of the records we are placing in the 
Library of Congress.
b) Likewise the preparation of a list of commercially 
recorded fork-songs, securing and filing these records for 
the Library of Congress.

Respectfully submitted,

I beg to request a continuance of your financial support,

The recording machine has suffered from travel. It can be
greatly improved, so that it will give less trouble and pro-
duce better records. The Ford car, bought December 1933, has
traveled 34,000 miles and can be most economically exchanged.
So that we will not be dependent on the questionable hospit-
ality of prison officials and on the discomforts of Negro
swamp cabins and the like, we should have a house-trailer,
to serve as sleeping-quarters and recording laboratory. Such
equipment will save time and money and will enable us to work

John A. Lomax, Esq.

New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

     I was glad to have your letters of January 16 and 23. Besides
these, I have also seen your letter of January 27, addressed to the 
Librarian and enclosing copies of your correspondence with the Carnegie
Corporation.

     Before I reply to any of your other questions, let me relieve 
your mind of such anxiety as you may still feel about your various
shipments of records. The large shipment from Austin came in duly on
January 9. It consists of five packages containing, in all, 144 of
the large-size aluminum records, besides a few smaller disks, some 
aluminum, others flexible composition. In addition to this large shipment,
there is a single package from Louisiana containing 22 large-size
records. Finally, there is a small suitcase - I presume that you and
Alan brought this with you - containing 30 large-size records. Total - 
196 records, not counting those smaller than standard size. I have no
disturbed the order in which this material was received or the papers
that came with it. It seemed necessary, however, to make a count, if 
only to let you know what to expect.

     As regards representative Vinson's correspondent, one of Garwick's 
sound-recording instruments - similar, no doubt, to the one you are
working with - was used in Kentucky last June to record the festival of
the American Folk-Song Society.

     With the Librarian's approval, these records were made by Mr. Garwick
under the direction of Jean Thomas. The expanses of the recording
were covered by a Rockefeller grant with the understanding that the Library
should receive the records for deposit. I might add that the application
for this grant and the proposal that the records be deposited
here came from Miss Thomas, not from us. The Library agreed, however,
to accept the records for deposit. I enclose a list of the materials.

     Representative Vinson was informed, of course, that Mr. Garwick is
not connected with the Library as your assistant or in any other capacity.

February 20th, 1935.

Mr. John A. Lomax,
Wilton, Conn.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Since receipt of your letter of
February 12th I have been trying to find out something
about Walter Boyd, the negro who, according 
to your letter, was defended by Mahaffey & Keeney
charged with murder in the District Court of Bowie 
County in 1917.

The firm of Mahaffey & Keeney 
dissolved a number of years ago. Both are still
living in Texarkana but neither can remember anything
at all about this case.

The case of Boyd vs. State,
No. 5040, is reported in 203 S.W. 900. He tried
by Judge H. F. O'Neal who is now about 80 years old
and living at Atlanta, Cass County, Texas. J.D. Baker
was Sheriff at the time. His home is still here but 
he spends practically all his time in Dallas and I have
not been able to see him. It is extremely doubtful
whether Judge O'Neal will remember anything about the
case at this late date. Boyd's appeal was dismissed
with the following notation:

""DAVIDSON, P. J. Appellant was allotted a term of
20 years in the penitentiary under conviction
for murder. It is made satisfactory to appear
by the affidavit of the deputy sheriff and jailer
that appellant made his escape from jail by overpowering
the jailer, and was later captured. He
did not voluntarily return, but was arrested.
The motion of the assistant attorney general to
dismiss for this reason will be sustained.
The appeal therefore will be dismissed.""

February 22nd, 1935.

Mr, John A. Lomax,
Wilton, Conn.

Dear Mr. Lomax:
Since I wrote you on February 20th
I have secured from the District Clerk at Boston
the court papers in the case of State of Texas v.
Walter Boyd and find that he was indicted for murder
by the Grand Jury of the Bowie County on January 29th,
1918, the indictment charging that he killed Will
Stafford on December 18th, 1917, by shooting him
with a gun. I understand that Stafford was also
a negro. The papers indicate that Hugh Carney,
afterwards District Judge was the District Attorney
and prosecuted Boyd.

It appears that Mahaffrey & Keeney
did represent Boyd but neither of them can remember
anything about the case. They were doing a large
criminal practice at that time and this negro's
case has evidently escaped them.

The court's charge is the one usually
given in murder cases of this kind. I attach however
a part of it which may give you some information about
Boyd. Two witnesses testified that Boyd told them that
under the name of Huley Ledbetter he had been convicted
in Louisiana for shooting at a man and put on the chain
gang from which he escaped, raped a woman and then went
to Texas where he changed his name to Walter Boyd.

I also enclose copy of the affidavit
made by Henry Brooks, jailer and deputy sheriff, in
connection with Boyd's escape and on which his appeal
was dismissed.

Yours very truly,
A L Burford

Dear Mr. Strunk:
The machine came before I
left Wilton. We made about 30 new recorda[?]
from Lead Belly and as I left Alan
was working with an old Kentucky mountaineer
lady that seemed a real find.
The machine did not come ""prepared""
The charges I paid out were $7 30 as I 
recall. Also will it be possible
for the Library to refund me for
the expense of 30 records at 35[cent symbol] each

Dear Mr. Lomax:
Our Mail Division advises me that the recording machine and batteries
were sent to you prepaid and that the express people ought not to
have asked you to pay any charges on delivery. A duplicate bill of lading
is being sent to the express company's Washington office, on receipt
of which the Wilton agent will be directed to reimburse you.
I am looking into the question of the thirty records for which you
ask a refund and shall let you know about this in a day or two.
What can you tell me about Bascom Lazar Lunsford, who called on me
last week to tell me about the ballads he has just recorded at Columbia
University? Mr. Garwick, who has just written to me in this connection,
calls these Lunsford records ""the most important and most complete collection
made up to this time."" There are, as I understand it, nearly one
hundred double-faced records. There would seem to be nothing to prevent
our copying them for the Library if we can find some way of meeting the
expense. I believe, too, that Mr. Lunsford might be willing to record
some addition ballads for us if he were approached in the right way.
His address is Leicester, North Carolina.
I enclose a copy of a letter to Mrs. Flanders.
Faithfully yours,
Chief, Division of Music

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Many thanks for your postal, advising me that a copy of your American
Ballads is being sent to me.  I can not promist you to go through
this immediately - as you know, my time is somewhat taken up, at the moment,
with preparations for the chamber-music festival next month.  But
I do want to read it through carefully at the very first opportunity and
as, I think, just as keenly interested as you are in seeing a really faultless
edition brought out.  With the help of the records you have turned 
over to us, this should not be too arduous a task.

Glad to note that you and Alan plan to be with us next month!  We
should have many things to talk over.

Last week I write to you about the blank records for which you are
asking the Library to repay you, explaining that I would look into the
question for you and let you know about it.  I regret to say that I find,
on inquiry, that there is no appropriation from which this charge could
properly be paid.  This applies also to the charge of $26.30 for which
you sent on a bill the other day.  In the meantime we have last received
word from the Carnegie Corporation that favorable section has been taken
on your second application, the amount of this year's grant being $4,500,
as against $3,000 for last year.  This being the case, I do not doubt 
that you will be able to adjust these miscellaneous charges with the
Carnegie people, as in the past.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

Dear Mr. Strunk:

We have had the recording machine
 gone over carefully by two
experts, and have played it and recorded along side
theirs. To make it equal to the best
we have found, will require $250. Are
you, and Mr. Putnam willing for
an expenditure of that amount from 
the Carnegie grant? The work should
be done at once, so that we may
do some recording on our
way south.

Sincerely yours,
John A. Lomax

Dear Dr. Lomax:
 I have this morning your note of the 31st.
t seems to me a little more in accordance with our practice
that the remittances shall be in three installments of
$1500.00 each.  I am therefore authorizing the first one of
$1500.00 which, in accordance with your request, will be forwarded 
to you at Wilton, Connecticut.
I am glad to know that you will be resuming immediately
your work in the field.  With reference to the prospect, I must
admit to a slight concern.  It is the relatively small accumulation 
to date of your two years' efforts.  In stressing to the 
Carnegie Corporation the importance of the work, I should have
felt somewhat embarrassed to have to confess that the results 
of it thus far in our possession are represented by only about
200 records.
I do not, of course, mean to imply that the importance
is to be tested by the number of records produced.  Still, two
hundred seems a small result from so long a period of activity. 
Faithfully yours,
Librarian
P.S  My preference is still to be addressed by
my correct name which is Herbert Putman
and not Frederick W.

Dear Thompson, 

This is to confirm the conversation betweenfather, you and
myself concerning the recording instrument you are to build
for us. After we had turned over to you our old recording
instrument, not including the microphone, you were to build
for us your recording instrument.
As we discussed it, this instrument was to have the following
features, among others:
         An amplifier of your own design which on test should 
have as flat a frequency characteristic curve as the amplifier
we have been lately using and should have sufficient power
surplus to take care of our recording problems as well as the
aforesaid amplifier.
         A belt driven cutting unit with oil-damped cutting head
which cuts about ninety grooves perinch or less, as you think
safe, knowing the recording problems we face, --* a cutting head
which has been so weighted to cut a groove about as deep as
the [?] cut  that Garwich makes.
         A tripod type collapseable mike stand.
         Our old speaker with a new cone installed in your set.
         Extra length of cable with plugs for microphone exten-
sion. 
         Complete wiring diagram and advice about batteries and
how best to charge the,
         Transcribing instrument. 

I have some recording to be done in South Hadley at Mount Holy0
oke. They have a Garwick machine, are very well satisfied, but
have had trouble with poorly machined discs. Please send or
take up, as soon as possible, to Mrs. Mills, Head of the Speech
Department, Mount Holyoke College, ten fifteen inch discs and
charge them to our account. 

I hope our delay in sending this letter to you has not kept you
from working on our instrument. We are anxious to have it as
soon as possible. Our address will be 400 East 34th St. , Auustin, 
Texas. 

Sincerely yours,

June 11, 1935

Mr. John A. Lomax,
University Station,
Austin, Texas.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Huddie Ledbetter has called to see me and ask
me to look after his legal matters in the future.

He informed me that he made a trip through
to East with you beginning sometime in November and
extending into March of this year, and that while on this
trip he played and sang at various cities. From my
conversation with him I could not learn the exact arrangements
that he had with you with the reference to the division
of any moneys earned by him on this trip. I am therefore
writing you to ascertain just what arrangements you had
with him and what amount, if any money, is now due him as
a result of this trip.

Furthermore, I understand while in the East
Ledbetter made some Records for the American Record 
Corporation and that he is to receive certain royalties
for these Records. I will appreciate if you will let me
know what kind of contract was made with the American Record 
Corporation, and what portion of the royalty Ledbetter is
to receive.

Also I understand that the MacMillan Company
Publishers are publishing a song book containing Ledbetter's 
Songs exclusively and I will appreciate if you will let
me know what royalty Ledbetter is to receive from the sale
of these books.

Also please advise me what sums, if any, are due
Ledbetter in the moving picture ""March of Time"".

Ledbetter has indicated to me that you have been
very friendly to him, and sided him and that this letter is
not intended to in any manner indicate that he has in any 
manner lost confidence in you, but he is anxious for me to
become familiar with his affairs so that he can in the
future be fully advised of all contracts in which he is
interested, and it is my purpose to advise him in these

He informed me that he made a trip through to East with you beginning sometime in November and extending into March of this year, and that while on this trip he played and sang at various cities.

I am therefore writing you to ascertain just what arrangements you had with him and what amount, if any money, is now due him as a result of this trip. Furthermore, I understand while in the East Ledbetter made some Records for the American Record Corporation and that he is to receive certain royalties for these Records. I will appreciate if you will let me know what kind of contract was made with the American Record Corporation, and what portion of the royalty Ledbetter is to receive. Also I understand that the MacMillan Company Publishers are publishing a song book containing Ledbetter's Songs exclusively and I will appreciate if you will let me know what royalty Ledbetter is to receive from the sale of these books. Also please advise me what sums, if any, are due Ledbetter in the moving picture ""March of Time"". Ledbetter has indicated to me that you have been very friendly to him, and sided him and that this letter is not intended to in any manner indicate that he has in any manner lost confidence in you, but he is anxious for me to become familiar with his affairs so that he can in the future be fully advised of all contracts in which he is interested, and it is my purpose to advise him in these matters.

I have taken the liberty to trade in the old machine, badly

University of Texas laboratories, for a new one manufactured by
Lincoln Thompson, Waterbury, Conn. We had his machine in our
house at Wilton, and gave it a thorough trial, finally adopting

Dear. Mr. Lomax:

Replying at length to your long letter of June 16, I should
say, first, that I have had marked copies of last year's report
sent to all the folk-song people on your list; second, that I 
have passed on your news about the machine to the Librarian, who
is writing to you approving the exchange; third, that Professor
Herzog has returned the five Leadbelly records he borrowed, together
with twenty-six others, new to use, which we are adding to 
the collection, bringing the total number of Archive records to
657 (280 Lomax, 355 Victor, 22 Thomas).

May I ask you to send me before long your copy for the 1935
report? In the meantime I send you a supply of Archive letter 
paper. ""Early Songs of Uncle Sam"" should be in any day now and
will go forward to you as soon as received.

News bulletin: Father is in Hollywood for the summer, where 
he is ""Consultant"" for Metro-Goldwyn's Romeo and Juliet. Mother
will be here with us until about August 1. Mrs. Strunk and I sail
for Europe August 13. Do we see you and Alan before that? 

Faithfully,

crust of Hollywood smugness among 
the men he calls the salt of the earth.
Old-Timers Show Grit.
One of the things Rogers meant was 
demonstrated when j. A. Low of 
Doole, 61, one of the old-timers, after 
having roped his calf, broke  his own 
leg while throwing the critter to the 
ground.  Low didn't quit but hog-tied 
his calf while sitting down before he 
would allow himself to be carried  
from the arena.
With big delegations due Thursday 
from Dallas and other Texas cities, 
Stamford's steets on the Fourth of 
July are going to be hard to navigate, 
as the crowds on the second day already 
have made a beehive of t his 
beautiful, bright city of the Plains.
Official high point of the day's program 
was the election of new officers 
of the Texas Cowboys' Reunion Association, 
made up of grizzled veterans 
of the cow country.  Clyde Burnett of 
Benjamin was made president; Walk 
Cousins of Dallas and Lewis Ackers of 
Abilene, vice-presidents; Claude Jeffers, 
Matador, range boss; Judge C. E. 
Coombes of Stamford, secretary-treasurer; 
J. V. Hudson, Haskell, horse

Rogers yells Approval.
The first anyone knew that Will 
Rogers had come to town was when 
he yelled approval at a cowpony and 
hand during the morning contest of 
cutting out calves from a herd.
""This is the real thing,"" Will declared, 
glancing about at the dusty, 
big-hatted, happy crowd under the 
broiling sun.
Tex Moore, gray haired but with 
twinkling blue eyes, has an exhibit of 
his paintings in the Stamford Inn.  
He is a natural painter, never had a 
lesson in his life, but his realistic 
canvases of the great outdoors are 
being gathered up by shred collectors.
Tex is frankly contemptuous of modernistic 
art of all kinds.  His genius 
for color and composition hold the 
eyes long on his works.  Man may try 
to copy but he can never improve on 
God's beauty and grandeur, he declares.
Started Paining for Fun.
He began fooling with paint and 
brush to amuse himself during one 
winter while snowed up on his ranch 
in Colorado.  He was surprised when 
an Easterner offered to pay $150 for a 
painting.  This same canvas sold for 
$3,000, he was told.
Among the shuffling, laughing 
crowds of veteran cowmen and their 

women folks who packed the bunkhouse, 
official headquarters of the association, 
Wednesday night during the 
square dances, John Lomax was to be 
found, pencil in hand.  What he was 
trying to get was an old square dance 
called the ""Prophet's Special,"" being 
called by Judge Charles Coombes, 
general attorney for the Swenson cattle 
interests, the former president of 
the West Texas Chamber of Commerce.  
The Judge's head is nearly as 
full of old rag songs as are Lomax's 
notebooks.
As the fiddles squealed, the guitars 
strummed, and the spry old couples 
whirled and smiled, the Judge's call 
went out.
""First old boy across the ring, circle 
to the left with a pigeon wing, swing 
your opposite with a right-hand swing.  
Swing your corner with a left-hand 
swing.  Swing your partner with a 
right-hand swing.  Swing your opposite 
with a two-hand swing.  Treat 
your corner just the same.  Swing 
your partner and everybody swing.  
Round up equal till you all get 
straight.  Swing your corner like 
swinging on a gate.  Swing your partner 
and pull your freight.""
And swing their partners they did

while cheers broke from the throats 
of Governor, other honor guests, 
tanned sons and daughters of the 
open range and city folks come to 
enjoy the fun.
Boy Riders Score.
But old-timers and honor guests are 
not the whole show at the Stamford 
reunion.  An exhibition of daring 
and riding ability was given by 
three boys, Bob Estes, 14, of Baird; 
Bill Gist, 15, of Abilene, and Claude 
McAden, 14, of Abilene.  They forked 
wild Brama steers in competition with 
the tophands so well that McAden 
took first prize at the first night's performance 
and Estes fourth place.
These boys who have been riding 
steers and working cattle since they 
were 8, make down their bed rolls together 
under the stars near the S.M.S. 
churckwagon every night. 
Although the rodeo contestants are 
not quite as slick in the arena as the 
professional rodeo performers to be 
seen at the Fat Stock Show in Fort 
Worth, the contests here are more significant 
because the spectator realizes 
these boys also mend fences, ride herd, 
brand calves and make the cow industry 
click instead of spending all 
their time practicing tricks with a rope 
or twisting a cow critters neck.
If the management of the reunion 
will keep the program in the arena as 
true to the real range as it now is and 
not try to imitate the stunts of effete 
arenas or the big cities, they will be 
doing much to perpetuate the growing 
fame and success of their annual cowboy 
gathering.
Winners of prizes for best entries in 
main reunion parade held during the 
day were:  S. M. S. Ranch, Spur, chuck 
wagon with four matched buckskin 
mules, most typical ranch exhibition; 
individual entry, J. E. Jackson Jr., 
horse and buggy; juvenile entry, Billy 
Bob Looney of Fort Worth.

Allentown,Pa.
July 11,1935.

Dear Mr.Lomax:

I regret that you could not have come earlier in the
season as I had rather expected you would from your initial letter.
However,for the rest of the summer and most of the Fall I shall
be on the road myself with a recording machine taking down
Pennsylvania folk songs and tunes sung by my friends with
Professor Le Mon of Bucknell University as my associate. For this
reason,and much to my regret,I will not be available to render
that assistance to you that I had hoped that I would be able to.

I shall answer your letter in accordance with the
[*questions*] you asked in your last letter:

1.The name of the Columbia University professor who
made records of the Pennsylvania Folk Festival at Allentown is
George W.Hibbitt.

2. He and Mr.Garwick,representing the company that
manufactures the machine,made a complete set of records of our
festival--some thirty-five.Those that I have heard vary in
clearness,but all are very good.

3.No records were made of the National Folk Festival
at Chattanooga to my knowledge.

4.Unfortunately I witnessed only the performances
of the last two days and found them very interesting.I might say
that Miss Knott is doing a fine job against great odds.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is simply to let you know that I received a visit yesterday
from Mr. E. P. Jennings, of North Bennington, Vermont, who has just
been doing some field work among the Negroes in Central Western Alabama and
and in the neighborhood of Meridian, Mississippi. Mr. Jennings plans to
return to the South about September 1 to do a motion picture of Negro
life and expects to record some spirituals for eventual transfer to the
sound track of this picture. Since he proposed to turn these records
over to the Archive later on, I have put his in touch with Garwick and
Thompson and have suggested that he send you some account of his plans
and, if possible, look forward to seeing you here on his way South. I
should add that Mr. Jennings is anxious to take someone with him on this
trip to assist. If Alan does not care to go, perhaps you will suggest
someone else.
The Dallas News has just sent me, at your request, an account of
the Cowboy Reunion earlier this month.
Faithfully yours,
Chief Division of Music

Dear Professor Lomax:

I hope this is readable; have no typewriter available.
I had to have the manuscript containing my remarks on the
songs sent to you from New Haven and am following it with this.
It seems to be pretty late now to apologize for letting
you have mt contribution so late; I hope it was not too
much of an inconvenience, and perhaps in some way you will let
me make up for it. Naturally, I will be eager to know whether
you will find it to the purpose. I am hoping you will defend
your interests as author and tell me if the tone of the contributions
does not fit the book, or if I should in some way improve
it. The style is not quite even, and, if you wish, I'll
be glad to smooth it over a little more, with the help of my
wife, whose English has helped with it as it is now If there's
any change you'd wish to have made, send it back to me and I
shall forward it to Macmillan's speedily.
[* I think it
 will do, though I
'm sorry now 
that I didn't 
send it onto you. *]
I have marked with question marks on the margins
places where I wasn't sure of things. These places are: 1)
[* OK *] Statement according to which some songs were recorded from
other singers in the same prisons where Lead Belly sang for you
himself. This, of course, is to be stricken out if wrong.. The
[* OK *] remark about the guitar-accompaniment has an alternative form,
depending on the ultimate fate of the accompaniment. Another
[* OK *] place: 1924 as the date of the copyright of Clarence William's
You Don't Know My Mind Blues . You may know the date of the original
publication: would you be good enough to insert it if so?
To game songs I am possibly referring by another title than the
one you are using in the book:  these may have to be corrected.
Thus I called ""Willy de Weaver"" what you call, I think, ""Bad
Man Ballad""; ""Honey"" I have used for I'm all Out and Down"", and
perhaps another case in addition.

catch these
 I'll write

 is a little rough. Even so I believe transcriptions of 
some simple pieces (any of the reels or working songs for instance)
 would be an addition to the book. But transcriptions
 of the blues for instance would not turn out very well, I fear, 
nor accompaniments of the ballad-like things, on the whole.
 I  think if it is explained that there are approximations, accompaniments 
of simpler songs made by Mr. Wells would be quite 
nice in the book.

of this same package, I had to pay express charges of $8.84/

Mr. John A. Lomax
400 East 34th Street
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am very sorry that my delay in answering your letter should have
caused you any anxiety. As you know, any order for crating and shipping
must go through several departments thereby causing a delay. The machine
has been crated and is being shipped to you today, express prepaid. It
should be in Texas in a few days.

We sent Dr. Miller the requested information in August. He should 
have received it long ago. In case the list went astray, will you please
notify us so that we may send him a copy.

Regarding the song ""The Man on the Flying Trapeze"" the earliest edition
seems to be the first one listed below*. There seems to be some 
confusion as to the composer, as can be seen by comparing the cover title
and caption title of the second one on the list. Furthermore, Edward B.
Marks, in his book, ""They All Sang"" (New York, 1934, p. 232), refers to 
the song as an English one by ""Lee"" but gives no date. The year 1868, 
however, seems to be the year in which the song was first published.

Kindest regards to Mrs. Lomax, Allen and yourself,

Sincerely,

*Leybourne, George

Mr. Robert M. Lester
Secretary Carnegie Corporation
522 Fifth Avenue
New York City

Dear Mr. Lester:
Mr. Oliver Strunk, Chief of the Music Division of the Library of 
Congress, has asked me to report to you on the progress I am making on
the work covered by your grant of $ 4,500, dated March 7, 1935. When Mr. 
Strunk's letter came I was on a collecting trip, and I am, therefore, 
only now able to reply. 
This report covers scarcely more that seven months since receiving 
notice of my appointment. During that time my son and I have travelled 
a total of 15, 000 miles in collecting trips. We have forwarded to the 
other records, a total for the time of 261 records. With 300 records
deposited by us in 1934 the total number credited to your patronage 
reaches 561. 
On each of these records songs have been recorded on both sides, one
recording containing from 2 to 8 tunes. A fair average would be five separate
songs for each record, or a total of 2305. Necessarily there are in this number
considerable duplications - where a tune has been variously rendered in different
 localities or where more competent singers have been found after the first
recording. Also among the recordings are interesting examples of the chanting
of Negro ministers, various ""hollers"" and cattle calls. 
The bulk of the records made this year have come from Georgia, Florida,
and West Texas. A trip to the Bahamas, where a number of records were made,
disclosed the fact that apparently certain American folk tunes originated on
those islands. 
I have drawn $3000 of the amount allotted to this work and have made the following expenditures:
New Machine and supplies                              $450
Repairs                                                                     60
15,000 miles automobile travel at 5 cents       750
Lodging and meals 230 days at $5                   1150
Honorariums to singers                                       111.50
Other incidentals                                                     87.30
                                                                                                      2708.80

[*Letter of Mrs. Ruby Piers Tartt*]

Livingston, Ala.

Dear Miss Miles:
A long distance call affects me like meeting a friend passing
through on a train. My mind's a blank until it's too late. I was so
sorry not to have been more help when you called, but to save me I 
couldn't recall the songs I've heard and enjoyed so many times.
There is a very old feeble-minded Negro who sings a couple of
songs that I cannot catch. They sound like they came out of the heart
of Africa. Then he sings one that goes like this, and he is the only
one I've ever heard sing it:
""Lord, I'm a-climbin' Mount Zionie, Zionie wid dat glory in
my soul.""
Another one of his is: ""Rocky my soul in de bosom of Abraham."" -
and ""Oh my brother do you love Jesus"".
Then still another old Negro sings the ""John Henry"" songs,
""Boll Weevil"" etc - is clever as can be, plays a harp and does a barn
yard and train imitation. He really is an artist.
Doc Reed sings ""Slow down Chariot and let me Ride"" beautifully.
Another lovely one of his is ""John saw a nuther (?) man in de middle of
de air"". Then a more familiar one ""Thank God Almighty I'se free at
last"" and that's when I weep! ""Come Down Death"" and ""Travelin' Shoes""
are two of his others, also ""Trouble Oh Lord is so Hard. Nobody knows
my trouble but God"". Also: ""Don't you Want to go to that Beautiful
City?"", and ""Soon One Morning"", and another old one is ""I'm goin' home
to die no more"", of course these are the titles they have given me, or

Ark? Noah, Noah,"" etc, lots of verses and very interesting the way they
sing it. One verse facinates me, only I cannot write it:

I met a mister hypocrite de other day
He's always up and never down,
He's always right and never wrong,
Says jes' so the sinners lives, jes so he die,
Jes' so the tree fall, jes' so it lie.

My Lord, who built this ark"", etc
But the rhythm's the thing and they call Noah, Nora, they need the r.
All these Negroes do not live in the same neighborhood, most of them
have met each other through me. Whenever I find one worth a song and a
voice I corral some of the others and get them to sing it together. So
they don't all sing the same songs well. Tho; they can catch on enough
to follow, but ""Who Built the Ark"" belongs to Mary Jane Travis.

Here's another verse of Mary Jane's ""Who Built the Ark?""

I love this one, the ""er"" is necessary:

Says er po' sinner man or you runs away
Er but you got to come back er at de
Judgerment Day
Er you gotter go 'fre dem bars of God
The balance is dare er you must be weighed
Er says offer you balance dem balances too low
Says er down in er hell you show will shorely go
My Lord, Who Built dis ark, Nora, Nora, Lord!""

(Then something about - digging a grave with silver spade
And a link of chain for to link er me down
Er in de winding sheet for ter mind wind me up
Er friends all standing round
Dirt come tumblin' down and de coffin sound
Er in de creepin' things was on de ground.
My Lord, who built this ark, Nora, Nora!

I just adore that one and I'm crazy for you to hear it. So
many verses I can't recall half. Then there's another song they sing:
""Didn't You Hear my Lord Call"" - something about no evil in my soul, etc.

Sincerely,

Ruby Pickens Tartt.

Dear Professor Lomax:

                  I hope you'll pardon my tardiness in acknowledging
receipt of your letter of April 4. Illness has prevented
my answering sooner.

                  I am enclosing, as you request, a list of the
Indiana folksongs collected thus far, with some attempt at
classification. If further information is needed, please
let me know.

                  What you say of the superiority of records over
transcriptions is true, of course, and I should be glad to
have your help in recording the tunes already collected.
Plans for the publishing of the collection are very vague
as yet. I am now trying to get an assistantship in English
at I. U. for next year, and am to have an interview with
Professor Carter, Head of the Department, June 3, on which
date I have been asked by Professor Thompson to talk to his
class in ballads. Should I be successful in getting this
assistantship, I am planning to complete my doctorate at
Indiana, using as the basis for my dissertation part, at
least, of this folksong material. In any event I intend to
see that the collection is published somehow, and I should
expect duplicates of all records made for the Library of
Congress, and, too, I should expect (and feel that I have
the right to expect) that I would be given prior claim on
the use of all material furnished.

                  With apologies for having kept you waiting so long
for a reply, I am

Dr, Waldo G. Leland
[*→*]American Council of Learned Societies
907 Fifteenth Street
Washington, D. C.

My dear Dr. Leland:

Responding to your telephone call of yesterday, advising me that the
Carnegie Corporation has sought the opinion of the Council on the application
of Dr. John A. Lomax for a continuation of the grant covering the expenses of
his quest for material to be added to the Archive of American Folk-Song in
the Library of Congress, I take pleasure in sending you the following comments

We are glad to clarify that the results of this quest, in terms of recordings
actually deposited, seem to us an important contribution to the
Archive from a field, in itself important, which Dr. Lomac, both from previous
experience and present contacts, is specially competent to explore.
To date, after two successive grants in 1934 and 1935, Dr, Lomax has sent in,
from the Southeastern states and the Bahamas, 641 recordings. Just how much
remains to be done in this territory we cannot undertake to estimate. It is
rather for Dr. Lomax to outline the prospects, as he sees them, of securing
further significant material in this region.

Disposed to this extent to support the application of Dr. Lomax, we
think it not inappropriate to enumerate the conditions which we believe essential
to the development of a comprehensive and representative folk-song
archive in the Library of Congress. If the project is to function effectively
and to become, as it should, the national center for the concentration, preservation,
and study of folk and primitive music, its collections ought not to be
drawn from any one area or due to the activity, especially the subsidised activity
of any one individual, no matter how competent. On the contrary they
ought, in a large part, to consist of existing materials drawn in by active
effort from the center, which ought, then, to be in a position to encourage
and direct the efforts of local groups by placing at their disposal apparatus
and information, developing and disseminating its own collections, in the meantime,
though re-recording and exchange. Not until it is in a position to do
these things will the Archive be able to live up to the endorsement given it
last year by the Modern Language Association and, more recently, by the American
Society for Comparative Musicology.

If the above is sound, it follows that to concentrate the collecting actively
in one area, through repeated grants to a single individual, though it may
for a time be advantageous, will result eventually in a one-sided contribution
to the Archive.

Faithfully yours,

Chief, Division of Music

Prothero, died on April 9.

in getting this man paroled. When finally Judge Miller, who wished

I have read the manuscript entitled ""Los Pastores"" and, overlooking the terrible mispellings and mistakes and also overlooking the transcription of almost all of it into prose when it is evident that it was originally written in verse, I might state that the play has all the characteristics of the old Spanish Religious dramas and there are parts which very likely were written at the end of the Seventeenth Century by some of the disciples of the great Calderon.  The play has all the characteristics of an Auto Sacramental, a dramatic composition very popular in Spain until the beginning of the Eighteenth Century.

""Los Pastores or the Nativity Play which has become a prt
of San Antonio from its earliest days is a combination of a
Shepherd's play and a Morality play with the introduction of
several characters to represent Evil.

[""] There are no early Spanish or Mexican plays with the
plot of the San Antonio Los Pastores. Compared with any of
the Mexican Nativity Plays the San Antonio is superior
in design and execution. Evidently the San Antonio play was
an early adaptation by someone, probably the missionary, well
versed in the Spanish dramas popular at the time.

The play Los Pastores was first given in the Missions.
When the Missions were secularized, the people took the play
to their homes. Thus began the custom of organizing troupes
of players in different localities by men who could neither
read nor write, and who learned their parts as their leader
repeated them, line by line.
The rehearsals were as important and enjoyed as much as
the final performance.
The play was usually given out of doors to an audience
diverse in interests and appearance but one in passions and
beliefs.

The San Antonio version of Los Pastores as a whole is
now lost. The play has become a compilation of parts of
several versions of the play. The hideous masks, an Azted
note, the ludicrous costumes, the character of the Indian, are
alien to the simple, joyous, Shepherd's Play of early days.

to delight and to interest the spectators: the Angel, Lucifer,
Gils, the only woman in the play, her lazy spouse Bartolo, and
of course, the Hermit who keeps them all in good humour.

In spite of all its blemishes, the spirit in which this
voluntary Christmas celebration is given makes it worthy of
preservation. Today, as yesterday, actors and audience are one
in their profession of faith, expressed by a survival of a
Medieval drama.

""Las Posadas commemorating the journey of Joseph and
Mary to Bethlehem is a Christmas celebration of Old MExico
frequently seen in San Antonio.
The Posadas begin nine days before Christmas. Hostesses
are chosen for each evening. With lighted tapers the guests
go from room to room, knocking at doors which will not open.
Finally they are admitted. They stand before the nacimento
sing Christmas carols, and recite short prayers. The rest of

Dear Mr. Lomax:

 We have been working for some time as you know on the question
of a reissue of COWBOY SONGS AND OTHER FRONTIER BALLADS with the
changes which you have in mind. Unfortunately the costs of the revision
have been much greater than I anticipated when we first talked
the matter over. Despite this fact, our plans have shaped up as
follows:

We would like to bring out a revised edition of the book in
1937, with the substitution of about twenty-five new songs for twenty-five 
which you think should be eliminated. We have allowed for
eliminating the present pages of music, with piano accompaniment, from
the book and substituting for it music for fifty or sixty of the songs
made up of one-line notations only. We have also allowed for a certain
number of notes which I understand you wish to add. This, I think, is
in accordance with the plans which we talked over when you were here,

I may also say that we are planning to increase the size of the book
considerably so that it will be a much more attractive volume.

In order to accomplish this and still price the book at even
as low a price as $3.50, it will be necessary for me to ask you to make
a certain concession in the matter of royalties. Will you be good
enough to agree to a royalty of 10% of the cash received for the first 1500 copies sold? The royalties will then revert to the regular 10% of 
the retail price. I hesitate to ask you to do this, but it is unfortunately 
necessary if we are to price the book at a reasonable figure
and I think that this is very important in view of the fact that the
book is now available at so low a price as $1.75. We ourselves are
making a considerable additional investment in the book and I can only
hope that you will be willing to share to a slight degree the risk involved.
I hope that this revision will make of the book a volume which
will continue to sell for many years to come.

Won't you be good enough to let me know your reaction to my
suggestion as well as to the type of revision which I have outlined?
Would you also tell me when it would be possible for you to have the
revised copy of the book? I might add that we are planning to reset
it  entirely.

Cordially yours,
James Putnam
Assistant to the President.

Mr. John Lomax
University of Texas Station
Austin, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Enclosed is a typed copy of your report, in which I have taken
the liberty of making a very few small changes. As you will see, I
have filled in the total number of records received from you this
year, leaving for the present the number of songs in each classification
blank. Mr. Waters had begun work on the title index to 
the collection a week or so ago. In the meantime, however, Mr. 
Seeger's assistant - Mrs. Robertson - has volunteered to assign one 
of her helpers to the job. I trust that this arrangement will work 
out - if it does not, Mr. Waters will continue.

A second copy of your report goes to Mr. Stevens, as requested.

Delighted, of course, with your reports from Blowing Rock,
Ashville and Arkansas. Thus far no word from Professor Morris.

On the 24th, we received a shipment of nine disks from Miss
Barnicle. These are the ""Aunt Molly Jackson"" records listed in the 
typed catalogue of the Barnicle Hurston recordings, but not previously
sent in.

Two packages and a letter from Macmillan have come for you here.
One package and the letter are marked ""Hold."" There is also a letter
from G. Schirmer. Shall we forward?

My greetings to Alan, please!

My dear Sir:

I have just learned from Dr. John A. Lomax that his
son Alan, who is a graduate of the University, may be among those
to be considered by your committee for a travelling fellowship
during the coming year.  His scholastic record at the University
will doubtless insure him adequate consideration; and I should not
venture any expression in his behalf were it not that the application
of the year which he proposes is one that I have reason to believe
will result in a contribution to our literature and record of
American folk-lore and folk-song.  I have had special opportunity
to observe the enthusiasm and competence of young Lomax, in relation
to these subjects, from his association with his father in the field
work which for several years past the two have jointly pursued, under
grants from one of the Foundations, with the purpose of developing
in the Library of Congress invaluable records for subsequent study.
The combination in young Lomax of that interest, supported by energy
and controlled by unusually mature intelligence, together with his
academic qualifications, seems to me calculated to promise from his
year in the field results of serious general importance.

I am looking forward with much hope to hear that your
committee has found it possible to place at his disposal the resource
of the fellowship.

Believe me,
Faithfully yours,
Librarian

Dear Dr. Putnam:

Referring to our conversation of this morning,
I recommend that you purchase for the Music Division
a ""Presto"" sound recording machine which I am
told sells for $250.  The machine is inclosed in a
single case and weighs only 100 pounds.  I understand
the price is for the entire equipment including
a microphone.  If, however, this microphone is
not of the most satisfactory type for transmitting
group singing, I recommend that a microphone best 
suited for this purpose be purchased.  The additional
cost should not be more that $25 or, possibly
$50.

I am free to stat on a long collecting trip
for the Library as soon as the machine is received.

The address of the company is Presto Recording
Corporation, 139 West 19th St., New York City.

Very respectfully,

Att: Mr. Lomax:

Dear Mr. Alsberg:

I had a conference with Professor L. L. Dantzler, head of the Department
of English of the University of Kentucky, on Wednesday of
this week, and during the discussion the question of folklore arose,
and I told him of your trip which you had proposed for Kentucky
and that you wished to take some recordings of dialect, singing,
etc., in the State.

He is very anxious to meet you when you make this trip, and to accompany
you in some of this work since his specialty is in grammar
and speech.  He expects to be in Washington during the holidays and
I gave him your name and address at Writers' Headquarters, and I 
feel that you will find him a very interesting man and one who will
be able to render some service to you.

Professor Dantzler is preparing the Introductory Essay for the
State Guide, on Literature in Kentucky.  If you care to write him
you may do so by addressing him at the University of Kentucky in
Lexington, Kentucky.

Your letter reminds me of the proposal which you
and Dr. Putnam brought to our attention some time ago. I regret
that it has not been possible to take up this matter with any
likelihood of giving encouragement and this accounts for my delay
in seeing you and Dr. Putnam. A good many minor projects in

My dear Mr. Lomax:

Thanks so much for your note from Mobile.

Your records have been received, and we
shall, of course, leave them untouched until
you arrive.

I have written recently to Professor Smith.
This is, however, the busiest time of the year
for me, and I have, as yet, had no opportunity
to complete the account of the work of the Archive,
which he has asked me to send him.

Your son John teleported today for information
about Alan. I may as well repeat here what we told
him over the phone--that our last report from Alan,
in which he speaks of his marriage, was received on
the first of this month, and that the Librarian has
approved his continuing in Haiti until an unspecified
date in April.

Faithfully yours,

Dear Mr. Lomax,
     When Lillie arrived yesterday with her 'Edison wind up', as she expressed it
I said 'The Lomaxes must be on the way'.  We want you to come when you can 'get sent'
but I have been really glad the fates didn't send you the past two months.  Everybody
has been sick except Lillie and me, and, as Lillie said, ""Miss Jinny, I tell'em at home, us
aint had time to be sick"".  My father is now in the hospital for a good rest.  Our nursing
got him up but he needed some pretty trained nurses and the quiet that my boys cheated
him of here.
     I saw Miss Montgomery in Conway for a little while after she had seen you in Columbia.
She was as disappointed as I that your plans hurried you along North.  It is funny
how anxious we get to have you pass on our collections.  Please if (or when) you do come,
bring, as you did before, the ones of the songs I've sent in that you have not already recorded,
and it will then be an easy matter to find the singers.  I am trying to keep a record
of some that may not get get to you for some time.  Lillie gave me one with twenty-nine stanzas
yesterday.  She didn't know I was getting it and occasionally hummed a whole stanza.
     I appreciated your criticisms.  It was an interesting fact that the only thing in my effort
(not effort but attempt) at description that you commented on favorably -- the use of [ter]
terse short little sentences (that I thought I had absorbed from my love of Victor Hugo [(] and
reckon I absorbed from association with some of the natives who talk like Dickens' Jingle!).
-This (shall I say style) was adversely criticized by Miss Montgomery's right hand assistant
(Mrs. DuBose) who wrote me she thought as a contrast to the negro dialect, I should
cultivate (affect) smoothly flowing sentences.  She, of course, was trying to help.  As
a matter of fact 'Style' has never entered into my calculations.  I just concentrate on
seeing what I want to describe and write it down.  There is much to learn.  By the way, she
sent me 'Green Mansions' to read.  I am three hundred years behind with the masters so
have not read any thing in many moons.
     Did Miss Montgomery write to you that Mr. Reid Smith had lost his wife?  Incurable cancer.
It was like you said.
     Write me your wishes and we will arrange the party.  Aunt Hagar comes weekly and
has kept us in cow peas for hoppin-John.  She has been kept pretty busy all winter with
Grans and Great-Grans who will keep coming.---this crop never fails and the harvest time
knows no seasons!
     With our very kindest wishes to you and Miss Tirror and real affection

Dear Mr. Strunk:

I wish you would write to Professor Alton C. Morris of the University
of Florida, Gainesville, and tell him

1. that immediately on my arrival in Washington, I
turned over to the Library all the records that I
had made through his cooperation while I was in
Florida (Mr. Waters can give you the number of these
records).

2. that it is your understanding that no one shall
be allowed to make use of these records for some
time, to be designated by you.

3. that you request him to notify you when it will
be possible to ship the machine on to Washington.
(I think this request will at least influence him
to speed up his job.  As a matter of fact, if the
machine were here, I would take it out next week to
do some recording in Ohio. I shall certainly need it
very soon.)

Dear Mr. Lomax:

We enjoyed your visit with us very much.  I have 
heard many speak of the splendid lecture which you so 
generously gave to us. I look back with the keenest 
pleasure on the day spent with you recording folk songs 
at Newberry.

Mr. Morris has been greatly distressed for fear 
that you may have misunderstood his caution with reference 
to his material.  I can assure you sincerely that he meant 
to imply no distrust of you. Since his career depends to 
so large an extent upon his own use of the material he 
has discovered and collected, he is, naturally enough, a 
little concerned about what might happen if you should 
sever connections with the Library, or if others in authority 
should inadvertently make his material accessible.  
He has a very high regard and admiration for you and your 
work, as we all have, and is keenly distressed at the possibility 
of losing your trust in and regard for him.

Following your suggestion, I have been urging Mr. 
Morris to go to Harvard next year.  He has received aid 
from the General Education Board.  If he does decide to 
go, would you write him letters of introduction to the 
men you know there?

With best wishes.

Dear Dr. Lomax:

The Merry-Go-Round column of the newspapers
carries the information that you are supervising a
WPA project to record folk songs of negroes.

I would like to suggest that you include in
your project, or frame another to include, the Mexican
corridos prevalent in the United States. As a starter
you might go to Eusebio Gonzalez of Falfurrias, Texas,
who goes to Corpus Christi when the cotton harvest is
ripe. He writes corridos, sells the printed sheets, and
sings on the street corners.

Sincerely yours,

Mr. John A. Lomax
National Advisor on Folklore

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

I am in receipt of your postcard and wish to
re-assure you as to our efforts to find the tune
of the Rube Burrow ballad. Our representative in
Uniontown, where the ballad was discovered, has
been told to make every effort to get the tune
sung for her and written.

I am sending under separate cover several
songs. Three were in a batch of songs submitted
by our new Negro worker. He sent a number of
others but I didn't think them worthy of forwarding
as they suggested, and I believe are, published
works.

Luther Clark says that ""Billy Boy"" is a variation
of a song his sister sings. Clark is at this
moment off in a corner somewhere trying to sing to
a musician on our project the air to his song ""Cindy"".
I am hoping that when they come in they will have
something in the way of a tune to submit as I hope
""Cindy"" is a novelty. After Clark's heroic effort
to produce a tune,(he claims to be tone deaf) I
sincerely hope it will be a new one for you.

The Negro Shelby has just started and these are
his first submitted manuscript. I am writing him
today and sending one of Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt's
typical Negro songs as an example of what we want.
I think he is inclined to let his own educated versions
of the songs replace the words of his Negro
friends. He told me during a recent interview that
he knows a number of slavery Negroes. His letter
this morning stated that some ex-slave interviews
will follow. I am hoping for something characteristic
from him and if not disappointed will take great pride
and pleasure in forwarding.

We have two illustrated slave stories in process
of editing. You will receive these very soon.

Yours very cordially

Dear Mr. Lomax,

Macmillan Co. has suggested that I write directly to
you in regard to the use of some American folk songs.

I am interested in developing some ensemble music
for instrumental combinations based on several folksongs
as quoted in your two books.  Ballads and Folksongs and 
Negro Folk Songs as sung by Lead Belly.

I do not intend to use the words but would like to
quote as much as eight measures from each of several tunes.
I can either quote directly or write around the tune and in
its general spirit.

My problem is to determine the extent of the restrictions
involved in the reprint of the tunes in this developed form.
To what extent are these tunes considered public domain under
copyright law.  The following tunes I offer as specific
examples out of which to develop pieces.

Gwine Dig a Hole  p 71  Lead Belly
Blind Lemon  p 164  ""  ""
Mustang Gray  p 395  Folk Songs and Ballads
Gettin up Holler  p 375  "" ""

Yours sincerely,

Miss Helen Waterhouse
104 Burton Avenue
Akron, Ohio

Dear Miss Waterhouse:

At last the troubles with my recording machine seem
to be at an end and I am able to say that I shall start for
Akron within a week or ten days to make records for the folk
song collection in the Library of Congress from Captain Nye. [ * X * ]
I shall bring along with me the list of the titles of the
songs that he knows, which you have been good enough to send
me.  In the meanwhile, won't you have him practice up on the
tunes of the old ones.  You understand, of course, that I
wish to record only those songs that have no standard published
tunes or such noted songs as Barbara Allen, the House
Carpenter and others that have been handed down by word of
mouth for so long that the tune varies with the individual.

I am also particularly interested in any of the
songs connected with or descriptive of the life on the Erie [ * X * ]
Canal.

It will be a great pleasure to meet you and Captain
Nye and I feel that these contributions to the Library of 
Congress will be most interesting.  He will be given full
credit for anything he does.

Won't you let me know if now is an altogether
suitable time for me to make the trip?  I shall travel by
automobile and bring my machine in the car.

Very sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax

(our Librarian in Denver) received word from
him that you will be working at the

written Mr. Robert Gordon for his written

collected and left at the Library.

you and Mrs. Lomax were as kind

on seeing the little article I wrote for
the National Altrusa magazine on folk-
songs.  I owe you an abject apology for
not answering your second letter.  My
mother became more ill and died shortly
afterward.

Last summer I spent in England, reading
Cecil Sharp's books in the library of the Cecil
Sharp House, and attending the summer
season of the English Folk Dance & Folk Song
Society in Stratford.

It looks now as if I will reach Washington
(driving) by July 5th.  Since I don't
know any place in Washington except the
Wardman-Park Hotel, that had best be my

Dear Mr. Lomax:

This is to express my cordial thanks for the two copies of  ""Provisional Check-List of Disks ... in the Archive of Folk-Song,"" sent to me recently, on your order, I am sure, by the Library of Congress.

The number of folksong recordings is impressive, and the variety and the nature of the titles are most interesting. I look forward to the time when I may have leisure, while in Washington, to visit the Folk-Song Archive and listen to some of the songs recorded.

I hope that folksong scholars and students may look forward, also, to an early realization of your plans for making duplicates of records available. It is, as you know, very difficult to get satisfactory records of folksongs from the commercial companies.

To this word of thanks permit me to add my good wishes for the success of your enterprises and my hope that your may visit these parts again. I remember with pleasure your former visits.

Yours very sincerely,
A. B. Hudson

P. S.- You may be interested to learn that the tunes to forty-odd of my Folksongs from Mississippi are in process of publication by the Federal Theatre Project, music to be edited by Herzog.

Dear Professor Hudson:

I appreciate your comments on the ""Provisional Check-List of Disks"". Although the time has been short, we have added nearly five hundred new disks since the check-list you examined was printed. I shall be interested to see the tunes of your forty-odd Folksongs from Mississippi, which are being edited by Dr. Herzog. You must be sure that the Library has copies. By the way, my son Alan is now in charge of the Folk-song Archive. The Journal of American Folklore asked me to review your ballads for that publication, and I am passing the job on to Alan. As a proud father, I know you will forgive me for saying that he writes far better than I. The sad part of this statement is that it is the truth.

I am heading down the road in a few days for the South and might possibly drive by the University of North Carolina. If so, you'll have to forgive me for stopping to see you.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Dr. Payne:

It always does me good to read a letter from you. Recently I went through a lot of old correspondence and got a distinct feeling of pleasure on finding and re-reading a lot of your early letters to me when we were busy organizing the Folklore Society of Texas. That reminds me, I am sorry to say, of my attending a meeting of the Society a couple of years ago in Austin where you were called on to talk and nobody paid any attention to me. I didn't have anything to say and probably would have said badly whatever I attempted, but I did want Dobie to say, ""John Lomax is here too."" There is no question about Dobie's friendly feeling for me, and I suppose that he simply, honestly forgot. It is a sad feeling to realize that you're entirely out of some enterprise that you really worked hard for. Thank you for permission to use the Country song in my Cowboy book and thank you also for a copy of your article published in the Texas Folklore Volume for 1927. I am handing it on to Alan for inclusion in the Music Division of the Library of Congress. Alan, by the way, is now a permanent employee of the Library, in charge of the Folk-Song Archive.

The music to the other three songs you mention, even if they are in some degree folk-songs, I think can be copy-righted as has been done by my son and myself. In your case, however, we're glad to release our claim in your favor for the purpose indicated in your letter of June 10. We hope you will make reference to the source of the music, or some acknowledgment that will call the attention of your reading public to the two books from which you borrow. At best, books on folk music do not have a large sale unless they be such tunes as Casey Jones and Home on the Range, which acquired such wide appeal.

Mr. John A. Lomax
1618 Avenue Y
Lubbock, Texas

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Alan has kept me informed about your trip which seems to have been a
very successful one.  The Archive of American Folk-Song has been booming
at this end too.  Its activities are increasing daily and both Alan and I
are kept very busy.

I have been trying to systematize some of our activities, and one of
our most difficult problems is that of ""restrictions"".  These restrictions
would be on the playing of the records.  They are not equivalent to a copyright
on a song.  I have been trying to work out a form by which collectors
would have to specify a definite time limit on the duration of the restrictions.
I should like to have your opinion on this matter.

I have entered into correspondence with Professors Morris and Smith,
and have received very interesting letters from both of them.  Professor Morris
wants to have his records withheld from the public until his dissertation
is published.  He says that he suggested a three year period, but wants the
privilege of extending this is case he doesn't finish in time.  I suggested
that he ask for a three year restriction with the option of a three year renewal.
If you approve, I shall accept these conditions.  Professor Morris
also asked me to write an article on the activities and plans of the Archive
which I promised to do as soon as certain of our plans are a little more
definite.

Professor Reed Smith wrote me explaining the viewpoint of the average
folk-song collector and what he expects from the Archive.  Some of these requests
can be met by the Library and some cannot.  I have just written him
explaining all this and hope to solve several problems by corresponding with
him.

I hope that you and Mrs. Lomax had a very pleasant trip and will
enjoy a good rest when you get home.  Please write me soon.

With kindest regards,
Sincerely,

Acting Chief, Division of Music
