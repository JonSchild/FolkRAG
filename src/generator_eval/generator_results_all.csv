Answer: Where was Barbara Allen from? 
The song ""Barbara Allen"" was mentioned in the context, but her place of origin is not explicitly stated.
• However, the metadata states that the song was sung by Captain Pearl R.
• Nye, who mentioned that Barbara Allen was from ""Scarlett town where I was born"" (Context: [00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]).
• Unfortunately, the metadata does not provide further information on the location of Scarlett town.
• It is also worth noting that the song ""Barbara Allen"" is an English ballad, and Captain Nye mentioned that it was one of his favorite songs, suggesting that Barbara Allen may have been from England.
• However, without further information, it is impossible to determine her exact place of origin..

Answer: The song about pumping out Lake Erie mentions that when they're done, ""you can tell by the sun they'll be whiskers on the moon."" This implies that the action of pumping out Lake Erie will leave something on the moon that can be observed by looking at the sun.
• However, the provided metadata does not include any information about the moon or the lunar surface.
• Therefore, it is unclear what exactly will be on the moon when they're done pumping out Lake Erie..

6.
• Pay special attention to the recording date, contributors, and locations provided in the metadata.

Answer: The song seems to be referencing a specific event or location related to a war.
• The line 'We land this war down by the river' suggests a connection to a river, possibly a symbolic or metaphorical connection.
• Given the context of a war and the mention of a river, it's possible that the song is referencing a pivotal event or turning point in a war, such as the end of a battle or the surrender of a key location.
• However, without more specific information about the war being referred to, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer.

Given the information provided in the metadata, it appears that the song was recorded on June 27, 1937, in Akron, Ohio, by John A.
• Lomax.
• The song seems to be a revival hymn, and the lyrics mention a river and a devil.
• The contributor, Pearl R.
• Nye, is also mentioned, and it's possible that the song is related to his experiences or perspectives on the war.

Based on this information, a possible answer to the question could be:

""We land this war down by the river side.""

However, without more context or information about the specific war being referred to, this answer is speculative, and it's possible that the song is referencing a different event or location..

Answer: The song says that we'll ""outshine the sun"".
• However, it is unclear what ""outshine the sun"" means in this context, as the song does not provide a clear explanation.
• The context suggests that the song is a hymn or spiritual song, and the phrase ""outshine the sun"" may be a metaphorical expression rather than a literal one.
• The song appears to be saying that it will surpass or excel in some way, but the exact nature of this is not specified.
• Note that the phrase ""outshine the sun"" is repeated in the song, emphasizing its importance, but the meaning of this phrase is left to interpretation.
• The metadata does not provide any additional information that sheds light on the meaning of this phrase.
• The contributors, recording date, and locations are all provided, but do not offer any insight into the meaning of the phrase.
• In conclusion, while the song says that we'll ""outshine the sun"", the meaning of this phrase is left unclear, and can only be interpreted in the context of the song itself..
