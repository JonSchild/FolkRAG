Answer: 
When they're done pumping out Lake Erie, what will be on the moon?
The song mentions that when they're done, you can tell by the sun that there will be whiskers on the moon. This implies that the song is referring to a future event that has not yet occurred, and it is making a humorous prediction about the state of the moon. However, there is no clear information provided in the Context or Metadata about what will actually be on the moon at the time in question, as the moon is not mentioned again in the provided text. The only relevant information is the mention of the moon by the song, which is likely meant to be humorous or whimsical. 

It is worth noting that the song is likely making a humorous or whimsical prediction, and the mention of the moon is not meant to be taken literally. The song is about pumping out Lake Erie and the importance of the canal, and the mention of the moon is a playful addition to the lyrics. 

In summary, the song is making a humorous prediction that when they're done pumping out Lake Erie, there will be whiskers on the moon, but there is no clear information provided about what this actually means or what will be on the moon at the time in question."
