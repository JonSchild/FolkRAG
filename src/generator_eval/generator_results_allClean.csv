llama,Complete this line from a song: 'We land this war down by the',river,"The song seems to be referencing a specific event or location related to a war. The line 'We land this war down by the river' suggests a connection to a river, possibly a symbolic or metaphorical connection. Given the context of a war and the mention of a river, it's possible that the song is referencing a pivotal event or turning point in a war, such as the end of a battle or the surrender of a key location. However, without more specific information about the war being referred to, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer.

Given the information provided in the metadata, it appears that the song was recorded on June 27, 1937, in Akron, Ohio, by John A. Lomax. The song seems to be a revival hymn, and the lyrics mention a river and a devil. The contributor, Pearl R. Nye, is also mentioned, and it's possible that the song is related to his experiences or perspectives on the war.

Based on this information, a possible answer to the question could be:

""We land this war down by the river side.""

However, without more context or information about the specific war being referred to, this answer is speculative, and it's possible that the song is referencing a different event or location.",0.3736749291419983
