  "project_name": "Mapping Deprived Areas in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) - Part 1",
  "Objective": " The goal of this project is to develop a methodology to map of deprived areas using a range of geospatial data\nat approximately 100m grid cells. This will help cities understand the spatial pattern of Sustainable Development \nGoal 1 (Poverty) and Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities and Communities). Want to use a\ncombination of open source geospatial data and satellite imagery to map variations in poverty. Allow for\ncomparisons between cities and determine if models made in one city can be used in another city. \nThis project could possibly be funded by the European Space Agency (for 8 cities) and theoretically\ncould be expanded to the entire developing world.\n",
