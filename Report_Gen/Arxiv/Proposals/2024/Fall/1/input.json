  "Rationale": "\n            This project is going to help agencies to tackle poverty and help countries.\n            ",
  "Approach": "\n            I plan on approaching this capstone through several steps.  \n\n            1. Automate data capturing from Google Earth Engine (Python code in the engine).\n            2. Work on the covariate features importance.  \n            3. Use covariate features to model degree of poverty (Classical Models).\n            4. Use a model developed in on city and apply it to other cities (Transfer Learning)\n            5. Combine satellite images with covariate features.  \n            ",
  "Timeline": "\n            This a rough time line for this project:  \n\n            - (3 Weeks) Data Automation.  \n            - (3 Weeks) Feature Importance  \n            - (4 Weeks) Modeling  \n            - (2 Weeks) Combine satellite images with covariate features  \n            - (1 Weeks) Compiling Results  \n            - (1 Weeks) Writing Up a paper and submission\n            - (1 Weeks) Final Presentation  \n            ",
  "Expected Number Students": "\n            For this project maximum 4 students can work on it.  \n            ",
  "Possible Issues": "\n            The challenge is on data analysis part , find a good features and train a decent model.\n            ",
