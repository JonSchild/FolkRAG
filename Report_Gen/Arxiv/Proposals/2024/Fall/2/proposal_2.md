## 1 Objective:  
 
            The goal of this project is to develop an advanced multi-agent system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to 
            solve complex tasks involving the analysis and synthesis of information from diverse document sources. The system will:

            1. Utilize a language graph architecture to represent and process information efficiently.
            2. Implement multiple specialized LLM agents, each trained for specific tasks such as:
               - Document classification and routing
               - Information extraction from various document types (e.g., academic papers, legal documents, financial reports)
               - Summary generation
               - Cross-document fact-checking and verification
               - Query understanding and response generation
            3. Develop a coordination mechanism for agent interaction and task delegation.
            4. Create a unified interface for submitting complex queries and tasks to the system.
            5. Implement a result synthesis module to combine outputs from multiple agents into coherent responses.
            6. Ensure scalability to handle large volumes of documents and complex multi-step tasks.
            7. Incorporate explainability features to provide insight into the system's decision-making process.

            The end product will be a powerful, flexible system capable of understanding, analyzing, and synthesizing
             information from diverse document sources to solve intricate, multi-faceted problems.
