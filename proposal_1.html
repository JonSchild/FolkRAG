<h2>1 Objective:</h2>
<pre><code>        The goal of this project is to develop an advanced natural language query interface for Library of Congress (LOC) 
        data, combining aspects of web scraping, data structuring, and multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) with 
        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

        The system will:

        1. Implement a comprehensive web scraping and data acquisition pipeline to collect diverse data types from the 
        Library of Congress, including XML documents, catalog records, audio/video content, PDFs, and datasets.
        2. Develop robust data extraction and transcription processes for audio, video, and PDF content.
        3. Create a robust data cleaning and structuring pipeline to transform raw scraped data into organized, 
        analysis-ready datasets.
        4. Create a unified database or index of the collected and structured data.
        5. Implement a multi-agent LLM system using RAG techniques to enable natural language querying of the collected data.
        6. Develop a user-friendly interface for submitting queries and displaying results, including source citations.
        7. Ensure ethical data collection practices, including respect for rate limits and terms of service.
        8. Incorporate data validation and quality assurance measures to ensure the reliability of collected information.

        Key Components and Technologies (specific libraries are subject to change):

        - Develop custom algorithms for handling domain-specific data formats

        Database and Indexing:
        - Utilize vector databases like Faiss or Pinecone for efficient similarity search
        - Implement document indexing for quick retrieval
        - Design a flexible schema to accommodate diverse data types

        Multi-Agent LLM System:
        - Integrate LLMs such as GPT-4 or LLAMA
        - Implement a RAG system using frameworks like LangChain or Hugging Face's RAG model
        - Develop specialized agents for different types of library data (e.g., catalog records, archival
         descriptions, transcriptions, PDF content)

         User Interface:
         - Create a web-based interface using Streamlit

         Evaluation and Optimization:

<h2>2 Dataset:</h2>
<pre><code>        The project will focus on data from the Library of Congress, including but not limited to:

        1. Collection guide (finding aid) XML: From https://findingaids.loc.gov/exist_collections/ead3master/
        2. Catalog record XML: From https://lccn.loc.gov/[record_number]/marcxml
        3. Audio, video, textual, and PDF content: Accessible via API from https://www.loc.gov/collections/
        4. Datasets: From https://www.loc.gov/collections/selected-datasets/
        5. Web archives: From https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/webarchive-datasets/
        6. Additional datasets: 
        From https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?q=library+of+congress&amp;_organization_limit=0&amp;organization=library-of-congress

        The project will involve creating a structured database from these diverse sources, which will serve as a 
        contribution to the open-source community. The database will be shared in a structured format for reproducibility
